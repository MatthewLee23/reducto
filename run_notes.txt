Aeres: total of fair_value_raw for 'HOLDINGS' type rows equals $830M which is equal to the private assets but misses the $192M in 
short term investments. The accurate total investments figure is $1,022M. It appears that the extraction model did not populate accurate
fair_raw_value which is in the report because there is no explicit header for this figure. the $192M in fair_value inherits the header
from the previous table on the same page

VALIDATION SYSTEM
================================================================================

When running main.py, extract responses are automatically validated and reports
are written to the validation_results/ folder.

OUTPUT FILES
------------
  validation_results/
    <stem>_validation.json   - Per-file validation report (detailed)
    summary.json             - Aggregated counts and issues by file
    summary.md               - Human-readable top errors report

VALIDATION CHECKS (all deterministic)
-------------------------------------
1. Response Shape
   - Checks required fields: result, usage, job_id, studio_link
   - Validates result.soi_rows exists and is a list
   - Validates job_id is UUID-shaped

2. Citation Integrity
   - Verifies citation bbox bounds are within [0,1]
   - Checks bbox.page is within document page range
   - Flags mismatches between value digits and citation content digits

3. Row Invariants
   - row_type must be HOLDING, SUBTOTAL, or TOTAL
   - HOLDING rows should have investment.value
   - SUBTOTAL/TOTAL rows should have label.value
   - Rows with "Total" labels should have numeric fields

4. Numeric Parseability + Arithmetic
   - Parses amounts using Decimal (handles commas, parentheses negatives, currencies)
   - Flags cells with multiple numeric tokens (extraction errors)
   - Compares sum(HOLDING fair_values) vs SUBTOTAL fair_value for each section_path
   - Same for cost and percent_net_assets columns

5. Metadata Consistency
   - Checks as_of_date year against filename date pattern (warning only)

TOLERANCES
----------
  Dollar amounts: $1 absolute tolerance
  Percentages:    0.01% absolute tolerance

These are "tight" tolerances. Arithmetic mismatches exceeding these thresholds
are flagged as errors.

ERROR CODES
-----------
  MISSING_TOP_FIELD        - Required top-level field missing
  INVALID_JSON_STRUCTURE   - Root is not a dict
  MISSING_SOI_ROWS         - result.soi_rows is missing
  INVALID_SOI_ROWS         - result.soi_rows is not a list
  MISSING_ROW_TYPE         - Row missing row_type field
  INVALID_ROW_TYPE         - row_type not in HOLDING/SUBTOTAL/TOTAL
  HOLDING_MISSING_INVESTMENT - HOLDING row has empty investment
  SUBTOTAL_MISSING_LABEL   - SUBTOTAL/TOTAL row has empty label
  TOTAL_MISSING_NUMERIC    - Total row has no numeric fields
  MULTIPLE_NUMERIC_TOKENS  - Cell contains multiple numbers (extraction error)
  ARITH_MISMATCH_FV        - Holdings fair_value sum != subtotal
  ARITH_MISMATCH_COST      - Holdings cost sum != subtotal
  ARITH_MISMATCH_PCT       - Holdings percent sum != subtotal
  CITATION_MISSING_KEY     - Citation missing required key
  BBOX_OUT_OF_RANGE        - bbox dimension outside [0,1]
  BBOX_PAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE   - bbox.page outside document range
  CITATION_VALUE_MISMATCH  - Value digits don't match citation content
  INVALID_JOB_ID           - job_id is not a valid UUID
  STUDIO_LINK_MISMATCH     - studio_link doesn't contain job_id
  DATE_MISMATCH            - as_of_date year differs from filename

USING VALIDATION RESULTS
------------------------
Review summary.md for a quick overview of top issues across all files.

For detailed investigation:
  1. Open the per-file _validation.json
  2. Look at "issues" array for specific errors with row numbers and context
  3. Cross-reference with the extract_urls/*_extract_response.json

Common patterns that indicate extraction problems:
  - MULTIPLE_NUMERIC_TOKENS: Two holdings merged into one row
  - ARITH_MISMATCH_*: Missing or duplicate holdings, or parsing errors
  - CITATION_VALUE_MISMATCH: Wrong cell was cited for a value
