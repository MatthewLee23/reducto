President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

At mid-year, economic conditions and government policies around the world are
far from homogeneous, and we expect them to continue to diverge. In the United
States, an ongoing economic expansion has brought the unemployment rate down to
levels where wage growth is likely to accelerate. Economic growth and fiscal
austerity have dramatically reduced the Federal budget deficit, while very
accommodative Federal Reserve System policies have kept interest rates
exceptionally low. In Europe and Japan, cyclical economic recoveries/ expansions
appear to be gaining traction, buttressed by aggressive quantitative easing
policies of central banks as well as cheaper currencies. China's ongoing
transition from an infrastructure investment-driven to a consumer-driven economy
and the dramatic decline in the price of oil -- largely a result of U.S.
"fracking" -- have benefited some countries while burdening others. On balance,
though, the global economic outlook has continued to improve, although economic
and geopolitical "storm clouds" remain.

Today's market environment presents numerous opportunities as well as challenges
for investors. While we believe that the capital markets may already have priced
in some recent trends, such as the U.S. dollar's appreciation against a basket
of global currencies, it is worth noting that investment risks and opportunities
are not always aligned with the economic outlook.

Since 1928, Pioneer's investment professionals have focused on identifying and
capitalizing on the investment opportunities that present themselves in a
variety of ever-changing economic and market conditions, including those we face
today, while seeking to limit the risk of the permanent impairment of our
clients' capital. Our ongoing goal is to deliver competitive returns consistent
with our strategies' stated style and objectives and consistent with our
shareholders' expectations over a range of market conditions. We believe our
shareowners benefit from the experience and tenure of our investment teams, the
insights generated from extensive research resources, and our commitment to
prudent risk management.

We encourage you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall
investment plan that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to
implement such a plan in a disciplined manner, as we do when managing the assets
our clients have entrusted to us.

We greatly appreciate your trust in us in the past and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/15

Helped by increasing demand from institutional investors, floating-rate bank
loans produced positive returns during the six-month period ended May 31, 2015.
In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that affected
the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six-month period. Mr.
Sharkey, a senior vice president and a portfolio manager at Pioneer, is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q   How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2015?

A   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.34% at net asset value and 5.75% at
    market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2015. During the same
    six-month period, the Trust's benchmark, the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans
    Index (the Barclays Index), returned 2.05% at net asset value. Unlike the
    Trust, the Barclays Index does not use leverage. While the use of leverage
    increases investment opportunity, it also increases investment risk. During
    the same six-month period, the average return (at market price) of the 22
    closed end funds in Lipper's Loan Participation Funds category (which may or
    may not be leveraged) was 4.84%.

    The shares of the Trust were selling at a 9.3% discount to net asset value
    on May 31, 2015.

    On May 31, 2015, the Trust's standard 30-day SEC yield was 5.35%*.

Q   How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
    six-month period ended May 31, 2015?

A   Overall, the backdrop for bank-loan investments was supportive during the
    six-month period. Healthy demand by investors especially from institutional
    investment pools known as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) helped
    sustain the loan market's momentum, even though some individual market
    participants began to move away from bank loans because of concerns that
    long-anticipated interest-rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the
    Fed) might occur later than previously expected. (Increases in interest
    rates are typically beneficial for the performance of bank loans, due to the
    floating-rate feature of the asset class.)

    Investors, in general, appeared confident in the strength of the U.S.
    economy at the beginning of the period (December 2014), but that confidence
    began to wane as the period progressed, especially when the gross domestic

    hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
    Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

    product (GDP) number for the first quarter of 2015 initially came in at a
    nearly flat 0.2%, and then was later revised downward into negative
    territory. The GDP report, however, was somewhat balanced out by other
    economic data which suggested that consumer spending and housing industry
    trends were positive, and that the domestic employment market was continuing
    to strengthen. The conflicting economic data did, however, have the result
    of delaying the market's expectations of when the Fed would begin tightening
    monetary policy through interest-rate hikes (as noted previously).

    The average bid in the loan market traded off from prices in the mid-$98
    range at the beginning of the period in early December to a low of $96.91
    near the end of the month, due to the sharp drop in oil prices and the
    spread widening it caused in both the high-yield and bank-loan markets.
    The high-yield market consists of roughly 16% energy issuers, and so the
    sell-off in high-yield bonds due to the drop in oil prices, and the
    subsequent yield increases had a contagion effect on floating-rate bank
    loans, approximately 4% of which are in the energy sector. By April 2015,
    however, loan prices had round-tripped and bounced back, due to: 1)
    year-end principal amortization payments; 2) a modest stabilization in oil
    loan prices after the precipitous drop at the end of 2014 and beginning of
    2015; and 3) anemic new-issue loan supply, which was at a five-year low in
    February, normally the largest new-issue month on the bank-loan calendar.
    The decline in new loan issues owed mainly to new and tighter Fed
    standards for leveraged buy-out loan deals. In addition, a significant
    portion of the loan market was bid at above par value by April, a
    development which then muted price appreciation for the remainder of the
    six-month period as refinancings began to increase, given the supply/demand
    imbalance.

Q   Which of your investment strategies or security selections had the largest
    effects on the Trust's performance relative to its benchmark, the Barclays
    Index, during the six-month period ended May 31, 2015?

A   The Trust outperformed the Barclays Index during the six-month period, as
    good overall security selection results outweighed sector allocation
    performance. With regard to specific sectors, the Trust's overweight in
    consumer non-cyclicals and underweights in energy and utilities contributed
    to benchmark-relative returns, as did the performance of the loans the
    portfolio held in those sectors. In consumer non-cyclicals, the Trust's
    overweight was small relative to the benchmark during the period, while the
    underweights in energy and utilities were moderate (just over 100

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15 5
<PAGE>

    basis points, or "bps", relative to the benchmark in each of the sectors).
    With regard to energy loans, the sector suffered through a sell-off in the
    early part of the six-month period in reaction to sharply declining oil
    prices.

    On the negative side, the Trust's underweights compared with the Barclays
    Index in the information technology and consumer cyclical loan sectors
    detracted from benchmark-relative performance. Information technology
    represented the Trust's biggest sector underweight during the six-month
    period, while the underweight in consumer cyclicals was also significant.

    With regard to individual portfolio investments, the Trust's benchmark-
    relative results were aided during the period by positions in loans to
    Virtual Radiologic, a medical technology company that announced it was being
    acquired by another company; loans to Wausau Paper; loans to Orica
    Chemicals, both of which strongly traded up in value upon new issue; and
    loans to Endemol, a producer of television programming which benefited from
    an improved earnings outlook.

    Individual portfolio investments that detracted from the Trust's
    benchmark-relative results during the period included positions in loans to
    weight-loss company Weight Watchers International, which continued to lose
    market share as it faced new forms of competition, such as weight-loss
    applications available on Smartphones; loans to energy companies Samson
    Investment, whose liquidity was strained due to the drop in oil prices, and
    Expro, a provider of oil-rig testing equipment which suffered from a reduced
    oil-rig count during the period; and loans to Appvion, a manufacturer of
    coated paper products which experienced a weaker pricing environment while
    dealing with international competition.

Q   How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the six-month period
    ended May 31, 2015?

A   At the end of the six-month period on May 31, 2015, 32.7% of the Trust's
    total managed assets were financed by leverage obtained through a revolving
    credit facility, compared with 32.9% of the Trust's total managed assets
    financed by leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2014.

    While the dollar amount of borrowed funds employed by the Trust during the
    period did not increase or decrease, the percentage decrease was due to an
    increase in the values of securities in which the Trust had invested.

Q   Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the six-month
    period ended May 31, 2015, and did those investments have an effect on
    performance?

A   We did invest in a small number of currency forward contracts during the
    six-month period. The investments did not have a material impact on the
    Trust's relative results. We invested in the currency forwards in an attempt
    to hedge, or reduce, the risks associated with the Trust's exposure to
    securities denominated in foreign currencies.

<PAGE>

Q   What factors affected the Trust's yield during the six-month period ended
    May 31, 2015?

A   The Trust was able to increase its dividend payout to shareholders late in
    the six-month period, as the current income earned by the Trust had exceeded
    the earlier payout rate. This was primarily attributable to spreads widening
    by nearly 25 basis points during the period, and to changes made in 2014 to
    the Trust's investment strategies that permit the Trust to invest a greater
    percentage of its assets in non-U.S. domiciled companies and second-lien
    loans.

    However, shareholders should keep in mind that, during a period when the
    general level of interest rates continued to decline and the Treasury yield
    curve became flatter, many corporations retired older loans and refinanced
    their debt at lower spreads. If the pace of refinancings continues at
    present levels, or increases, the Trust's dividend payout could be adversely
    affected. Over the longer term, though, we do expect interest rates to begin
    increasing at some point, and higher interest rates in the future should
    cause floating-rate loans to generate greater levels of current income.

Q   What is your investment outlook?

A   Despite the weak GDP report for the first quarter of 2015, we expect U.S.
    economic growth to be positive for the full 2015 calendar year, averaging in
    the 2.5% to 3.0% range. Such growth levels should be good for corporate
    credit, including bank loans. In general, domestic corporations remain in
    sound financial shape, with healthy balance sheets and sufficient cash flows
    to meet their debt obligations. Default rates for bank loans, as of period
    end, were at well below longer-term historical patterns, and we believe they
    are likely to remain low for the next 12 months. At the same time, the
    issuance of new loans for investments has been restrained, keeping market
    supply limited.

    One of the principal risks to the floating-rate bank loan market is that the
    Fed could continue to delay raising interest rates. Another risk is that
    there could be a change in the currently favorable supply-demand
    relationship in the market, either due to a spike in new-loan issuance or
    because financing challenges begin to hamper the creation of new CLOs.

    Our overall outlook for the bank-loan market remains positive, as we believe
    the domestic economy is fundamentally strong and we continue to expect that
    the Fed will tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates before the
    end of the calendar year, a move that should have a positive impact on the
    performance of bank loans due to their floating-rate feature.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-38 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt
to increase the fund's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered
speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using derivatives can
increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when the market prices,
interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can increase price
fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of their value at
times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the market price of
illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment of the
Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage creates
significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less
total liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases under
the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

* The Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index measures the performance of
high-yield loans. Since comparisons for the Barclays Index begin in 2006, the
chart assumes an initial investment of $10,065, which is equal to the Trust's
value at 12/30/2005.

** The CS Leveraged Loan Index (the CS Index) is a representative index of
tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The CS Index began in
January 1992. Comparisons to the Trust for the CS Index begin in 2004. The CS
Index was the Trust's benchmark through March 1, 2011, and was at that time
replaced by the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
Index). Because the historical performance of the Barclays Index dates back only
to 2005, after the inception of the Trust in 2004, the Trust will continue to
provide "Market Value of $10,000 Investment" comparisons for both the CS Index
and the Barclays Index.

Returns of both indices are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
The indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

+   Return for the CS Leveraged Loan Index covers the 10-year period from May
    31, 2005, through May 31, 2015. Return for the Barclays U.S. High Yield
    Loans Index covers the maximum period for which that index's performance is
    available (December 30, 2005 through May 31, 2015).

</TABLE>

*   The amount of distributions made to shareowners during the period were in
    excess of the net investment income earned by the Trust during the period.
    The Trust has accumulated undistributed net investment income which is
    part of the Trust's NAV. A portion of the accumulated net investment income
    was distributed to shareowners during the period. A decrease in
    distributions may have a negative effect on the market value of the Trust's
    shares.

(a) The per common share data presented above is based upon the average common
    shares outstanding for the periods presented.

(b) Amount rounds to less than $(0.005) per share.

(c) Net asset value and market value are published in Barron's on Saturday, The
    Wall Street Journal on Monday and The New York Times on Monday and Saturday.

(d) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common shares
    at the current market value on the first day and a sale at the current
    market value on the last day of the periods reported. Dividends and
    distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be
    reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.
    Total investment return does not reflect brokerage commissions. Past
    performance is not a guarantee of future results.

(e) Not annualized.

(f) Expense ratios do not reflect the effect of distribution payments to
    preferred shareowners.

(g) Includes interest expense of 0.51%, 0.49%, 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.0%,

Notes to Financial Statements | 5/31/15 (unaudited)

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust
will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent
consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
    loan interests (senior loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
    established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
    bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
    Loan Pricing Corporation, an independent pricing service. If price
    information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation or if the price
    information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
    from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
    quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing service
    broker quotes will be solicited. Fixed-income securities are valued at
    prices supplied by independent pricing services, which consider such factors
    as market prices, market events, quotations from one or more brokers,
    Treasury spreads, yields, maturities and ratings. Valuations may be
    supplemented by dealers and other sources, as required. Event-linked bonds
    are valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
    service. Other insurance-linked securities may be valued at the bid price
    obtained from an independent pricing service, or through a third party using
    a pricing matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value
    methods or techniques to

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15 45
<PAGE>

    provide an estimated value of the instrument. Equity securities that have
    traded on an exchange are valued at the last sale price on the principal
    exchange where they are traded. Equity securities that have not traded on
    the date of valuation or securities for which sale prices are not available,
    generally are valued using the mean between the last bid and asked prices.
    Shares of money market mutual funds are valued at such funds' net asset
    value.

    Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
    times prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The values
    of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's
    shares are determined as of such times.

    Securities for which independent pricing services are unable to supply
    prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are not readily
    available or are considered to be unreliable are valued by a fair valuation
    team comprised of certain personnel of Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.
    (PIM), the Trust's investment adviser, pursuant to procedures adopted by the
    Trust's Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team uses fair value methods
    approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. PIM's
    valuation team is responsible for monitoring developments that may impact
    fair valued securities and for discussing and assessing fair value on an
    ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the Valuation Committee of the
    Board of Trustees.

    Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may include
    credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current market
    conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value methods
    if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the close of
    the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to the
    determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
    event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
    natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation
    of the Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and
    such differences could be material.

    At May 31, 2015, there were no securities valued using fair value methods
    (other than securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
    services, broker-dealers or using a third party insurance industry pricing
    model).

B.  Investment Income and Transactions

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
    are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend date in
    the exercise of reasonable diligence.

    Interest income, including interest on income bearing cash accounts, is
    recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at
    the applicable country rates.

46 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15
<PAGE>

    Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted or
    amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield
    to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost
    basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
    mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
    monthly paydowns.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
    represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
    currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
    between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

    The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
    the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
    future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
    exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
    are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records realized
    gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a closing
    transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise
    upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
    movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

E.  Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
    shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As of
    November 30, 2014, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties with
    respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be recorded
    as

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15 47
<PAGE>

    an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax returns filed
    within the prior three years remain subject to examination by federal and
    state tax authorities.

    The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
    shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
    which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
    Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
    temporary overdistributions for financial statement and tax purposes.
    Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent
    book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for
    temporary differences.

    The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareholders will
    be determined at the end of the current taxable year.

    The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the year ended
    November 30, 2014 was as follows:

    ============================================================================
</TABLE>

    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
    primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
    gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
    differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
    difference between book and tax amortization methods and discounts on fixed
    income securities and book/tax temporary differences.

F.  Risks

    Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
    Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
    in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
    those

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15
<PAGE>

    documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
    Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
    interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
    economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
    those industries and sectors.

    The Trust invests primarily in senior loans. The Trust may also invest in
    other floating and variable rate instruments, including second lien loans,
    investment grade fixed-income debt securities and high yield, high risk
    corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below investment grade
    securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly referred to as
    "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's
    capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Below investment grade
    securities, including floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are
    subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid and more difficult
    to value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
    higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
    that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if
    any, securing a floating rate loan can decline or may decline or may be
    insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to
    liquidate. No active trading market may exist for floating rate loans, and
    many loans are subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market may
    be subject to irregular trading activity and extended settlement periods.

    Event-linked bonds are floating rate debt obligations for which the return
    of principal and the payment of interest are contingent on the
    non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an
    earthquake of a specific magnitude. The trigger event's magnitude may be
    based on losses to a company or industry, industry indexes or readings of
    scientific instruments, or may be based on specified actual losses. If a
    trigger event, as defined within the terms of an event-linked bond occurs,
    the Trust may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest and/or principal
    invested in such event-linked bond. The Trust is entitled to receive
    principal and interest payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the
    description and magnitude specified by the instrument. In addition to the
    specified trigger events, event-linked bonds may expose the Trust to other
    risks, including but not limited to issuer (credit) default, adverse
    regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

    The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles ("SPVs")
    or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurer's
    catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share instruments (sometimes
    referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance relating to
    specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
    collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
    reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs"),

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15 49
<PAGE>

    are subject to the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, because
    quota share instruments represent an interest in a basket of underlying
    reinsurance contracts, the Trust has limited transparency into the
    individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk
    assessment and sound underwriting practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it
    may be more difficult for PIM to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile
    of the Trust's investment in quota share instruments and therefore place the
    Trust's assets at greater risk of loss than if PIM had more complete
    information. These securities may be impossible or difficult to purchase,
    sell or unwind and may be difficult to value.

    The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
    developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in
    a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
    conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
    currency exchange restrictions.

    The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
    invested in securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities may be
    difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the Trust believes it is
    desirable to do so and their market price is generally more volatile than
    that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult
    to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may
    restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

G.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
    required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trust's custodian or a sub-custodian of the Trust. PIM is
    responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
    least equal to the repurchase price.

H.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
    automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
    Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
    of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in
    the Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends
    and capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
    completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
    penalty by notifying

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15
<PAGE>

    American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in
    administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to any dividend
    record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with
    respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

    If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
    other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
    the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
    the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
    or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in common shares of
    the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

    Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
    participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
    acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
    but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
    outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
    on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share
    is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
    trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend
    amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common
    shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing the
    dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the
    date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
    current market price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common
    share is greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent
    will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market
    purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued
    common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
    brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
    purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any
    federal, state or local taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any
    taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may be
    able to transfer the shares to another broker and continue to participate in
    the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15 51
<PAGE>

not include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the six months ended May 31, 2015, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.06% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May 31, 2015,
$367,838 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative costs
and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee payable" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at negotiated
rates.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Trust's custodian expenses. For the six months ended May 31, 2015, the Trust
expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.

5. Unfunded and Bridge Loan Commitments

As of May 31, 2015, the Trust had no unfunded loan commitments.

The Trust had the following bridge loans outstanding at May 31, 2015:

7. Loan Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all the Trust's auction market preferred shares (see Note 8).
Effective November 29, 2014, the Trust extended the maturity of the Credit
Agreement for a 12 month period.

At May 31, 2015, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $154,450,000. The interest rate charged at May 31, 2015 was
1.04%. The average daily balance was $154,576,374 at an average interest rate of
1.04%. With respect to the margin agreement, interest expense of $798,703 is
included in the Statement of Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the margin loan financing agreement. Asset coverage is
calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank
loans and senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such
amount by the principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Redemption of AMPS

The Trust redeemed all outstanding Series M7 Auction Market Preferred Shares
(AMPS) on December 3, 2013, all Series W7 AMPS on December 5, 2013 and all TH7
AMPS on December 6, 2013.

9. Dividends to Preferred Shareholders

Prior to the redemption of the Trust's AMPS (See Note 8), dividends on Series
M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 were cumulative at a rate which was to be reset
every seven days based on the results of an auction. Since February 2008, the
Trust's auctions related to the AMPS failed. Accordingly, the Trust paid the
maximum dividend rate for each series, which was the greater of 125% of the one
week LIBOR rate or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. There were no
dividends payable on AMPS during the period from December 1, 2013 to the
redemption of Series M7 AMPS on December 3, 2013, Series W7 AMPS on December 5,
2013 and Series TH7 AMPS on December 6, 2013.

10. Subsequent Events

A monthly dividend was declared on June 2, 2015 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0600 per common share, payable June 30,
2015, to common shareowners of record on June 17, 2015.

11. Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Trustees of the Trust, with the approval and recommendation of the
Audit Committee, appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Trust's
independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending
November 30, 2014. Deloitte & Touche LLP replaced Ernst & Young LLP, which
resigned as the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm, effective
upon completion of the audit of the Trust's financial statements for the fiscal
year ended November 30, 2013.

During the periods that Ernst & Young LLP served as the Trust's independent
registered public accounting firm, including the Trust's fiscal years ending
November 30, 2013 and November 30, 2012, Ernst & Young LLP's reports on the
financial statements of the Trust have not contained an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and have not been qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles. Further, there have been no disagreement
with Ernst & Young LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,

54 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/15
<PAGE>

which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP would have
caused Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement in connection with its report on the financial statements. In
addition, there have been no reportable events of the kind described in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which have not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its common
shares in the open market.

PIM, the Trust's investment adviser, is currently an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of UniCredit. On April 23, 2015, UniCredit announced that it signed a
preliminary and exclusive agreement with Banco Santander and affiliates of
Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic (the "Private Equity Firms") with respect to
Pioneer Investments ("Pioneer") and Santander Asset Management ("SAM") (the
"Transaction").

The Transaction, as described in the UniCredit announcement, will entail the
establishment of a holding company, with the name Pioneer Investments, to be
owned by UniCredit (50%) and the Private Equity Firms (50% between them). The
holding company will control Pioneer's U.S. operations, including the Adviser.
The holding company also will own 66.7% of Pioneer's and SAM's combined
operations outside the U.S., while Banco Santander will own directly the
remaining 33.3% stake. The completion of the Transaction is subject to the
signing of a definitive agreement, as well as certain regulatory and corporate
approvals, and other conditions.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, completion of the Transaction will
cause the Trust's investment advisory agreement with the Adviser to
terminate. In connection with the Transaction, the Trust's Board of Trustees
will be asked to approve a new investment advisory agreement for the Trust. If
approved by the Board, the Trust's new investment advisory agreement will be
submitted to the shareholders of the Trust for their approval.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust were $9,876

control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
