            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Members of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2007, and the results of its operations, the changes in its members' capital,
its cash flows and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of investments at March 31, 2007 by
correspondence with the custodian and portfolio funds, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by the
Fund valued at $173,177,526 (97.58% of the Fund's net assets) at March 31, 2007,
the values of which have been fair valued by the Investment Manager based on
estimates provided by each portfolio fund, under the general supervision of the
Board of Directors, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values. These
estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been
used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could
be material.

                              Financial Highlights

The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable by the average of total monthly  members'  capital.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

(a)  Annualized, except for organizational and offering expenses if applicable.

(b)  The Adviser waived $15,369 of management  fees for the year ended March 31,
     2003. The net  investment  loss prior to incentive  allocation  ratio would
     have been  (1.87%)  and the  expense  ratio  would  have  been  1.91% on an
     annualized  basis for that  period  had these  fees not been  waived by the
     Adviser.  Pursuant to an expense deferral agreement,  the Adviser requested
     reimbursement  of deferred  expenses  during the years ended March 31, 2004
     and 2005, and agreed to forego  reimbursement of deferred  expenses in each
     of those years also.  Reimbursement to the Adviser of deferred  expenses is
     included in the expense ratios for the periods in which such  reimbursement
     was requested.

(c)  Expenses of the underlying  Portfolio Funds are not included in the expense
     ratios.

(d)  Calculated  based on the  amount  reallocable  to the  Special  Members  at
     December 31, 2006 for the period April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 in
     addition  to the  amount  that  would have been  allocable  to the  Special

1.   ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end  management  investment company and
is  operating  as a  diversified  investment  company.  The Fund has many of the
features of a private  investment fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests")  are
offered  only in  private  placements  to persons  (i) who are both  "accredited
investors"  under the Securities  Act of 1933 and "qualified  clients" under the
Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  as amended and (ii) who meet other  investor
eligibility criteria established by the Fund. The primary investment  objectives
of the  Fund are to  provide  investors  (i) an  attractive,  long-term  rate of
return,  on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted  basis,  (ii) low performance
volatility  and (iii)  minimal  correlation  with the  equity  and fixed  income
markets.  The Fund employs a multi-strategy,  multi-manager  investment strategy
premised  on the risk  control  benefits of  diversification  and the value of a
hedged  investment  approach.  The Fund seeks  diversification  by  investing in
partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio Funds") that (i) pursue
non-traditional  investment  strategies  and (ii) are  expected to exhibit a low
degree of performance  correlation,  not only with broad market indices but also
with each  other.  These  Portfolio  Funds are  managed by  selected  investment
managers  ("Investment  Managers") who specialize in the chosen strategies.  The
Fund generally invests in between 25 and 50 Portfolio Funds.

Banc of America  Investment  Advisors,  Inc.  ("Adviser")  is the SEC registered
investment  adviser  to  the  Fund.  The  Adviser  is an  indirect  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Bank of America  Corporation  ("BAC").  The Adviser has  retained
Grosvenor  Capital  Management,   L.P.  ("Grosvenor"  or  the  "Subadviser")  as
subadviser to the Fund. The Adviser and the Subadviser  have been  designated as
special members (the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's  investments are valued by the Adviser as of the close of business on
the last business day of each month in accordance  with policies and  procedures
approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Portfolio
Funds may be subject to limitations on redemptions,  including the assessment of
early redemption fees. In addition, market quotations for such interests are not
available.  As a result, the Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds are valued at
fair  value,  which  normally  will be the  value  determined  by the  portfolio
managers or  administrators  of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such value of the Fund's
interest in a Portfolio Fund generally represents the Fund's proportionate share
of the net assets of the Portfolio Fund. The value of the Fund's  investments in
Portfolio  Funds is  generally  increased  by  additional  contributions  to the
Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from the  Portfolio  Funds
and  decreased  by  withdrawals  and the  Fund's  share of net  losses  from the
Portfolio funds. The Fund, the Adviser, and the Subadviser rely upon audited and
unaudited  reports and estimates  prepared by or for the Portfolio  Fund and any
other  information  that they may receive from the Portfolio Fund,  which may be
subject to adjustment by the Portfolio Fund or its manager or administrator. The
values  assigned to the Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may not represent
amounts  that would  ultimately  be realized,  as such amounts  depend on future
circumstances  and  cannot be  determined  until the  liquidation  of the Fund's
interest in the Portfolio Fund. The estimated  value of the Fund's  interests in
Portfolio  Funds  may  differ   significantly   from  the  value  received  upon
liquidation.  The Fund,  the  Adviser,  and the  Subadviser  will not be able to
confirm  independently the accuracy of the valuations  provided by the Portfolio
Funds or their portfolio managers or administrators.

Portfolio Funds, or their administrator or portfolio managers,  generally use an
independent  pricing source to value the funds'  securities.  Securities with no
readily  available  market value are initially  valued at cost,  with subsequent
adjustments to values, which reflect either meaningful third-party  transactions
in the private market, or fair value deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Fund or
its portfolio  manager or  administrator.  In such instances,  consideration may
also be given to the financial  condition  and operating  results of the issuer,
the amount that the Portfolio  Funds can  reasonably  expect to realize upon the
sale of the securities and other factors deemed  relevant by the Portfolio Funds
or its portfolio manager or administrator.


                                       12
<PAGE>

               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


Some of the  Portfolio  Funds may  invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
illiquid  securities  and  may  hold  all  or a  portion  of  these  investments
separately from the rest of their portfolio.  These separate baskets of illiquid
securities may be subject to  restrictions  on liquidation  that are more strict
than the liquidity restrictions applicable to general interests in the Portfolio
Fund. If the Fund  liquidates its interests in such a Portfolio  Fund, it may be
required to maintain these illiquid  securities for an extended  period of time.
The value of these baskets of illiquid securities may fluctuate significantly.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of
legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and sales of Portfolio Funds are recorded as
of the last day of legal  ownership  or  participation.  Purchases  and sales of
other securities are accounted for on the trade-date  basis.  Realized gains and
losses are recorded at the time of disposition  of the respective  investment on
an average cost basis.

D.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

E.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

F.   CASH

At March 31,  2007, a total of  $11,246,698  in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust Company,  the Fund's custodian.  Of that amount,  $1,990,107 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

G.   FUTURES

The Fund utilized futures  contracts during the period ended March 31, 2007. The
Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical hedging purposes. Initial margin
deposits of cash and securities  are made upon entering into futures  contracts.
The  contracts are marked to market  monthly and the resulting  changes in value
are accounted for as unrealized gains and losses.  Variation margin payments are
paid or  received,  depending  upon  whether  unrealized  gains  or  losses  are
incurred.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss
equal to the difference

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

between the proceeds  from (or cost of) the closing  transaction  and the amount
invested in the contract.

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures transaction. Finally, the risk exists that losses
could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of  investments or statement of
assets and liabilities.

H.   OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the  obligation,  to buy or sell a
specified  item at a fixed price during a specified  period for a  nonrefundable
fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase  of these  options  are
included in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and  members'  capital as an
investment  and  subsequently  marked-to-market  to  reflect  the  value  of the
options,  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses  included  in  the  statement  of
operations.

As a writer  of  options,  the Fund  receives  a  premium  and bears the risk of
unfavorable  changes  in the  prices  of the  securities  or  index  instruments
underlying  the  options.  Premiums  received  from writing put and call options
which have not expired are presented in the liabilities section of the statement
of assets,  liabilities and members'  capital and  subsequently  adjusted to the
current  market  value of the options  written,  but not less than zero.  If the
current  market value of an option exceeds the premium  received,  the excess is
recorded as an  unrealized  loss and,  conversely,  if the  premium  exceeds the
current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an unrealized gain.

3.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income, gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the


                                       14

management fee paid by the Fund) over such fiscal  period,  before giving effect
to any  distributions  and repurchases of Interests (or portions thereof) by the
Fund as of the end of such period and any capital  contributions made at the end
of such period  (such  capital  contributions  being deemed to be made as of the
next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2006 and December 31, 2006. The interests  redeemed pursuant to such tenders are
shown in the Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

4.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

For the year ended March 31, 2007,  aggregate  purchases  and sales of Portfolio
Funds amounted to $28,900,000, and $45,601,998, respectively.

5.   MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


6.   INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive  Period.  The Hurdle
Rate Amounts for June 30, 2006, September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006, and March
31, 2007 were 4.904%,  5.312%,  4.890%, and 5.002% per annum,  respectively.  On
June 30,  2006 and  December  31,  2006,  incentive  allocations  of $45,642 and
$921,705 were realized, respectively.  Additional capital of $441,076 would have
been reallocable to the Special Members had the Members'  measurement period for
incentive allocation closed on March 31, 2007.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


7.   ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC")  (also an affiliate  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,  investor related  services,  and
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
and the administrator  based primarily upon month-end Members' capital,  subject
to a monthly minimum fee.

8.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each manager who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund,  as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each
meeting attended.  Any manager or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund.  All managers are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

Investors  who  tendered  interests  in the Fund prior to the  December 31, 2005
tender  period were not paid interest on their  contingent  payment as stated on
the tender offer documents.  As a result, these investors were due interest from
the Fund in the aggregate  amount of $12,070  representing  the unpaid  interest
amount due to investors  from the date of the original  tender  payment  through
June 30,  2006.  The Adviser  reimbursed  the Fund for unpaid  interest  paid to
investors in the amount of $12,070, which activity is reflected in the statement
of changes in members' capital for the year ended March 31, 2007.

9.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


9.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Members and will not be  exchangeable  for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund  significant  repurchases.  Members
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be remote.

10.  LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in connection  with matters  relating to mutual fund
trading.  A  copy  of  the  SEC  Orders  is  available  on the  SEC  website  at
http://www.sec.gov.  A copy of the NYAG  Settlements is available as part of the
Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

10.  LITIGATION EVENT (CONTINUED)

In  connection  with the events that  resulted in the NYAG  Settlements  and SEC
Orders,   various  parties  have  filed  suit  against  certain  Columbia  Funds
(including   former  Nations  Funds),   the  Trustees  of  the  Columbia  Funds,
FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent of the Adviser) and certain
of its affiliated entities and/or Bank of America Corporation and certain of its
affiliated entities. More than 300 cases, including those filed against entities
unaffiliated  with the  Columbia  Funds,  their  Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial
Corporation and its affiliated  entities and/or Bank of America  Corporation and
its affiliated entities, have been transferred to a multi-district proceeding in
the Federal District Court in Maryland for consolidated or coordinated  pretrial
proceedings.  The parties have reached  settlements  or settlements in principle
with respect to the claims in the proceeding  concerning the Columbia Funds. All
such  settlements are subject to court  approval.  Certain other actions against
certain  Columbia  Funds,  the  Trustees of the  Columbia  Funds,  advisers  and
affiliated   entities,   alleging   among  other  things   excessive   fees  and
inappropriate  use of fund assets for distribution and other improper  purposes,
have been  consolidated  in the  Massachusetts  federal  court as IN RE COLUMBIA
ENTITIES  Litigation on March 2, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the judge dismissed
all claims by plaintiffs and entered final judgment in favor of the  defendants.
The  plaintiffs  appealed  to the United  States  Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit on December 30, 2005.  A  stipulation  and  settlement  agreement  dated
January 19, 2007 was filed in the First  Circuit on February  14,  2007,  with a
joint  stipulation  of dismissal and motion for remand to obtain  district court
approval  of the  settlement.  That joint  motion was granted and the appeal was
dismissed. On March 6, 2007, the case was remanded to the District Court. On May
11, 2007, the District Court entered a preliminary  approval order which granted
preliminary approval of the settlement. A final settlement hearing, at which the
District Court will determine whether the proposed  settlement should be finally
approved and the action dismissed on the merits with prejudice, is scheduled for
September  18, 2007.  The terms of the  settlement,  if finally  approved,  will
require payments by one or more affiliates of the Adviser,  including payment of
plaintiffs'  attorneys' fees and notice to class members.  In the event that the
settlement is not finally approved,  the plaintiffs may elect to go forward with
their  appeal and no  opinion  is  expressed  regarding  the  likely  outcome or
financial impact of such appeal on any fund.

11.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued FASB
interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes". This
standard  defines the  threshold  for  recognizing  the  benefits of  tax-return
positions in the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing  authority and requires  measurement of a tax position meeting the
more-likely-than- not criterion,  based on the largest benefit that is more than
50 percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of the
first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. At adoption, companies must
adjust their  financial  statements to reflect only those tax positions that are
more-likely-than-  not to be sustained as of the adoption  date. As of March 31,
2007,  the Fund does not  expect the  impact of the  adoption  of FIN 48 will be
material to the financial statements.

In September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
STATEMENT  ON  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  (SFAS)  NO.  157,  "FAIR  VALUE
MEASUREMENTS." This standard  establishes a single  authoritative  definition of
fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  requires
additional  disclosures about fair value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value  measurements  already  required or permitted by existing  standards.
SFAS No. 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal  years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The  changes  to  current  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  from the
application  of this  Statement  relate to the  definition  of fair  value,  the
methods used to measure  fair value,  and the  expanded  disclosures  about fair
value measurements. As of March 31, 2007, the Fund does not believe the adoption
of SFAS No. 157 will impact the amounts  reported in the  financial  statements,
however, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop
the measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements  reported on the
Statement of Changes in Investors' Capital for a fiscal period.

12.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent to March 31, 2007, the Fund received additional capital contributions
of $12,646,415.






The Fund files its complete  schedule of portfolio  holdings with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on
Form N-Q within  sixty days after the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is
available on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov, and may be reviewed
and  copied  at the  Commission's  Public  Reference  Room in  Washington,  D.C.
Information  on the  operation of the Public  Reference  Room may be obtained by
calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

     to the registrant for an engagement that relates directly to the operations
     and financial reporting of the registrant.

     (e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          The  registrant's  Audit  Committee  is  required to  pre-approve  the
     engagement of the registrant's independent accountants to provide audit and
     permissible  non-audit services to the registrant and non-audit services to
     its  investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role is
     primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or overseen by
     another  investment  adviser) or any entity  controlling,  controlled by or
     under common  control with such  investment  adviser that provides  ongoing
     services  to the  registrant  ("Adviser  Affiliates"),  if  the  engagement
     relates   directly  to  the  operations  or  financial   reporting  of  the
     registrant.


<PAGE>

          The Audit Committee has adopted a Policy for Engagement of Independent
     Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit  Services  ("Policy").  The Policy sets
     forth the understanding of the Audit Committee  regarding the engagement of
     the  registrant's   independent   accountants  to  provide  (i)  audit  and
     permissible  audit-related,  tax  and  other  services  to  the  registrant
     (collectively "Fund Services"); (ii) non-audit services to the registrant's
     investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser  whose role is primarily
     portfolio  management  and is  subcontracted  with or  overseen  by another
     investment  adviser)  and Adviser  Affiliates,  if the  engagement  relates
     directly  to the  operations  or  financial  reporting  of  the  registrant
     (collectively  "Fund-related  Adviser  Services");  and (iii) certain other
     audit and non-audit  services to the registrant's  investment  adviser (not
     including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio  management and
     is  subcontracted  with or  overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and
     Adviser Affiliates.  Unless a type of service receives general pre-approval
     under the Policy, it requires specific  pre-approval by the Audit Committee
     if it is to be provided by the  independent  accountants.  Pre-approval  of
     non-audit services to the registrant,  the registrant's  investment adviser
     (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management
     and is subcontracted  with or overseen by another  investment  adviser) and
     Adviser   Affiliates   may  be  waived   provided  that  the  "de  minimis"
     requirements  set  forth  under  paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of  Rule  2-01 of
     Regulation S-X are met.

          Under  the  Policy,  the Audit  Committee  may  delegate  pre-approval
     authority  to any  pre-designated  member or  members  who are  independent
     directors.  The member(s) to whom such  authority is delegated must report,
     for  informational  purposes only, any pre-approval  decisions to the Audit
     Committee   at  its   next   regular   meeting.   The   Audit   Committee's
     responsibilities  with respect to the pre-approval of services performed by
     the independent accountants may not be delegated to management.

          The Policy  requires  the Fund  Treasurer  or his or her  designee  to
     submit to the Audit Committee,  on an annual basis, a schedule of the types
     of  services  that are  subject to general  pre-approval.  The  schedule(s)
     provide a  description  of each type of service  that is subject to general
     pre-approval and, where possible,  will provide estimated fee caps for each
     instance of providing  each service.  The Audit  Committee  will review and
     approve the types of services  and review the  projected  fees for the next
     fiscal  year  and  may  add to,  or  subtract  from,  the  list of  general
     pre-approved services from time to time based on subsequent determinations.
     That approval  acknowledges  that the Audit  Committee is in agreement with
     the specific  types of services that the  independent  accountants  will be
     permitted to perform. The Fund Treasurer or his or her designee must update
     the fee amounts to the extent necessary at each of the regularly  scheduled
     meetings of the Audit Committee.


(e)(2) The  percentage of services  described in  paragraphs  (b) through (d) of
       this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
       (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the fiscal years ended
       March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 was zero.

(f)  Not applicable.

(g)  During  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2006  and  March  31,  2007,
     respectively,  aggregate  non-audit fees of approximately $25.1 Million and
     $27.3 Million were billed by the registrant's  principal  accountant to the
     registrant's  investment adviser (not including a sub-adviser whose role is
     primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another
     investment  adviser) and any entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under
     common control with the investment  adviser that provides  ongoing services
     to the registrant.


<PAGE>

(h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  considered  whether the  provision  of
     non-audit  services  rendered to the registrant's  investment  adviser (not
     including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio  management and
     is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment  adviser),  and any
     entity  controlling,  controlled  by,  or  under  common  control  with the
     investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant that
     were  not   pre-approved  is  compatible  with  maintaining  the  principal
     accountant's independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.



ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.



ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The   registrant   has   delegated  to  Grosvenor   Capital   Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor"),  its sub-adviser,  the responsibility to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered  investment  adviser like  Grosvenor  to  implement  proxy voting
policies and procedures  reasonably designed to ensure that they vote proxies in
the best  interests  of their  clients.  Pursuant  to that rule,  Grosvenor  has
adopted Proxy Voting  Policies and Procedures  (the "Proxy  Policies") that have
been designed to ensure that  Grosvenor  votes proxies in the best  interests of
the various  investment  management  accounts that  Grosvenor  manages  (each, a
"GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNT").

WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS

Each Grosvenor-Managed  Account is either: (i) a "fund of funds" that invests in
underlying  investment funds ("PORTFOLIO FUNDS") but does not invest directly in
securities of operating  companies  except on a limited basis or (ii) a "feeder"
fund that invests in such a "fund of funds."

As a result, the most common scenario in which Grosvenor is requested to respond
to proxy requests  relating to securities held by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts is where Grosvenor is requested to vote limited partnership  interests,
limited  liability  company  interests,  shares or similar  equity  interests in
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest. In rare
cases,  Grosvenor  is requested to vote on matters  relating to  investments  in
operating companies.

<PAGE>


For  purposes  of  convenience,  each  request  to  vote a  security  held  by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is referred to as a "PROXY REQUEST."

MATERIAL PROPOSALS AND IMMATERIAL PROPOSALS

Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories,  those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

An  "IMMATERIAL  PROPOSAL"  is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD NOT, in the
reasonable  judgment  of  the  Grosvenor   Compliance  Officer  responsible  for
reviewing the  proposal,  either:  (a) be  reasonably  likely to have a material
adverse effect on the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) (E.G., a proposal to
approve a change in the name of a Portfolio Fund, to approve a Portfolio  Fund's
previous  year's audited  financial  statements,  to approve a Portfolio  Fund's
appointment  of  independent  auditors,  to elect new  directors  of a Portfolio
Fund); or (b) materially  adversely change the terms on which future investments
may be made by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  A  proposal  that,  if
adopted,  would change any one or more terms in a manner that is  favorable,  or
not  materially  adverse,  to  existing or future  investors  is  considered  an
"Immaterial Proposal."

A "MATERIAL  PROPOSAL" is a proposal that, if adopted,  WOULD, in the reasonable
judgment of the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  responsible  for reviewing  such
proposal,  either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s);  or (b) materially adversely change
the   terms  on  which   future   investments   may  be  made  by  one  or  more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST

It is Grosvenor's  policy to act on each Proxy Request relating to an Immaterial
Proposal  in  accordance  with  such  request  (unless  Grosvenor's   Operations
Committee determines otherwise).

Except as provided in the following two paragraphs and as discussed  below under
"MANAGING  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST," it is  Grosvenor's  general  policy to act on
each Proxy  Request  relating  to a Material  Proposal  in  accordance  with the
recommendation of the Grosvenor  employee who has primary  investment  authority
with respect to the securities in question (the "PRIMARY INVESTMENT PRINCIPAL"),
as long as such action would be  consistent  with the  investment  objective(s),
policies and restrictions of the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

Grosvenor's  Operations  Committee,  after due  consideration,  may  authorize a
favorable  action on a Material  Proposal even though  favorable  action on such
proposal  would not be  consistent  the  investment  objective(s),  policies and
restrictions  of the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  upon such terms and
subject to such  conditions  as the  Operations  Committee  may  determine to be
appropriate under the circumstances.

Any member of Grosvenor's  Investment Committee may object to the recommendation
of a Primary Investment Principal in response to a Proxy Request. In the case of
any such  objection,  the matter shall be referred to the Investment  Committee,
whose decision shall be final and conclusive;  provided, however, that the Chief
Executive Officer or the Operations Committee may veto any action proposed to be
taken by a  Primary  Investment  Principal  or by the  Investment  Committee  in
response to a Proxy Request.

<PAGE>


FACTORS  CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING  WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST

Grosvenor  expects that Proxy  Requests  frequently  will  request  Grosvenor to
approve measures that reduce the rights,  powers and authority,  and/or increase
the duties and obligations,  associated with the security in question  ("ADVERSE
MEASURES").  For example,  it is anticipated that Proxy Requests frequently will
request  Grosvenor to approve  increased  fees and/or less  favorable  liquidity
provisions relating to Portfolio Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest.

Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend  favorable  action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse  Measures as
long as such Primary Investment Principal reasonably believes that continuing to
hold the relevant security has a reasonable  probability of conferring  benefits
on the  relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (e.g.,  continued  access  to a
high-quality  Investment  Manager) that  outweigh the adverse  affect(s) of such
Adverse Measure, considered over the anticipated holding period of such security
in the hands of the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In  furtherance  of  Grosvenor's  goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  interests  of  the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  will not  implement  any  decision  to  respond to a Proxy
Request in a particular manner unless and until a Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer
has implemented certain procedures to: (i) identify whether Grosvenor is subject
to a conflict of interest  in taking  action in response to such Proxy  Request;
(ii) assess the  materiality  of such a conflict;  and (iii)  address a material
conflict  in a manner  designed  to serve  the best  interests  of the  affected
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).  A  conflict  of  interest  ordinarily  will  be
considered material if it can reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of
its  related  persons)  has an  incentive  to respond to the Proxy  Request in a
manner  designed to benefit  Grosvenor (or any such related  person) rather than
the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (even if  there  is no  ostensible
detriment to the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) from responding to such
request  in  that  manner).  All  materiality  determinations  are  based  on an
assessment of the particular facts and circumstances.

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of  interest in taking  action in response to a
Proxy Request but that such  conflict is not material,  he or she shall issue an
instruction  to take action in response to such Proxy Request as provided  above
under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is  subject  to a material  conflict  of  interest  in taking  action in
response to a Proxy Request,  he or she shall, in  consultation  with such other
Grosvenor  personnel  as he  or  she  determines  to be  appropriate  under  the
circumstances,  determine how to address such conflict.  In  determining  how to
address a material conflict of interest,  the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer may
consider the following potential solutions, as well as any other solutions he or
she wishes to consider:

o    disclosing the conflict of interest to the  participant(s)  in the relevant
     Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  and obtaining  their consent (in  accordance
     with the  governing  documents of such Account) to act on the Proxy Request
     as provided  above  under  "DETERMINING  WHAT  ACTION  SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH
     RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."


<PAGE>

o    engaging an  independent  third party to  recommend a response to the Proxy
     Request.

The Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer shall not issue an instruction to take action
in response to the Proxy Request without first  determining  that such action is
in the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

GROSVENOR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P. ("GROSVENOR")

     MANAGEMENT.  The  Fund's  assets are  managed  pursuant  to a  Sub-Advisory
Agreement  by  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor").   Grosvenor
maintains an Investment Committee that is responsible for, among other things:

     o    determining  the  investment   objectives  and  constraints  for  each
          investment  fund or account  that is  managed or advised by  Grosvenor
          (each, a "Grosvenor-Managed  Account"). In the case of the Fund, these
          investment  objectives and  constraints are subject to approval by the
          Fund's Board of Directors.

     o    identifying, evaluating and approving (or disapproving) the investment
          strategies  in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including  the
          Fund, may invest.

     o    identifying,  evaluating and approving (or  disapproving)  third-party
          investment  management  firms  ("Investment   Managers")  that  employ
          investment  strategies  that  have  been  approved  by the  Investment
          Committee.

     o    monitoring investment strategies and Investment Managers.

     Grosvenor's  Chief  Executive  Officer is responsible  for assigning one or
more senior level investment  professionals (each, an "Investment Principal") to
each  Grosvenor-Managed  Account,  including  the  Fund,  whose  function  is to
construct a portfolio  for such  Grosvenor-Managed  Account by using  investment
strategies  and  Investment  Managers that have been approved by the  Investment
Committee  (subject  to  the  investment  objectives  and  constraints  of  such
Grosvenor-Managed Account).

     Grosvenor's  Investment Committee is currently comprised of David B. Small,
David S.  Richter,  and Brian A.  Wolf.  Michael  J.  Sacks,  Grosvenor's  Chief
Executive  Officer,  is not a member of the Investment  Committee,  but has veto
power  over  the  decisions  of  the  Investment   Committee  and  approves  the
allocations to Investment Managers by the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

     The Investment  Committee has assigned David B. Small, David S. Richter and
Brian A. Wolf as the Investment Principals for the Fund.

MICHAEL J. SACKS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Mr. Sacks,  born 1962,  joined Grosvenor in 1990 and, for the past 5+ years, has
served as Grosvenor's  Chief  Executive  Officer.  In addition to his management
responsibilities,  Mr. Sacks is a non-voting  member of  Grosvenor's  Investment
Committee with a formal veto right over the  committee's  operations.  From 1988
through 1990, Mr. Sacks was associated  with Harris  Associates,  L.P. Mr. Sacks
received a B.A. in Economics from Tulane University in 1984 and two degrees from
Northwestern University in 1988: an M.B.A. from the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School
of Management  and a J.D. from the School of Law. He is a member of the Illinois
Bar.

(1)      For  purposes of this  column,  "master-feeder"  structures,  which may
         include multiple "feeder" funds, are counted as one account.
(2)      For purposes of this column, "feeders" into a "master fund" are counted
         as individual accounts where they have performance-based fees.
(3)      Total AUM for each account is  included.  Note,  however,  that in some
         accounts, some investors may not be subject to performance-based fees.

<PAGE>

     COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE.  Mr.  Sacks  and  the  members  of the  Investment
Committee each receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon
the success of the firm. In addition, each holds an equity participation,  which
entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not based upon the performance or
net  asset  value  of the  Fund  or any of the  other  accounts  managed  by the
Investment Committee.

     OWNERSHIP  BY  PORTFOLIO  MANAGERS.  As of  March  31,  2007,  none  of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Fund owns any interests in the Fund.

     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  Grosvenor  is subject to  significant  conflicts of
interest  in  managing  the  business  and  affairs  of the Fund  and the  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts and in making  investment  decisions for them.  Such
conflicts  could  affect  Grosvenor's  objectivity  and the  performance  of the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund. Grosvenor has fiduciary duties
to the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to act in good faith and with fairness in all
its dealings  with them,  and will take such duties into account in dealing with
all actual and potential conflicts of interest.

     Grosvenor and its related persons are currently involved in, and may in the
future become involved in, other business ventures, including: (i) investing in,
entering into fee-, revenue- or profit sharing agreements with, operating and/or
managing other  investment  management or investment  advisory  firms;  and (ii)
managing  and/or  administering  investment  funds and  accounts  in addition to
existing Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  The  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will not
share in the risks or  rewards  of such  other  ventures.  Further,  such  other
ventures will both compete with the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for the time and
attention of Grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional
conflicts of interest or raise other special  considerations.  Grosvenor and its
related  persons,  in  investing  and  trading  for  accounts  (including  their
proprietary  accounts) other than the Fund, may make use of information obtained
by them in the  course of  investing  for the Fund.  Grosvenor  and its  related
persons will have no obligation to compensate  the Fund in any respect for their
receipt of such  information  or to account to the Fund for any  profits  earned
from their use of such information.

     Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  currently  manage or advise  numerous
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  in  addition  to the Fund,  and expect to manage or
advise  additional  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  in the  future.  Certain of the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  have or will have  investment  objectives  that are
identical or substantially  similar to those of the Fund. It is not anticipated,
however, that the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts having identical or
substantially similar investment objectives will have identical or substantially
similar investment  portfolios.  Differing investment portfolios can be expected
to result from several factors, including, without limitation, the following:

          o    different  investment  decisions made by the different  Grosvenor
               portfolio  managers  assigned to the different  Grosvenor-Managed
               Accounts;

<PAGE>

          o    regulatory   and/or  tax  restrictions   that  apply  to  certain
               Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not to others;

          o    investment  constraints  imposed by the  Investment  Managers  of
               Portfolio Funds on certain Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts but not on
               others;

          o    the availability of particular  Portfolio Funds for investment by
               Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others;

          o    different risk/return characteristics  (notwithstanding that such
               Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  generally  have  similar  investment
               objectives);

          o    client-imposed portfolio management restrictions; and

          o    the  amount  of  cash   available  for  investment  by  different
               Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times.

     As a result  of  factors  such as  these,  the  Fund  may have a  different
investment  portfolio  (and, as a result,  different  performance  results) from
other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   even  though  the  Fund  and  such  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.

     The Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may be managed by different
Grosvenor   portfolio   managers   even   though   the  Fund   and  such   other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.  Grosvenor's  portfolio managers are authorized to invest the assets
of the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for which they have investment responsibility
in a wide range of underlying  Portfolio Funds. As a result, it is expected that
the Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will have  different  investment
portfolios   resulting  from  different   investment  decisions  made  by  their
respective  Grosvenor  portfolio  managers,  even  if  they  have  identical  or
substantially  similar  investment  objectives.  Further,  the factors described
above  are  likely  to  result in  different  portfolios  for  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that are managed by the same Grosvenor portfolio managers,  even though
such   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  have  identical  or  substantially  similar
investment objectives.

     Regulatory and/or tax restrictions may prohibit the Fund from participating
in   investment   opportunities   that  are  available  to  one  or  more  other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Similarly, the Investment Managers of the Portfolio
Funds in which the Fund wishes to invest may impose  investment  restrictions on
the Fund but not on other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Such restrictions could
render the Fund  ineligible to invest,  in whole or in part, in a Portfolio Fund
in which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are free to invest, to the
possible detriment of the Fund.

     Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
may place  assets  under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure  investment
advisory or investment management services from, any Investment Manager directly
or indirectly used by one or more other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including
the Fund.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  Grosvenor,  its
related  persons and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  may invest in, or
withdraw investments from, a Portfolio Fund in which the Fund and/or one or more
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are invested, from which they are withdrawing
their investments or in which they are not invested.

     In  certain  instances,  Grosvenor  may be  required  to  allocate  limited
investment  opportunities  in  Portfolio  Funds  among  Grosvenor,  its  related
persons, the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor has developed
policies and procedures for allocating  limited  investment  opportunities  in a
manner that it believes to be equitable to all Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.


<PAGE>

     Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
that place  assets under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure  investment
advisory or investment management services from, any Investment Manager directly
or  indirectly  used by the  Fund  and/or  one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts may do so on terms  (including  terms  relating to fees and  liquidity)
that are more  advantageous than those applicable to the investments made by the
Fund  and/or  such  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  with  such  Investment
Manager. To the extent that Grosvenor or its related persons invest with a given
Investment  Manager on terms that are more  advantageous than those on which the
Fund  and/or  one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  invest  with such
Investment  Manager,  Grosvenor and its related persons may have an incentive to
maintain or increase the investment by the Fund and such other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts with such  Investment  Manager in order to obtain and/or  maintain such
advantageous terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and its related persons.

     Grosvenor and its related  persons may from time to time invest,  for their
respective  proprietary  accounts,  in early-stage  Portfolio  Funds  (including
Non-Advised  Funds,  as  described  below),  at times when  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds  are not  appropriate  for the Fund or other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.  If Grosvenor should  subsequently  determine,  in accordance with its
then-current  criteria  applicable to the  selection of Portfolio  Funds for the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that  such  a  Portfolio  Fund  is an  appropriate
investment for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and its related persons
will not be  required  to  restructure  the terms on which  they  invest in such
Portfolio Fund in order to make  investments in such Portfolio Fund available to
the Fund if, for  regulatory or other  reasons,  the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded  from  investing in such Portfolio
Fund in the absence of such restructuring.

     Grosvenor and its related  persons may from time to time invest,  for their
respective   proprietary   accounts,   in  certain  investment  funds  that  are
administered,  but not advised, by Grosvenor (the "NON-ADVISED  FUNDS") and from
which  they  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees.  In  many  cases,  such
investments may be made at times when  investments in the Non-Advised  Funds are
not appropriate for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. If Grosvenor should subsequently
determine,  in  accordance  with its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the
selection of Portfolio  Funds for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that such a
Non-Advised  Fund  is  an  appropriate   investment  for  the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,   Grosvenor   may   cause   the  Fund   and/or   one  or  more   other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  to invest  in such  Non-Advised  Fund  even  though
Grosvenor  continues  to  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees  from  such
Non-Advised Fund. Moreover,  Grosvenor will not be required to reduce, eliminate
or  restructure  the  administrative  or  similar  fees it  receives  from  such
Non-Advised Fund in order to make investments in such Non-Advised Fund available
to the Fund if, for regulatory or other reasons, the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded from investing in such Non-Advised
Fund in the absence of such fee reduction, elimination or restructuring.

     A Grosvenor  portfolio manager might have an incentive to favor one or more
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  over the Fund  (for  example,  with  regard  to the
selection  of  Portfolio  Funds  for  those  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  or the
allocation  of  investment  opportunities  in Portfolio  Funds that have limited
investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Accounts might pay
Grosvenor  more  for its  services  than  the  Fund or  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that invest in the Fund.  Similarly,  a Grosvenor portfolio manager may
have an incentive to favor one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over the Fund
if  such  portfolio  manager  has  a  personal   investment  in  such  "favored"
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  No  assurance  can be given that (i) the Fund will
participate in all investment opportunities in which other client or proprietary
accounts of  Grosvenor  and its related  persons  participate,  (ii)  particular
investment   opportunities  allocated  to  client  or  proprietary  accounts  of
Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  other  than the Fund  will not  outperform
investment  opportunities  allocated to the Fund,  or (iii) the Fund, on the one
hand, and other similarly-situated  client and proprietary accounts of Grosvenor
and its  related  persons,  on the other  hand,  will  receive  equal or similar
treatment.

     Different participants in the same Grosvenor-Managed Account (including the
Fund), as well as certain other persons (including persons who may have a direct
or indirect  interest in Grosvenor and persons who were previously,  but who are
not currently,  associated  with  Grosvenor),  receive  reporting  packages from
Grosvenor  that  differ  in  form,  substance,   timing  and/or  frequency.   In
particular,  certain  reporting  packages  may include  information  relating to
Portfolio  Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund,
invest (or in which they are contemplating an investment).  Grosvenor ordinarily
does not place  restrictions  on a recipient's  use of such  information,  and a
recipient  could use such  information to invest  directly in Portfolio Funds in
which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Fund, invest (or in which
they are  contemplating  an  investment),  potentially in  competition  with the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Fund.

<PAGE>


     Certain of the Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests may hold notes or
other  securities  issued from time to time by  Grosvenor,  and Grosvenor may be
aware that such Portfolio Funds do so. Grosvenor does not believe, however, that
either of the foregoing  circumstances will in any respect influence Grosvenor's
selection of Portfolio Funds.

     The Investment  Managers are likely to be subject to many of the same types
of conflict  of  interest  to which  Grosvenor  is  subject.  For  example,  the
Investment  Managers may be involved in other business  ventures,  including the
management  and/or  administration  of other investment funds and accounts whose
investment  objectives  are identical or  substantially  similar to those of the
Portfolio  Funds.  Neither  the  Fund nor the Fund  will  share in the  risks or
rewards of such other  ventures.  In addition,  such other ventures will compete
with the  relevant  Portfolio  Funds for the time and  attention of the relevant
Investment Managers,  and might create additional conflicts of interest or raise
other special considerations.

     The  Investment  Managers  have  responsibility  for  investing  the  funds
allocated to them. The Investment Managers also manage other accounts (including
other  accounts in which they may have an interest)  and may have  financial and
other  incentives to favor such  accounts over the Portfolio  Funds in which the
Fund invests.  In investing on behalf of other clients, as well as the Portfolio
Funds in which the Fund invests,  the  Investment  Managers must allocate  their
resources, as well as limited market opportunities.  Doing so could increase the
level of competition  for the same trades that  otherwise  might be made for the
Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests,  including  the  priorities of order
entry,  as well as  make it  difficult  or  impossible  to take or  liquidate  a
particular position at a price indicated by an Investment Manager's strategy.

     In addition,  in connection  with investing and trading for other accounts,
including their proprietary  accounts,  the Investment  Managers may make use of
information  obtained  by them in the course of  investing  and  trading for the
Portfolio Funds.  They will have no obligation to compensate the Portfolio Funds
in any respect for their receipt of such  information  or to account to any such
Portfolio Fund for any profits earned from their use of such information.

     The  Investment  Managers  and their  principals,  in  managing  investment
accounts other than the Portfolio Funds,  may employ trading  methods,  policies
and  strategies  which  differ  from those  which they  employ on behalf of such
Portfolio  Funds.  Therefore,  the  results  of the Fund's  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds may differ from the results of other  accounts  managed by such
Investment Managers.

     The Investment Managers value the illiquid, longer-term investments held by
their  Portfolio  Funds in a variety of different  ways,  and have  considerable
discretion in doing so. The  Investment  Managers have a conflict of interest in
arriving  at such  valuations,  which  affect  both  the  performance  of  their
Portfolio  Funds  and  the  advisory  compensation  received  by the  Investment
Managers.

     The Investment  Managers have a conflict of interest in allocating  capital
to  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments.  While such  positions  may hold
significant  profit  potential  (and,  therefore,   the  potential  to  generate
substantial  incentive  compensation),  they can create  material  valuation and
illiquidity risks for investors. In addition, performance fees may be calculated
separately  in  respect  of  certain  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments
irrespective of the overall performance of a Portfolio Fund.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material  changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may  recommend  nominees to the  registrant's  board of  directors,  where those
changes were  implemented  after the  registrant  last  provided  disclosure  in
response to the  requirements  of Item  407(c)(2)(iv)  of Regulation S-K (17 CFR
229.407) (as required by Item  22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR  240.14a-101)),
or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          based on their evaluation of the registrant's  disclosure controls and
          procedures  as of a date within 90 days of the filing of this  report,
          have  concluded  that such  controls  and  procedures  are  adequately
          designed to ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed by the
          registrant  in Form  N-CSR  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the
          registrant's management, including the principal executive officer and
          principal  financial officer, or persons performing similar functions,
          as  appropriate   to  allow  timely   decisions   regarding   required
          disclosure.

     (b)  There  was  no  change  in  the  registrant's  internal  control  over
          financial  reporting (as defined in Rule  30a-3(d)  under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITY            Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
                                Item 2 of Form N-CSR

- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT
- ----------------------

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified shareholder reports, requires a registered
management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the investment company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such a code of ethics, why
it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of
ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Ethics, which sets
forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

FUND LEVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
- ----------------------------------

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer or
Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
          other public communications made by the Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
<PAGE>

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or apparent
conflicts of interest.

II. ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

     The Board has designated an individual to be primarily responsible for the
administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the absence of the Code
Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
temporary basis.

     The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief legal
officer (the "CLO") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
promulgated thereunder as the Fund's CLO. The CLO of the Fund shall assist the
Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code Officer, in
consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and
has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

     Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern certain
conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is consistent
with such programs and procedures falls outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser, administrator,
principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
(each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes

<PAGE>

that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or for both), be
involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the Primary Service Providers and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationships between the Fund and the Primary Service Providers and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with
applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed
to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of
the Fund that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or
more other investment companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of
the Fund covered by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those
other investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers
acting in such capacities for such other investment companies.

     This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to provisions
in the 1940 Act and Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
          relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
          financial reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,
          for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

     o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
          or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to
          trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
          transactions; and

     o    report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate) known
          affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
          interest with respect to the Fund.

     If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict of
interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or his
or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered Officer,
including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his or her
responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary Service
Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code Officer, the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members, as
appropriate.

<PAGE>

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and which the
Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or other
appropriate person include:

     o    service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
          service as a public official;

     o    the receipt of a non-de minimis gift when the gift is in relation to
          doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

     o    the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
          current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
          business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
          place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     o    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
          with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Primary
          Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
          transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
          portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than
          an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     o    to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
          generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and
          financial operations of the Fund;

     o    to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
          misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel, legal
          counsel to the Independent Board Members and auditors, and to
          governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
          Service Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
          timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
          communications made by the Fund; and
<PAGE>

     o    to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility, promote
          compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer, acknowledge
          in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has received, read and
          understands the Code, using the form attached as Appendix I hereto;

     o    annually thereafter acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board that he
          or she has received and read the Code and believes that he or she has
          complied with the requirements of the Code, using the form attached as
          Appendix II hereto;

     o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any violation,
          or of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be or result in a
          violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     The Fund will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o    The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
          investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

     o    If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
          reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

     o    Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
          believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or the
          CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

     o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Fund's Board, which will
          consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to the appropriate personnel of the Fund's Primary
          Service Providers or their boards; a recommendation to censure,
          suspend or dismiss the Covered Officer; or referral of the matter to
          the appropriate authorities for civil action or criminal prosecution;
<PAGE>

     o    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers,
          as appropriate; and

     o    This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly any
violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for the
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered management investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary Service Providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent
that they conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Fund's and its
Adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act and the more detailed policies and procedures of the Primary Service
Providers as set forth in their respect Compliance Manuals are separate
requirements applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

ratified by the Fund's Board, including a majority of the Independent Board
Members.

be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.

reports and records shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's
Board, the Covered Officers, the Code Officer, the CLO, the Fund's Primary
Service Providers and their affiliates, and outside audit firms, legal counsel
to the Fund and legal counsel to the Independent Board Members and to the
Primary Service Providers and their affiliates.

IX.  RECORDKEEPING

     The Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an easily
accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the Audit
Committee or the Board: (i) that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver
to this Code; and (ii) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions
imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the approval or
action taken by the Audit Committee and/or Board.

         The CLO is responsible for maintaining (i) a current list of the Fund's
Covered

<PAGE>

Officers and (ii) records of all activities related to this Policy, including
those records required to be maintained by the Fund pursuant to the preceding
paragraph.


X.   INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

for administration of this Policy and for adopting specific procedures to ensure
