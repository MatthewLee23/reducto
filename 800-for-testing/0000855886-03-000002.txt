Dear Fellow Shareholders,

After a strong start to 2003, the stock market succumbed to the pressures of a
weak economy, rising oil prices, concerns about corporate earnings and
uncertainties about the war in Iraq. The tide turned in April, when the war
ended and first-quarter corporate earnings came in better than expected. As a
result, the major indexes all gained some ground year to date through April 30,
2003, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average returning 2.50%, the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index returning 4.82% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index up
9.64%. Bonds, which have outperformed stocks for the last three years, continued
their upward trend this year, as investors still sought their relative safety.

After the jarring stock market losses of the last three years, it's a relief for
investors to be reminded that the market is indeed cyclical, and does eventually
move up - not just down. But while the stock market has been clawing its way
back, the ride has been extremely volatile. Uncertainty still abounds about the
strength of the economy, geopolitical issues, corporate governance problems,
rising unemployment and the sustainability of corporate earnings growth. And
despite rallies late last year and in April, many investors are still so bruised
and skeptical that they have remained on the sidelines. Even though the
statistics suggest we might be emerging from this long, difficult bear market,
we're not quite ready to call it history.

While no one can predict when this bear market cycle will turn, investors can
take charge of how they maneuver through such uncertain times. First, take a
look at how your portfolio is allocated among stocks, bonds and cash to make
sure it's in the proper balance. Work with your investment professional, who
knows your long-term goals and can help keep you on the right track, rather than
being lured by today's stars, which could wind up tomorrow's laggards. And as
always, keep a long-term investment horizon. We believe this offers the best way
for you to survive the tough times and reach your investment objectives.

Sincerely,


/s/Maureen R. Ford

John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II

MANAGERS' REPORT

Preferred  stocks  - which  make up the  bulk of John  Hancock  Patriot  Premium
Dividend Fund II - performed  reasonably  well during the six months ended April
30, 2003. Falling interest rates, punctuated by a surprise half-percentage-point
rate cut by the Federal  Reserve  Board in November  2002,  provided some of the
fuel powering  preferred  stocks'  gains.  Because they pay dividends at a fixed
rate, like the interest on a bond,  preferred stocks tend to rally when interest
rates drop,  just as bonds do.  Another  factor that helped was stronger  demand
from income-seeking  investors looking for significantly higher yields than what
companies paid on their bonds and common stocks. Many preferred stocks continued
to yield  between 7% and 9%,  outstripping  by a fairly  wide  margin the yields
available on Treasury and  corporate  bonds,  as well as the  dividends  paid on
common stocks. Demand also strengthened in response to President Bush's proposed
dividend tax-cut package,  which is designed to eliminate taxes that individuals
pay on most stock  dividends.  Even though the proposal had not been approved by
Congress by the end of April 2003, the  anticipation  that at least some form of
dividend tax relief  ultimately would be adopted was enough for investors to bid
preferred  stock prices  higher.  And even though the types of preferred  stocks
that are the Fund's focus - those that pay  dividends in pretax  dollars - won't
benefit from tax relief,  their prices tended to be lifted by the development as
well.

"Preferred  stocks...performed reasonably well during the six months ended April
30, 2003."

Utility  common  stocks - the Fund's other primary area of emphasis - were still
mired in the  remnants  of the Enron  debacle  when the  period  began and their
performance was quite  disappointing.  But conditions  began to improve in early
2003, and by mid-February,  utility stocks staged a heartening rally through the
end of the period. Some of the improvement was

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

due to investors' recognition that the sector had become undervalued relative to
the market as a whole and relative to its historic value.  Also aiding the group
was the dividend tax-relief proposal.  Through the years, utilities have offered
consistently  high dividends and are poised to benefit if tax relief is enacted.
Finally, the utility companies did their part to boost confidence. They began to
face  reality,  cleaning up their balance  sheets and ridding  themselves of the
types of  unregulated  subsidiaries  - such as energy trading - that caused them
the most pain in the post-Enron environment.

FUND PERFORMANCE

For the six months ended April 30, 2003, John Hancock  Patriot Premium  Dividend
Fund II returned 7.74% at net asset value. By comparison, the average income and
preferred stock  closed-end fund returned 13.01%,  according to Lipper,  Inc. We
believe  the Fund's  relative  underperformance  versus its peers was due to the
fact that we are unable to buy the below-investment-grade, or junk, credits that
had a big rally off of very low bases. In the same period, the Dow Jones Utility
Average,  which tracks the performance of 15 electric and natural gas utilities,
returned  16.19%,  surpassing  the  Fund's  result  because it  includes  deeply
distressed  energy  merchants,  which  rebounded off of low bases. We own few to
none of these companies.

"...the run-up in oil prices... helped boost our preferred- stock holdings whose
issuers are involved in the production and distribution of oil and natural gas."

LEADERS AND LAGGARDS

The run-up in oil prices - which also helped pump up natural gas prices - helped
boost our preferred-stock holdings whose issuers are involved in the production
and distribution of oil and natural gas. Energy prices climbed steadily in
response to concerns about disrupted oil supplies stemming from the oil strike


                                                                               3

in Venezuela, the escalation of tensions in the Middle East and, ultimately, the
U.S.-led war on Iraq. Some standout holdings included Anadarko Petroleum, Apache
Corp. and Devon Energy.

Despite the utility common stock sector's overall  disappointing returns for the
period,  we did benefit from our continued  emphasis on companies  that transmit
and  distribute   electricity  located  in  states  with  favorable   regulatory
environments,  and from our  avoidance  of companies  with large energy  trading
operations.  Two  good  examples  were  NSTAR  and  CH  Energy,  both  of  which
outperformed the overall utility group during the period.

Our single biggest disappointment during the period was El Paso Tennessee
Pipeline Co. That stock came under pressure when a judge ruled that the company
had manipulated pipeline capacity during the 2001 California power crisis. In
late March, the company settled those allegations out of court. In our view,
this was a positive, albeit costly, development because it allows the company to
put some lingering problems behind it and move ahead with its business plan. We
also like the fact that the company has made a series of other positive moves,
including selling assets, securing new bank financings and exiting energy
trading.

OUTLOOK

Our outlook calls for continued  lackluster  economic  growth,  which we believe
will preclude the need for interest-rate  hikes for the foreseeable  future. Low
interest rates should continue to prompt strong demand for preferred  stocks. If
some form of dividend tax relief is enacted by Congress,  we believe that,  too,
could help preferreds.  As for utility common stocks, we're encouraged that many
companies  spent the last year  reducing  debt,  which could  foster more stable
rating-agency  outlooks  and,  potentially,  a continued  rebound in their stock
prices.  Furthermore,  utility common stocks remain attractively valued relative
to the stock market overall. And given the  colder-than-normal  winter, there is
reason to believe utilities'  year-over-year earnings comparisons could improve.
Further positives for the group include the potential  enactment of dividend tax
relief and the possible  elimination of an  anachronistic  law limiting  utility
mergers.

"Low  interest  rates  should  continue to prompt  strong  demand for  preferred
stocks."

NOTES TO
STATEMENTS

Unaudited


NOTE A
Accounting policies

John Hancock Patriot Premium Dividend Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified
closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

Significant accounting policies of the Fund are as follows:

Valuation of investments
Securities in the Fund's portfolio are valued on the basis of market quotations,
valuations  provided  by  independent  pricing  services  or at  fair  value  as
determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Trustees.
Short-term  debt  investments  maturing  within 60 days are valued at  amortized
cost, which  approximates  market value. The Fund determines the net asset value
of the common shares each business day.

Investment transactions
Investment  transactions  are  recorded  as of the  date  of  purchase,  sale or
maturity.  Net realized gains and losses on sales of investments  are determined
on the identified cost basis.

Expenses
The majority of the expenses are directly identifiable to an individual fund.
Expenses that are not readily identifiable to a specific fund will be allocated
in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into consideration, among other
things, the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the funds.

Federal income taxes
The Fund qualifies as a "regulated investment company" by complying with the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and will not be subject to
federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. For federal income tax
purposes, the Fund has $533,811 of a capital loss carryforward available, to the
extent provided by regulations, to offset future net realized capital gains. To
the extent that such carryforward is used by the Fund, no capital gain
distributions will be made. The entire loss carryforward expires October 31,
2010.



                                                                              13
<PAGE>


Dividends, interest and distributions
Dividend income on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend date or,
in the case of some foreign securities, on the date thereafter when the Fund
identifies the dividend. Interest income on investment securities is recorded on
the accrual basis. Foreign income may be subject to foreign withholding taxes,
which are accrued as applicable.

The Fund records distributions to common and preferred shareholders from net
investment income and realized gains on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
common shareholders, on a tax basis, are determined in conformity with income
tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Distributions in excess of tax basis earnings
and profits, if any, are reported in the Fund's financial statements as a return
of capital.

Use of estimates
The preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, incorporates
estimates made by management in determining the reported amount of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Fund. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

NOTE B
Management fee and transactions with affiliates and others
The Fund has an investment management contract with John Hancock Advisers, LLC
(the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Berkeley Financial Group, LLC.
Under the investment management contract, the Fund pays a monthly management fee
to the Adviser at an annual rate of 0.50% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets and the value attributable to the DARTS, plus 5.00% of the Fund's weekly
gross income. The Adviser's total fee is limited to a maximum amount equal to
1.00% annually of the Fund's average weekly net assets and the value
attributable to the DARTS. For the period ended April 30, 2003, the advisory fee
incurred did not exceed the maximum advisory fee allowed.

The Fund has an administrative agreement with the Adviser under which the
Adviser oversees the custodial, auditing, valuation, accounting, legal, stock
transfer and dividend disbursing services and maintains Fund communications with
the shareholders. The Fund pays the Adviser a monthly administration fee at an

Ms.  Maureen R. Ford and Mr. John M. DeCiccio are directors  and/or  officers of
the  Adviser  and/or  its  affiliates,  as well as  Trustees  of the  Fund.  The
compensation  of  unaffiliated  Trustees is borne by the Fund. The  unaffiliated
Trustees may elect to defer for tax purposes their receipt of this  compensation
under the John Hancock Group of Funds Deferred Compensation Plan. The Fund makes
investments into other John Hancock funds, as applicable, to cover its liability
for  the  deferred  compensation.  Investments  to  cover  the  Fund's  deferred
compensation  liability are recorded on the Fund's books as an other asset.  The
deferred compensation liability and the related other asset are always equal and
are marked to market on a periodic  basis to  reflect  any income  earned by the
investments as well as any unrealized gains or losses. The Deferred Compensation
Plan investments had no impact on the operations of the Fund.

Dutch Auction Rate Transferable  Securities preferred shares Series A and Series
B

The Fund issued Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities preferred shares
("DARTS"), 598 shares of Series A and 598 shares of Series B, in a public
offering. The underwriting discount was recorded as a reduction of the capital
of common shares. During the year ended October 31, 1990, the Fund retired 98
shares of DARTS from both Series A and Series B.

Dividends on the DARTS,  which accrue daily,  are  cumulative at a rate that was
established  at the  offering  of the  DARTS  and has been  reset  every 49 days
thereafter by an auction.  Dividend rates on DARTS Series A ranged from 1.14% to
1.76% and on Series B from 1.15% to 1.85%,  during the  period  ended  April 30,
2003.  Accrued  dividends  on DARTS  are  included  in the value of DARTS on the
Fund's statement of assets and liabilities.

The DARTS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price equal
to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
payment date. The DARTS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption
price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the
Fund is in default on its asset coverage requirements with respect to the DARTS,
as defined in the Funds' by-laws. If the dividends on the DARTS shall remain
unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the
DARTS, as a class, have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees.
In general, the holders of the DARTS and the common shareholders have equal
voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the DARTS, as a
class, vote to elect two members of the Board of Trustees, and separate class
votes are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of
the DARTS and common shares.

Investment
transactions

Purchases and proceeds from sales and maturities of securities, other than
short-term securities and obligations of the U.S. government, during the period
ended April 30, 2003, aggregated none and $6,581,098, respectively.

The  cost  of  investments  owned  on  April  30,  2003,   including  short-term
investments, for federal income tax purposes was $271,600,675.  Gross unrealized
appreciation  and  depreciation  of  investments   aggregated   $15,950,454  and
$35,083,759, respectively, resulting in net

unrealized  depreciation of $19,133,305.  The difference  between book basis and
tax basis net unrealized  depreciation of investments is attributable  primarily
to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales.

INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE
AND POLICY

The Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income consistent
with modest growth of capital for holders of its common shares of beneficial
interest. The Fund will pursue its objective by investing in a diversified
portfolio of dividend paying preferred and common stocks.

The Fund's  non-fundamental  investment  policy,  with respect to the quality of
ratings  of its  portfolio  investments,  was  changed  by a vote of the  Fund's
Trustees on September 13, 1994. The new policy,  which became effective  October
15, 1994,  stipulates  that preferred  stocks and debt  obligations in which the
Fund will invest will be rated  investment-grade (at least "BBB" by S&P or "Baa"
by Moody's) at the time of investment or will be preferred  stocks of issuers of
investment   grade   senior   debt,   some  of  which   may   have   speculative
characteristics,  or, if not rated, will be of comparable  quality as determined
by the Adviser.  The Fund will invest in common  stocks of issuers  whose senior
debt is rated  investment  grade or, in the case of  issuers  that have no rated
senior debt outstanding, whose senior debt is considered by the Adviser to be of
comparable quality.  This policy supersedes the requirement that at least 80% of
the Fund's total assets consist of preferred stocks and debt  obligations  rated
"A" or higher and dividend  paying  common stocks whose issuers have senior debt
rated "A" or higher.

On November 20, 2001,  the Fund's  Trustees  approved the  following  investment
policy investment restriction change,  effective December 15, 2001. Under normal
circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in dividend-paying
securities.  The "Assets" are defined as net assets  including  the  liquidation
preference amount of the DARTS plus borrowings for investment purposes. The Fund
will  notify  shareholders  at least 60 days  prior  to any  change  in this 80%
investment policy.

In November 2002, the Board of Trustees adopted several amendments to the Fund's
by-laws,  including  provisions relating to the calling of a special meeting and
requiring advance notice of shareholder  proposals or nominees for Trustee.  The
advance notice provisions in the by-laws require shareholders to notify the Fund
in writing of any proposal  which they intend to present at an annual meeting of
shareholders,  including any  nominations  for Trustee,  between 90 and 120 days
prior to the first  anniversary of the mailing date of the notice from the prior
year's annual  meeting of  shareholders.  The  notification  must be in the form
prescribed by the by-laws.  The advance notice  provisions  provide the Fund and
its  Trustees  with the  opportunity  to  thoughtfully  consider and address the
matters  proposed  before the Fund  prepares  and mails its proxy  statement  to
shareholders.  Other amendments set forth the procedures, which must be followed
in order for a shareholder  to call a special  meeting of  shareholders.  Please
contact the Secretary of the Fund for additional  information  about the advance
notice requirements or the other amendments to the by-laws.

DIVIDEND
REINVESTMENT PLAN
The Fund offers its shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"),
which offers the opportunity to earn compounded yields. Each holder of common
shares may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
reinvested by Mellon Investor Services, as plan agent for the common
shareholders (the "Plan Agent"). Holders of common shares who do not elect to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash, paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the common shares are held


                                                                              17
<PAGE>



in street or other nominee name, then to the nominee) by the Plan Agent, as
dividend disbursing agent.

Shareholders may join the Plan by filling out and mailing an authorization card,
by notifying  the Plan Agent by  telephone,  or by visiting the Plan Agent's Web
site at  www.melloninvestor.com.  Shareholders  must  indicate  an  election  to
reinvest  all or a portion of dividend  payments.  If received in proper form by
the Plan Agent  before the  record  date of a  dividend,  the  election  will be
effective   with  respect  to  all  dividends   paid  after  such  record  date.
Shareholders  whose  shares are held in the name of a broker or  nominee  should
contact the broker or nominee to determine  whether and how they may participate
in the Plan.

If the Fund  declares a  dividend  payable  either in common  shares or in cash,
nonparticipants  will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the
equivalent  in common  shares.  If the market price of the common  shares on the
payment  date of the  dividend  is equal to or exceeds  their net asset value as
determined on the payment date,  participants  will be issued common shares (out
of authorized  but unissued  shares) at a value equal to the higher of net asset
value or 95% of the market  price.  If the net asset  value  exceeds  the market
price of the common shares at such time, or if the Board of Trustees  declares a
dividend  payable  only in  cash,  the  Plan  Agent  will,  as  agent  for  Plan
participants,  buy shares in the open market,  on the New York Stock Exchange or
elsewhere,  for the participant's accounts. Such purchases will be made promptly
after the payable date for such  dividend  and, in any event,  prior to the next
ex-dividend date after such date,  except where necessary to comply with federal
securities  laws.  If, before the Plan Agent has completed  its  purchases,  the
market price exceeds the net asset value of the common  shares,  the average per
share  purchase  price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset  value of
the common  shares,  resulting  in the  acquisition  of fewer shares than if the
dividend had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

Each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred
with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of dividends and distributions. In each case, the cost per share of
the shares purchased for each participant's account will be the average cost,
including brokerage commissions, of any shares purchased on the open market plus
the cost of any shares issued by the Fund. There will be no brokerage charges
with respect to common shares issued directly by the Fund. There are no other
charges to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gain distributions.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan at any time by contacting
the Plan Agent by telephone, in writing or by visiting the Plan Agent's Web site
at www.melloninvestor.com. Such withdrawal will be effective immediately if
received not less than ten days prior to a dividend record date; otherwise, it
will be effective for all subsequent dividend record dates. When a participant
withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of the Plan, as provided below,
certificates for whole common shares credited to his or her account under the
Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any fraction of a share
credited to such account.

The Plan Agent  maintains each  shareholder's  account in the Plan and furnishes
monthly written  confirmations  of all  transactions in the accounts,  including
information  needed by the shareholders  for personal and tax records.  The Plan
Agent  will hold  common  shares in the  account  of each  Plan  participant  in
noncertificated form in the name of the participant.  Proxy material relating to
the shareholder's meetings of the Fund will include those shares purchased as


18
<PAGE>


well as shares held pursuant to the Plan.

The reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve participants of
any  federal  income tax that may be payable or  required to be withheld on such
dividends  or  distributions.  Participants  under  the Plan  will  receive  tax
information  annually.  The amount of dividend to be reported on 1099-DIV should
be (1) in the case of shares  issued by the Fund,  the fair market value of such
shares on the dividend  payment date and (2) in the case of shares  purchased by
the Plan Agent in the open market,  the amount of cash used by the Plan Agent to
purchase  shares in the open market,  including the amount of cash  allocated to
brokerage commissions paid on such purchases.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change sent to
all shareholders of the Fund at least 90 days before the record date for the
dividend or distribution. The Plan may be amended or terminated by the Plan
Agent after at least 90 days' written notice to all shareholders of the Fund.
All correspondence or additional information concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Plan Agent, Mellon Bank, N.A., c/o Mellon Investor Services,
P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938 (telephone 1-800-852-0218).
