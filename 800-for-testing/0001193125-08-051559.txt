                                                               February 1, 2008

Dear Fellow ZTR Shareholder:

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 2.56% for the
quarter ended December 31, 2007, including $0.126 in reinvested distributions.
During the same period, the Fund's Composite Index gained 0.20%, including
reinvested dividends. The Fund's overall exposure to the bond and equity
markets for the quarter was approximately 88%. As previously announced, the
Fund's distribution for the quarter was $0.041, payable on January 10, 2008 to
shareholders of record on December 31, 2007.

   For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund's net asset value increased
7.93%, including $0.503 in reinvested distributions. Year-to-date taxable
distributions represent 28.1% from net investment income, 31.3% from ordinary
gains, and 40.6% from return of capital. During the same period, the Fund's
Composite Index gained 6.49%, including reinvested dividends. The Fund's
overall exposure to the bond and equity markets for the year was approximately
92%.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.

                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

   The Fund's bond exposure on December 31, 2007 was 47%, with average duration
(a measure of interest rate sensitivity) of 5.0 years. This compares with bond
exposure of 48%, with average duration of 5.5 years, on September 30, 2007. If
we were fully invested, 50% of our portfolio would be in bonds and 50% in
stocks. Consequently, at 47%, we are at about 94% of a full position (47%/50%).

   The U.S. Treasury bond market marched in different directions during the
first and second six months of 2007. The first half generally saw higher yields
and poor bond market performance (bond prices move in an opposite direction
from yields). Reversing course, the bond market staged a significant
second-half rally generated by the housing implosion, the subprime mortgage
meltdown and concerns about a possible recession.

   With the exception of inflation data, bond-friendly economic news helped
Treasuries surge, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling from a high
of 5.30% in mid-June to finish the year at 4.02%. The bond market's volatile
year reflected the weakness in jobs, retail sales, housing starts and other
economically-sensitive data. On balance, yields on Treasury bonds seemed to be
driven mostly by the softening economic outlook rather than by worries about
inflation. By the year-end, the Fed had cut the federal funds rate to 4.25%.
Anticipating further easing, Treasury bonds are reacting with lower rates.

   During 2007, we made several adjustments in our bond portfolio, moving at
times from a high duration to a more neutral stance. Overall, our results were
favorable. Considering only the bond performance of the Fund, we outperformed
the Lipper Government Fund benchmark. Our current


 Managed Distribution Plan: The Fund has a policy to distribute 10% of its net
 asset value annually. Please see the inside back cover for more details.

bond model is slightly positive. However, given the recent volatility endured
by bond investors, we remain cautious and flexible, as always.

   Our exposure to U.S. common stock was 40% on December 31, 2007 compared with
48% on September 30, 2007. At this level, we are at about 80% of a full
position (40%/50%).

   Featuring wild swings in stock prices, the fourth quarter of 2007 was one
for the financial history books. On November 16, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average plummeted 237.44 points, taking it 10% below its October 9, 2007,
record high close of 14,164.53, a traditional definition of a correction. It
was a very short correction. Three days later, on November 28, the Dow soared
331.01 points, its biggest percentage gain in more than four years. That day
also marked the fifth straight day of 100-point- plus moves, up or down, for
the Dow.

   Earlier, three days of losses culminating on November 9 together represented
the worst percentage decline in five years. After this whipsaw quarter, all the
major indexes lost ground for the final three months of the year. The Dow was
off 4.5%/1/, the S&P 500 Index was down 3.8%/1/ and the NASDAQ Composite Index
fell 3.0%/1/. However, when the roller-coaster finally came to a halt on
December 31, the Dow closed 6.4% higher for the year. The S&P 500 gained
3.5%/1/ and the NASDAQ climbed 9.8%/1/, its best annual showing since 2003.

   For the fifth consecutive year, the world stock markets outperformed the
U.S. Excluding the U.S., the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose nearly 12%/1/ in
2007, with the gains mostly in the emerging and developing nations. China
soared 97% and Brazil, India, Indonesia and Turkey all scored over 40%. In
England, the FTSE increased only 3.8%/1/ while Japan's NIKKEI dropped 11%/1/.

   Most of the domestic market troubles centered around the widening housing
slump and the slipover of its problematic subprime mortgage-backed securities
into the broader financial markets, creating a credit crunch. That one-two
punch had a huge impact. Its repercussions spread to the credit card companies,
retailers and other sectors of the economy. It hit earnings hard and caused
stocks to tumble.

   The housing situation remains a mess. Marking the eighth consecutive monthly
decline, construction of new homes dropped 3.7% in November, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million units the lowest since 1991, according to
the Commerce Department. Indicating a further decline, new building permits
fell 1.5% in November, down 25% from a year earlier.

   Because foreclosures are spreading in the housing market, large financial
institutions have taken multi-billion dollar writedowns on their portfolios of
subprime mortgages and their various derivatives. To balance their books,
financial companies have cut back on their lending practices and received huge
cash transfusions from foreign sources. The tightness in the credit markets is
damaging the overall economy. At this writing, it is hard to see any light in
the housing and credit tunnels.

   With the economy wielding down and inflation heating up, the Fed is between
a rock and a hard place. If it continues to cut rates, it will only help the
banks and the economy at the margin in the short term. If it cuts too much, it
can weaken the dollar and exacerbate inflation.

   Citing the "deterioration in financial world markets," the Fed cut its
benchmark short-term interest rate in December by 25 basis points to 4.25%.
Since the credit crunch erupted in August, the Fed has reduced the federal
funds rate by a full percentage point. Explaining its action, the Fed pointed
to "the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in
business and consumer spending." The Fed also noted that "elevated energy and
commodity prices among other factors may put upward pressure on inflation."
Stating that it would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully, the
Fed


                                      2

<PAGE>


promised that it "will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable
economic growth."

   Reflecting the weaker economy, the Institute for Supply Management reported
that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 47.7 in December from 50.8 in
November, its lowest reading since April 2003. A score below 50 indicates
industrial contraction. Stoking the fear of inflation, consumer prices rose
0.8% in November, the biggest monthly gain in two years and 4.3% above a year
ago. Producer prices jumped 3.2% in November, bringing the increase for the
past 12 months to 7.7%. These parallel moves have given investors concern about
stagflation, characterized by a slowing economy and rising inflation, bringing
worries about a possible recession.

   A bright spot in the economy is the rise in U.S. exports. Helped by the weak
dollar, exports in October rose for the eighth consecutive month to a record
$141.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported. From August through October,
U.S. exports spurted 9.6% while imports inched up only 1.1%. Meanwhile, the
dollar ended the year 9.6% lower against the euro and 6.4% below the Japanese
yen, according to the Fed. Calculated against a group of 20 currencies, the
dollar lost 7.5% for the year.

   There are negatives as well as positive factors in the climbing exports. On
the positive side, the export rise is keeping a lot of people at work in this
country. At the same time, the soft dollar is responsible for raising prices of
imported goods, fueling inflation. Overall, the increased exports are a plus
for the economy but we don't believe it's healthy for the dollar to continue to
decline.

   When credit markets tightened, mergers and acquisitions world-wide declined.
Deals came to 10,027 in the fourth quarter against 11,082 in the third period,
according to Thomson Financial. Despite the sharp fall-off from August through
December, transactions in 2007 increased to $4.5 trillion, a jump of 24% from
2006. Total European volume of $1.8 trillion topped the U.S. for the first time
and beat the record of $1.7 trillion set by the U.S. in 2000. Last year the M&A
volume in the U.S. came to $1.6 trillion.

   We don't expect a quick pickup in mergers and acquisitions. While we will
see some corporate takeovers of companies whose stock seems cheap, there will
be far fewer leveraged buyouts because of the difficulty in obtaining debt
financing. The credit crunch would have to ease a great deal before M&A
activity flourishes again.

   With the emerging markets taking the lead, initial public offerings
worldwide were slightly more active in the second half of 2007, accounting for
54% of the year's offerings, according to Dealogic. Last year saw 1,317 deals
that raised $291.3 billion against 1,097 deals raising $241.6 billion in 2006.
While we have been getting IPO's, it will become harder to underwrite them if
the market declines. Nobody wants to buy IPO's in a really weak market.

   Reflecting the blowouts in the housing and financial markets, earnings of
companies in the S&P 500 Index presented a mixed picture. Operating earnings
for the entire index in the fourth quarter are expected to fall 7.7% from the
2006 period, according to S&P. Excluding the financial sector, earnings of
companies in the index are expected to rise 11.6%. Following are the strongest
areas and their estimated gains: telecommunications 33%, healthcare 24%, and
information technology 23%.

   As far as dividends are concerned, S&P reported that companies in its
500-Index paid a total of $246.6 billion last year, up 11.5% from 2006. The
per-share average reached a record $27.73 in 2007 and S&P forecast a further
increase of 9.3% in 2008. Eleven companies initiated a dividend payment in
2007, bringing the dividend paying total to 389 companies, a seven-year high.
Our guess is that dividend increases will slow down simply because earnings
will not be there to support them.

   At the year-end, companies in the S&P 500 were trading at 19.0 times
earnings, according to


                                      3

<PAGE>


Barron's. This compares with 17.9 times earnings on September 30, 2007, and
18.2 times earnings on December 31, 2006. When the bull market began in October
2002, the P/E ratio was 27. Since World War II, the average P/E ratio is 16.1.
P/E ratios are higher because company earnings fell more than the prices of
their shares. While the year-end valuations may not be expensive, we don't see
many bargains out there at these levels.

   Surprisingly, with all the market turmoil and talk of a possible recession,
advisors' sentiment remains bullish by a wide margin. As of December 31, 2007,
the Investor Intelligence survey of market advisors found 55% bullish and only
23% bearish. This compares with a reading of 56% bulls and 27% bears at the end
of the third quarter and 56% bulls and 20% bears at the close of 2006.

   This excessive optimism by advisors certainly was not helpful for the
market. More realistic views were expressed by members of the American
Association of Individual Investors, who at the year-end stood at 25.7%, bulls
55.2% bears and 19.7% neutral. Since these readings, pessimism has definitely
gone up.

          Sincerely,

          /s/Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

(1)Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the
   Fund's common stock at the opening NYSE share price on the first business
   day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
   investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such years. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               December 31, 2007

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's objective is to seek the highest total
return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

  A. Security Valuation:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price.

   Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations
provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information with respect to
recent sales, market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from
dealers, and various relationships between securities in determining value.

   As required, some securities and other assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors.

   Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in
the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur
between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally
traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally,
the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these
foreign markets. In these cases, information from an external vendor may be
utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to
reflect their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a
frequent basis.

   Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.

                                      15

<PAGE>



   In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
"Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.
The Fund will be adopting SFAS 157 effective with the 3/31/08 reporting of the
financial statements.

  B. Security Transactions and Related Income:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. Income Taxes:

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes
has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."
This standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-return
positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the
more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than
50 percent likely to be realized. Management has analyzed the fund's tax
positions taken on federal income tax returns for all open tax years (tax years
ended December 31, 2004-2007) for purposes of implementing FIN 48, and has
concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably possible
to occur in the next twelve months that would result in the amount of any
unrecognized tax benefits significantly increasing or decreasing for the Fund.

  D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest. As of
December 31, 2007, the Fund increased undistributed net investment income by
$24,406,695, decreased the accumulated net realized loss by $15,782,474, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $40,189,170.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the Schedules of
Investments and Securities Sold Short) consist of undistributed ordinary income
of $0 and undistributed long-term capital gains of $0.

                                      16

<PAGE>



   The Fund has $4,861,360 of capital loss carryovers, $86,434 expiring in 2010
and $4,774,926 expiring in 2011, which may be used to offset future capital
gains. The Fund may not realize the benefit of these losses to the extent it
does not realize gains on investments prior to the expiration of the capital
loss carryovers. For the fiscal year (the "period") ended December 31, 2007,
the Fund utilized losses deferred in prior years of $16,820,078.

   In addition, under certain conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of
these losses to the extent that distributions to shareholders exceed required
distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders
may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.

  E. Foreign Currency Translation:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

  F. Foreign Security Country Determination:

   A combination of the following criteria is used to assign the countries of
risk listed in the Schedule of Investments and Securities Sold Short: country
of incorporation, actual building address, primary exchange on which the
security is traded and country in which the greatest percentage of company
revenue is generated.

  G. Short Sales:

   A short sale is a transaction in which the Fund sells a security it does not
own in anticipation of a decline in market price. To sell a security short, the
Fund must borrow the security. The Fund's obligation to replace the security
borrowed and sold short will be fully collateralized at all times by the
proceeds from the short sale retained by the broker and by cash and securities
deposited in a segregated account with the Fund's custodian. If the price of
the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the
time the Fund replaces the borrowed security, the Fund will realize a loss, and
if the price declines during the period, the Fund will realize a gain. Any
realized gain will be decreased, and any realized loss increased, by the amount
of transaction costs. On ex-dividend date, dividends on short sales are
recorded as an expense to the Fund. At December 31, 2007, the value of
securities sold short amounted to $4,291,220 against which collateral of
$24,064,700 was held. The collateral includes the deposits with the broker for
securities held short and the value of the segregated investments held long, as
shown in the Schedule of Investments and Securities Sold Short. Short selling
used in the management of the Fund may accelerate the velocity of potential
losses if the prices of securities sold short appreciate quickly. Stocks
purchased may decline in value at the same time stocks sold short may
appreciate in value, thereby increasing potential losses.

  H. Security Lending:

   The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Custodian"). Under the terms of
agreement, the Fund is required to maintain

                                      17

<PAGE>


collateral with a market value not less than 100% of the market value of loaned
securities. Collateral is adjusted daily in connection with changes in the
market value of securities on loan. Collateral may consist of cash, securities
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies, sovereign debt of
foreign countries and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by banks. Cash
collateral is invested in a short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on
the collateral and premiums paid by the broker are recorded an income by the
Fund net of fees and rebates charged by the Custodian for its services in
connection with this securities lending program. Lending portfolio securities
involves a risk of delay in the recovery of the loaned securities or in the
foreclosure on collateral.

   At December 31, 2007, the Fund had securities valued at $36,427,667 on loan.
For collateral the Fund received cash collateral of $35,123,438 and non-cash
collateral of $2,193,126.

NOTE 4 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   a) Investment Advisory Fee: The Investment Advisory Agreement (the
"Agreement") between Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC (the "Adviser"), the Fund's
investment adviser, and the Fund provides that, subject to the direction of the
Board of Directors of the Fund and the applicable provisions of the Act, the
adviser is responsible for the actual management of the Fund's portfolio. The
Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd.
("PXP"). PXP is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Phoenix Companies,
Inc. ("PNX"). The responsibility for making decisions to buy, sell or hold a
particular investment rests with the Adviser, subject to review by the Board of
Directors and the applicable provisions of the Act. For the services provided
by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee
equal, on an annual basis to 0.70% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the period ended December 31, 2007, the Fund incurred advisory fees of
$3,711,846.

   Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), which serves as the Sub-Adviser
for the Fund, performs certain asset allocation research and analysis and
provides such advice to the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's fees are paid by the
Adviser.

                                      18

<PAGE>



   b) Administration Fee: Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation ("PEPCO"), an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PNX, serves as the Fund's Administrator
(the "Administrator") pursuant to an Administration Agreement. The
Administrator receives a fee for financial reporting, tax services, and
oversight of the subagent's performance at a rate of 0.065% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. During the period ended December 31, 2007, the Fund
incurred Administration fees of $344,672.

   c) Directors Fee: The Fund pays each Director who is not an interested
person of the Fund or the Adviser a fee of $10,000 per year plus $1,500 per
Directors' or committee meeting attended, together with the out-of-pocket costs
relating to attendance at such meetings. Any Director of the Fund who is an
interested person of the Fund or the Adviser receives no remuneration from the
Fund.

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents, its directors and officers are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At December 31, 2007, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744
shares are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the year ended December 31, 2007 and
the year ended December 31, 2006, 552,046 and 421,068 shares, respectively,
were issued pursuant to the Plan.

   In a non-transferable rights offering ended May 18, 2007, shareholders
exercised rights to purchase 20,730,142 shares of common stock at an offering
price of $4.98 per share for proceeds, net of expenses of $102,586,107.

   On December 17, 2007, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.41 per share
to shareholders of record on December 31, 2007. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 3, 2008, and is payable on January 10, 2008.

NOTE 7 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.


                                      19

<PAGE>



   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 8 --  REGULATORY EXAMS

   In February 2005, the NASD notified PNX that it was asserting violations of
trade reporting rules by a subsidiary. PNX responded to the NASD allegations in
May 2005. Thereafter, in January 2007, the NASD notified PNX that the matter is
being referred for potential violations and possible action. On May 3, 2007,
the NASD accepted a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent submitted by the
PXP subsidiary to resolve this matter. Without admitting or denying the NASD's
findings, in accordance with the terms of the letter the PXP subsidiary agreed
to a censure, to pay a fine of $8,000 and to revise its supervisory procedures.

   The Company does not believe that the outcome of these matters will be
material to these financial statements.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments and securities sold short, and the
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc (the "Fund") at December 31, 2007, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2007 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular, fixed quarterly cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur when
some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A
return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income".

   Please note that the characterization of Fund distributions for federal
income tax purposes is different from book accounting generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). The amounts and sources of distributions
reported in Section 19(a) notices of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are
not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources
of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's
investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be
subject to changes based on tax regulations. It is only after December 31 that
we will know the exact source of our distributions. Shareholders should use
only the Form 1099-DIV that will be mailed by January 31, 2008 to determine the
taxability of our distributions.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan
without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in the best
interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

   Information on the Zweig funds is available at http://www.PhoenixFunds.com.

<PAGE>

         that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with
         statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years
         are $32,600 for 2007 and $32,000 for 2006.

Audit-Related Fees

     (b) The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
         assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are

         Item are $1,000 for 2007 and $1,000 for 2006. This represents the
         review of the semi-annual financial statements.

(e)(1)Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
      described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

     The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") Board has adopted policies
     and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services provided by
     PwC. The Audit Committee pre-approves: (i) all audit and non-audit
     services to be rendered to the Fund by PwC; and (ii) all non-audit
     services to be rendered to the Fund, financial reporting of the Fund
     provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides
     ongoing services to the Fund (collectively, "Covered Services"). The Audit
     Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing a member of the
     Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit
     Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which are not
     otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit committee, provided that
     such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The
     pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit committee's
     responsibilities to management. Pre-approval has not been waived with
     respect to any of the services described above since the date on which the
     Audit Committee adopted its current pre-approval procedures.

(e)(2)The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
      (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to
      paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

         (b) 100% for 2007 and 100% for 2006

<PAGE>

         (c) 100% for 2007 and 100% for 2006

         (d) Not applicable for 2007 and not applicable for 2006

     (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
         other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
         was less than fifty percent.

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
         investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen
         by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
         by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing
         services to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of
         the registrant was $961,830 for 2007 and $892,561 for 2006.

     (h) The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
         considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
         rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
         sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
         entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
         investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
         that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
         accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed registrants.

   The registrant has a separately designated audit committee consisting of all
   the independent directors of the registrant. Audit Committee Members are:
   Charles H. Brunie, Wendy Luscombe, Prof. Alden C. Olson, James B. Rogers and

               STATEMENT OF POLICY WITH RESPECT TO PROXY VOTING

I   Definitions. As used in this Statement of Policy, the following terms shall
    have the meanings ascribed below:

    A.   "Adviser" refers to Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC.

    B.   "Corporate Governance Matters" refers to changes involving the
         corporate ownership or structure of an issuer whose securities are
         within a Portfolio Holding, including changes in the state of
         incorporation, changes in capital structure, including increases and
         decreases of capital and preferred stock issuance, mergers and other
         corporate restructurings, and anti-takeover provisions such as

    C.   "Delegate" refers to the Adviser or Subadviser to whom responsibility
         has been delegated to vote proxies for the applicable Portfolio
         Holding, including any qualified, independent organization engaged by
         the Adviser to vote proxies on behalf of such delegated entity.

    D.   "Fund" shall individually and collectively mean and refer to The Zweig
         Fund, Inc. and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., and each of them.

    E.   "Management Matters" refers to stock option plans and other management
         compensation issues.

    F.   "Portfolio Holding" refers to any company or entity whose securities
         is held within the investment portfolio(s) of one or more of the Fund
         as of the date a proxy is solicited.

    G.   "Proxy Contests" refer to any meeting of shareholders of an issuer for

    I.   "Takeover" refers to "hostile" or "friendly" efforts to effect radical

II. General Policy. It is the intention of the Fund to exercise stock ownership

    further the best economic interests of shareholders of the Fund.
    Accordingly, the Fund or its Delegate(s) shall endeavor to analyze and vote
    all proxies that are considered likely to have financial implications, and,
    where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
    proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and
    its Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts of
    interests in voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in
    accordance with this Statement of Policy.

III.Factors to consider when voting.

    A.   A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect
         on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio
         Holding is indeterminable or insignificant.

    B.   In analyzing anti-takeover measures, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
         long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
         industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
         without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
         operating income, net income, and

<PAGE>

         total shareholder returns (share price appreciation plus dividends).
         Other financial indicators that will be considered include margin
         analysis, cash flow, and debit levels.

    C.   In analyzing contested elections, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
         qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
         consider the independence and attendance record of board and key
         committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile shall
         be completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
         accountability.

    D.   In analyzing corporate governance matters, the Delegate shall vote on
         a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
         economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
         incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
         changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
         supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
         bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

    E.   In analyzing executive compensation proposals and management matters,
         the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into
         consideration such factors as executive pay and spending on
         perquisites, particularly in conjunction with sub-par performance and
         employee layoffs.

    F.   In analyzing proxy contests for control, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
         financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
         management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
         qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what
         each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the
         proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
         positions.

    G.   A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder social matters
         proposals.

IV  Delegation.

    A.   In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board
         of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting
         proxies for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement
         of Policy, or for delegating such responsibility as described below.

    B.   The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
         Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the
         best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall
         accept direction or inappropriate influence from any other client,
         director or employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any
         vote inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the
         prior approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

    C.   With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
         Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
         satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
         Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
         pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
         Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
         thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
         Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
         with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
         however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its
         own proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
         following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
         approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
         determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed
         to further the best economic interests of the affected Fund
         shareholders, and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and
         approved annually by the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will
         promptly notify the Adviser of any material changes to the Subadviser
         Procedures. The Adviser will periodically review the votes by the
         Subadviser for consistency with this Statement of Policy.

V.  Conflicts of Interest

    A.   The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
         conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings
         between the interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of
         the Adviser, Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
         of the Fund, on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into
         account a wide array of factors in determining whether such a conflict
         exists, whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to
         properly address or resolve the same.

    B.   While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
         presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
         or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
         otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
         conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote)
         proxies pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the
         recommendations of an established, independent third party with
         qualifications to vote proxies such as Institutional Shareholder
         Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing
         Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or (iv) where two or more Delegates
         provide conflicting requests, vote shares in proportion to the assets
         under management of the each proposing Delegate.

    C.   The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
         actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
         recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
         shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
         any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
         of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
         Article.

    D.   In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
         Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
         scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
         shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
         apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
         determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

VI. Miscellaneous.

    A.   A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
         and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
         Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
         justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and
         available upon request.

    B.   The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from
         this Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the
         Board of Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of
         Trustees may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to
         the Fund or any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy
         voting pursuant to this Statement of Policy at such times and in such
         format or medium as the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser
         shall be solely responsible for complying with the disclosure and
         reporting requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
         including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
         Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and present
         information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
         each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine
         from time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure
         and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment
         Company Act of 1940, as amended.

    C.   The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
         Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
         the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such
         proxies were voted.

    D.   The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
         committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case
         may be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any duly
         authorized committee, may engage the services of a research and/or
         voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by such
         entity.

<PAGE>

This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees annually
for their amendment and/or approval.

     Potential Conflicts of Interests

     There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
     connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
     Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts he manages.
     Such conflicts could arise from the aggregation of orders for all accounts
     managed by a particular portfolio manager, the allocation of purchases
     across all such accounts, the allocation of IPOs and any soft dollar
     arrangements that the Adviser may have in place that could benefit the
     Funds and/or such other accounts. The Board of Trustees/Directors has
     adopted on behalf of the Funds policies and procedures designed to address
     any such conflicts of interest to ensure that all transactions are
     executed in the best interest of the Funds' shareholders. The Advisers and
     Subadviser are required to certify their compliance with these procedures
     to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis. There have been no material
     compliance issues with respect to any of these policies and procedures
     during the Funds' most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
     Additionally, there are no material conflicts of interest between the
     investment strategy of a Fund and the investment strategy of other
     accounts managed by Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson since portfolio managers
     generally manage funds and other accounts having similar investment
     strategies.

(a)(3)Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team Members

     For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2007,
     following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's compensation
     structure as portfolio managers of PZA and Euclid.

     Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd. and its affiliated investment management
     firms (collectively, "PXP"), believe that the firm's compensation program
     is adequate and competitive to attract and retain high-caliber investment
     professionals. Investment professionals at PXP receive a competitive base
     salary, an incentive bonus opportunity and a benefits package. Managing
     Directors and portfolio investment professionals who supervise and manage
     others also participate in a management incentive program reflecting their
     personal contribution and team performance. Highly compensated individuals
     can also take advantage of a long-term Incentive Compensation program to
     defer their compensation and reduce tax implications.

     The bonus package for portfolio managers is based upon how well the
     individual manager meets or exceeds assigned goals and subjective
     assessment of contribution to the team effort. Their incentive bonus

<PAGE>

     also reflects a performance component for achieving and/or exceeding
     performance competitive with peers managing similar strategies. Such
     component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for managing
     within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary risks. This
     ensures that investment personnel will remain focused on managing and
     acquiring securities that correspond to a fund's mandate and risk profile.
     It also avoids the temptation for portfolio managers to take on more risk
     and unnecessary exposure to chase performance for personal gain.

     Finally, Portfolio Managers and investment professionals may also receive
     The Phoenix Companies, Inc. ("PNX") stock options and/or be granted PNX
     restricted stock at the direction of the parent's Board of Directors.

     Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure of
     the Fund's portfolio managers.

     Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which is
     determined by PXP and is designed to be competitive in light of the
     individual's experience and responsibilities. PXP management uses
     compensation survey results of investment industry compensation conducted
     by an independent third party in evaluating competitive market
     compensation for its investment management professionals.

     Incentive Bonus. Generally, the current Performance Incentive Plan for
     portfolio managers at PXP is made up of three components:

     (1) Seventy percent of the target incentive is based on achieving
         investment area investment goals and individual performance. The
         Investment Incentive pool will be established based on actual pre-tax
         investment performance compared with specific peer group or index
         measures established at the beginning of each calendar year.
         Performance of the funds managed is measured over one, three and
         five-year periods against specified benchmarks and/or peer groups for
         each fund managed. Performance of the PNX general account and growth
         of revenue, if applicable to a particular portfolio manager, is
         measured on a one-year basis. Generally, individual manager's
         participation is based on the performance of each fund/account managed
         as weighted roughly by total assets in each of those funds/accounts.

     (2) Fifteen percent of the target incentive is based on the profitability
         of the investment management division with which the portfolio manager
         is associated. This component of the plan is paid in restricted stock
         units of The Phoenix Companies, Inc., which vest over three years.

     (3) Fifteen percent of the target incentive is based on the portfolio
         manager's investment area's competencies and on individual
         performance. This pool is funded based on The Phoenix Companies,
         Inc.'s return on equity.

     The Performance Incentive Plan applicable to some portfolio managers may
     vary from the description above. For instance, plans applicable to certain
     portfolio managers (i) may specify different percentages of target
     incentive that is based on investment goals and individual performance and
     on The Phoenix Companies, Inc. return on equity, (ii) may not contain the
     component that is based on the profitability of the management division
     with which the portfolio manager is associated, or (iii) may contain a
     guarantee payout percentage of certain portions of the Performance
     Incentive Plan.

     Long-Term Incentive Bonus. Certain portfolio managers are eligible for a
     long-term incentive plan that is paid in restricted stock units of The
     Phoenix Companies, Inc. which vest over three years. Awards under this
     plan are contingent upon PNX achieving its cash return on equity
     objective, generally over a three-year period. Target award opportunities
     for eligible participants are determined by PNX's Compensation Committee.

<PAGE>

     Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
     broad-based plans offered generally to the firm's employees, including
     broad-based retirement, 401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.

                       SENIOR MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS

I  Background

   Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that each registered
investment company disclose whether or not it has adopted a code of ethics that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or
a third party (collectively, "Senior Management"). If a fund has not adopted
such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so in certain
regulatory filings.

   Pursuant to various management agreements between The Zweig Fund, Inc. and
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") and Phoenix subsidiaries,
Phoenix employees currently serve as Senior Management to the Funds. As
employees of Phoenix they are subject to the Phoenix Code of Ethics (the
"PCE"). The PCE complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other relevant
requirements. The Boards of Directors of the Funds, on October 1, 2003, adopted
the Phoenix Code of Ethics for the Senior Management of the Funds.

II Board Resolution adopted on October 1, 2003

   WHEREAS, that Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that
each registered investment company publicly disclose whether or not it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals
are employed by the fund or a third party (collectively, "Senior Management");
and

   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Phoenix Code of Conduct, as
presented at this meeting, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Senior Management Code") and has determined the same to provide written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the
types of conduct by Senior Management that are contemplated by regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; now, therefore, be it

   RESOLVED, that the Fund does hereby approve and adopt the Senior Management
Code as the written code of ethics that applies to its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether
these individuals are employed by the Fund or a third party;

   FURTHER RESOLVED, the Chairman of the Fund, with the advice of counsel and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
shall be appointed and directed to oversee the consideration and granting of
any waivers of the Senior Management Code with respect to Senior Management
other than the Chairman provided however that the Chairman shall provide notice
of any such waiver to the Board of Directors at the next succeeding regularly
scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors and provided further that any
requested waivers involving the Chairman shall be presented to the Board for
approval; and

   FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Compliance Officer of The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. be, and she or he hereby is, authorized and directed to
implement, and oversee compliance with, and administration of the Senior
Management Code and to take such further action and deliver and execute any and
all instruments, certificates and documents as she or he may deem necessary or
appropriate, with the advice of counsel, to fully carry out the purposes and
intent of the Senior Management Code.

<PAGE>

Commitment to Shareholders

Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.

Conflicts of Interest

Phoenix expects each of its employees and directors to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or director, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or
her position in the Company.

An employee requested by Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another
company owes a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose
board of directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between
the interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested by
Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another company may accept fees
or other compensation for board service. In the event the company for which an
employee serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any
remuneration received by the employee must be donated to a charitable
organization. The Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the
employee.

All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees and directors are required to file a Conflict of Interest
Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following completion
of the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to the Chief
Compliance Officer in writing.

Corporate Opportunities

Employees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate
interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees and
directors are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:

   .   taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
       the use of corporate property, information or position;

   .   using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and

   .   competing with the Company.

Insider Trading and Personal Trading

Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee or director may buy or sell
Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information. This
restriction also applies to an employee's or director's spouse, other adults
living in the employee's or director's household, minor children and persons
for whom the employee exercises investment authority. Employees, directors and
their family members also must avoid passing non-public information on to third
parties.

<PAGE>

Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of
the company to which the information relates.

Directors, officers and their family members1 are also subject to certain
restrictions under New York Insurance Law governing acquisition of Phoenix
shares. Until June 25, 2006, directors and officers, whether acting directly or
indirectly, may only acquire, or offer to acquire, such shares: (i) through a
Phoenix plan; or (ii) through a registered broker or dealer at quoted prices on
the date of purchase. Family members may only acquire such shares through the
latter method.

All directors, all employees with a title of Vice President or higher, plus
certain other employees whose positions place them in regular contact with
non-public information, and certain family members of all of them are subject
to a further restriction as well: these individuals may only buy or sell
Phoenix securities during "window" periods. You have been or will be notified:
(i) if these restrictions apply to you; and (ii) when periods begin and end.

In addition, officers with a title of Executive Vice President or higher,
certain other individuals who have been notified by the Corporate Secretary,
and certain family members of each of them, must pre-clear all transactions in
Phoenix securities through our Corporate Secretary. Further, they must promptly
report such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

No employee or director may buy or sell securities of another company with the
knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or sale by
Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any of the Company's advisory accounts. In
the case of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the
outstanding equity, no employee (nor certain family members) may make any
personal investment without prior approval from the Law Department.

Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure pre-clearance of and/or
report all personal securities transactions by these individuals. In addition,
the Company reserves the right to require duplicate confirmations, quarterly
transaction reports and prior clearance for any personal securities
transactions by those individuals. If you have any question as to whether your
position requires pre-clearance or reporting, you should contact the compliance
officer for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer) or the
Corporate Compliance Department.

Footnote 1 An officer's or director's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
step-parent, grandparent, spouse, or sibling, including in-laws and adoptive
relationships.

Market Timing

Company policy prohibits employees from engaging in excessive trading or market
timing activities with respect to any mutual fund, regardless of whether such
mutual fund is affiliated with the Company. This prohibition does not apply to
money market funds or other funds designed to permit short term investment or
to non-volitional investment vehicles such as 401(k) plans, automatic
reinvestment programs, or asset allocation programs.

Confidentiality

Directors and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of
information entrusted to them in the course of their work for the Company.
Disclosure of confidential information is restricted to authorized persons or
situations in which disclosure is legally mandated. Confidential information
includes all non-public information about the Company or persons with which it
conducts business (such as customers, vendors and potential investment targets)
including, but not limited to: internal operating procedures; investment
strategies; sales data and customer lists; financial plans; projections; and
clients' personal information. (See also Privacy and Confidential Personal
Information below). A director's or employee's obligation to protect
confidential information continues even after termination of his or her
position with the Company.

<PAGE>

Protection and Use of Company

Property and Assets

Employees have access to Company property to assist them in effectively
carrying out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used
for legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property
and ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a
direct impact on the Company's profitability.

Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.

Contract Review

The following contracts must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to being
  signed, amended or terminated early:

   .   Contracts that involve an expenditure or value of greater than $25,000;

   .   Contracts that pose significant legal obligations on Phoenix (such as an
       obligation not to solicit business, not to hire, or to provide
       indemnification); and

   .   Contracts that involve employment or consulting services.

In addition, contracts that could have a significant impact on Phoenix's
financial results or reports must be reviewed by Corporate Finance for business
risks and financial implications.

Corporate Disclosures

As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about the Company. It is imperative that such information
be disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with SEC disclosure
requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that information released
is accurate and properly disseminated, only certain individuals are authorized
to speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are prohibited from speaking with
rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press without obtaining prior
authorization from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Employees
receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to the appropriate
area for response:

   .   Members of the Press - to the senior officer, Corporate Communications;

   .   Rating Agencies - to any officer in the Rating Agency Relations unit; and

   .   Securities Analysts and Investors - to any officer in the Investor
       Relations unit.

In order to enable the Company to comply with applicable law, Company policy
prohibits directors and employees from publicly disclosing any non-public
information about the Company's financial performance, other than at times and
through methods approved by the Company's President or Chief Financial Officer.
Employees are also prohibited from commenting on the Company's stock
performance.

Accuracy and Retention of Company Records

The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The falsification, misuse or inappropriate alteration of Company documents is
strictly prohibited.

Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately recorded on the Company's
books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
any other required accounting basis and established Company policy. Financial
information must fairly represent all relevant information.

The retention and destruction of Company records must follow established
Company policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

<PAGE>

Commitment to Customers

Phoenix upholds its commitment to our customers by conducting our business
fairly and honestly and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all
dealings with customers.

Safeguarding Customer Assets

Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees
must not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other
assets, or assist another individual in doing so.

Ethical Market Conduct

The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:

   .   conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;

   .   provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;

   .   engage in active and fair competition;

   .   provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;

   .   handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
       manner; and

   .   monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with
       ethical market conduct.

Privacy and Confidential Personal Information

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans or health.

The misuse of confidential personal information could subject the Company and
its employees to civil liability or criminal penalties. Before releasing
confidential information to anyone, employees must make certain that releasing
it is permitted under the Company's policies or authorized in writing by the
person to whom it relates.

Customer Complaints

The Company is committed to fairly and expeditiously handling all customer
complaints. All complaints must be handled and reported in accordance with
established corporate policies as well as procedures established for the
applicable business unit or affiliate. To facilitate resolution of each
customer complaint, as well as to facilitate any related regulatory inquiries,
all customer complaints and related communications are centrally retained.

Fraud

The Company strongly supports all efforts to detect and prevent fraud. It
believes that only through aggressive action to combat fraud can the Company
continue to meet its fundamental obligations to its stockholders and customers.
When there is reason to believe that the Company has been the target of fraud
or attempted fraud, it will aggressively work with the appropriate law
enforcement officials to seek prosecution and conviction of the responsible
individual(s). Any employee who is aware or suspects that the Company has been
the target of fraud or attempted fraud should report it to the Corporate Audit
Department immediately.

<PAGE>

Insurance Anti-Fraud Plan

In accordance with insurance regulatory requirements, the Company has a
comprehensive insurance anti-fraud plan that is designed to:

   .   prevent insurance fraud, including internal fraud involving the
       Company's officers, employees or agents, fraud resulting from
       misrepresentations on applications for insurance, and claims fraud;

   .   report insurance fraud to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
       authorities;

   .   encourage cooperation in the prosecution of insurance fraud cases; and

   .   aggressively pursue recovery of all sums improperly paid by the Company
       as a result of fraud.

Commitment to Corporate Citizenship

Phoenix is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which includes
complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as well as engaging in fair competition in the marketplace.

Complying with Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Company expects all employees to conduct business in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations related to the
financial services industry are complex, thus placing a duty on each employee
to take all reasonable steps to ensure his or her actions are in compliance.
Compliance with the law does not, however, comprise our entire ethical
responsibility. Rather, it is a minimum standard for performance of our duties.
(See also the provisions below on Commitment to Ethics and Compliance).

Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls and Auditing Matters

The Company treats complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls,
or auditing matters seriously and expeditiously. Employees have the opportunity
to submit confidential and anonymous complaints about accounting or auditing
matters for review by representatives of Phoenix, and if appropriate, the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. These complaints will be handled in a
manner that protects the confidentiality and anonymity of the employee when so
requested by the employee. (See the Toll-Free Help Line section of this Code,
on page 11).

No employee will be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for submitting a
complaint under this procedure if he or she reasonably believes that the
complaint may involve a violation of federal securities or anti-fraud laws.

Fair Dealing

Each employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
misrepresentation of material facts, or other unfair-dealing practice.

Antitrust

The Company is committed to preserving a free and competitive marketplace and
will not engage in any understandings or agreements with any competitor that
could result in a restraint of trade. Employees must avoid engaging in any
conduct that violates the antitrust laws, such as agreements with competitors
regarding prices, terms of sale, division of markets and allocations of
customers. Discussions with competitors related to market share, projected
sales for any specific product or service, revenues and expenses, production
schedules, unannounced products and services, pricing or marketing strategies
are prohibited.

The antitrust laws and, thus, the above prohibitions, also apply to informal
contacts with competitors, such as encounters at trade shows or meetings of
professional organizations. Every employee has an obligation to avoid
situations that could result in a violation of the antitrust laws.

<PAGE>

Anti-Money Laundering

It is the responsibility of every employee to protect the Company from
exploitation by individuals engaged in money laundering activities.
Accordingly, affected employees must:

   .   become familiar with the anti-money laundering laws and their
       requirements as applied to the Company; and

   .   learn and fully comply with the Company's anti-money laundering policies
       and procedures.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or the Company's policies may result in
significant criminal and civil penalties for the Company as well as for those
individuals involved. Furthermore, even association with money laundering
activity could subject both the Company and its employees to civil and criminal
penalties.

Lobbying and Political Contributions

Lobbying is generally defined as communicating with a public official, or a
member of his or her staff, in the legislative or executive branch of
government, for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative
action. Lobbying is highly regulated and lobbyists are required to be
registered and to report their activities. No employee may engage in lobbying
on behalf of Phoenix without prior permission of the Law Department. The giving
of gifts to local public officials and members of their staff, whether in the
form of meals, tickets to events or otherwise, is strictly regulated by most
states and by the federal government. Special restrictions also apply to
employees who provide investment management services to public entities.

Employees must be careful to distinguish between personal and corporate
political activities. Unless specifically requested by the Company to
communicate on its behalf on a particular issue, you should identify
communications with legislators as expressing your own personal beliefs and not
those of Phoenix. The use of Phoenix stationery for any personal political
communication is prohibited. Any employee wishing to be a candidate for
elective office should consult with his or her supervisor and department head
in advance.

Questions regarding the Company's position on proposed legislation or
regulations should be directed to Government Relations or the Law Department.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the payment or authorization of the
payment of any money, or the giving of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of:

   .   influencing any act or decision of the foreign official; or

   .   inducing the foreign official to use his influence to assist in
       obtaining business for or directing business to any person.

A "foreign official" is any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of
a foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality. Also included
under the term "foreign official" are foreign political parties, officials of
political parties and candidates for foreign political office.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to all directors, employees and
agents of the Company. Violation of the act can result in both fines and
imprisonment.

Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents

Employees must avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of
others. Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks, service marks,
patents and trade secrets. Improper use includes copying, distributing or
modifying third party copyrighted materials without permission. Infringement
may result in criminal as well as civil liabilities for Phoenix and its
employees.

The Company has an agreement with the Copyright Clearance Center that gives a
license to Phoenix employees to make photocopies of many publications for
business purposes. Questions about the types of copying that are covered by the
agreement should be directed to the Corporate Compliance Department.

<PAGE>

Commitment to Employees

Phoenix's employees are our most important asset and we are committed to
fostering a work environment in which employees have the opportunity to grow,
contribute and participate free from discrimination.

Equal Opportunity

The Company employs and promotes on the basis of merit and achievement without
regard to age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, marital status, or disability. This policy applies to every phase
of the employment process and every aspect of the employment relationship:
recruitment, hiring, training, promotions, transfers, terminations, benefits,
compensation and participation in Company-sponsored educational, social and
recreational programs.

Sexual Harassment

The Company prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment
includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, visual or physical conduct when:

   .   submission is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition
       of a person's employment;

   .   submission to or rejection of inappropriate conduct by an employee is
       used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or

   .   the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
       an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
       offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment also includes: unwelcome sexual flirtations and advances;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate touching; graphic or verbal
comments about an individual's body; displaying in the workplace a sexually
suggestive object or picture; and sexually explicit or offensive jokes.

Employment of Relatives

Except in the limited circumstances described in this section, the Company does
not permit the employment of a director's or employee's "relative", which term
includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, step-parent,
step-child, step-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece,
or first cousin including in-laws. Specifically, the Company prohibits the
hiring of a "relative" of any director or officer, or of any employee working
in the Corporate Audit, Corporate Compliance, Human Resources or Law
Departments. Although this policy does not require the termination of any
employee who becomes related to a person described in the preceding sentence
through a post-hiring event such as marriage or a promotion, any employee who
becomes "related" through such an occurrence should promptly advise his or her
supervisor. The Company will then take steps to assure that no employee reports
to or supervises a relative and that related employees do not work in the same
department or report to the same supervisor. The employment of a "relative" of
any officer at the level of Executive Vice President or higher will not be
permitted or accommodated even if the relationship results from a post-hiring
event.

Workplace Safety

The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and
healthy for its employees and others. All job-related injuries or illnesses
should be reported immediately to your supervisor or Human Resources
representative. Questions concerning health and safety matters should also be
referred to one of them.

The Company does not tolerate acts of violence or threats of violence against
employees or Company property. Possession of firearms or other weapons anywhere
on Company property or while conducting Company business is prohibited. Any
situation or concern involving violent behavior or the threat of violence
should be immediately reported to Security or Human Resources.

<PAGE>

Drugs and Alcohol

The sale, purchase, use, possession or transfer of narcotics or other legally
controlled substances by employees while on Company premises or on Company
business (other than use of prescription drugs in accordance with a physician's
orders) is prohibited. Employees attending functions on behalf of the Company
where alcohol is served are expected to use good judgment and avoid consuming
excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages.

Felony Convictions

Federal law prohibits the employment by an insurance company, without the
consent of the appropriate state insurance department, of any person convicted
of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust. To assist the Company in
fulfilling its responsibilities under this law, employees are required to
disclose any felony conviction to the Company at the time of application for
employment. Any employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony must report
this fact to the Company immediately.

Employee Ownership of Phoenix Stock

Employees and directors are subject to various requirements governing their
ownership of Company stock, including federal securities law and New York
insurance law. Please refer to the Insider Trading and Personal Trading section
of this Code (at page 1) for more information.

Commitment to Ethics and Compliance

A strong commitment to business ethics and compliance is the foundation of a
successful organization. Every employee is expected
to carry out the Company's business activities in an ethical manner
and in a fashion consistent with applicable laws, regulations, policies and
  guidelines.

Ethical Decision Making

Phoenix's success is dependent on each of us applying the highest ethical
standards to whatever we do on behalf of the Company. Employees should consider
the following questions before making decisions.

   .   Is my action consistent with approved Company practices?

   .   Is my action consistent with the Company's values?

   .   Does my action give the appearance of impropriety?

   .   Can I, in good conscience, defend my action to my supervisor, other
       employees and the general public?

   .   Does my action meet my personal code of ethical behavior?

   .   Does my action conform to the spirit of these and all other applicable
       guidelines?

Monitoring Code Compliance

The Corporate Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are responsible
for monitoring the compliance activities of all areas of the Company and for
ensuring that this Code of Conduct is being followed. Compliance will be
monitored by periodic audits where appropriate. Additionally, the Company's
Chief Compliance Officer must report annually to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors on the level of compliance with our requirement that each
employee and director complete the Code of Conduct Acknowledgement and the
Conflict of Interest Declaration. Waivers of violations of the Code by
directors or by officers with a title of Senior Vice President or higher may
only be granted by the Audit Committee or the Board. Such waivers must be
promptly reported to shareholders. All other waivers, which may be granted by
the Chief Compliance Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President,
shall be reported to the Audit Committee but need not be reported to the
shareholders.

<PAGE>

Toll-Free Help Line

Phoenix maintains a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free telephone help line for
employees for the purpose of requesting assistance concerning, or reporting
violations of, this Code or reporting complaints about accounting or auditing
matters. The number is: 1-800-813-8180.

Assistance is available during regular business hours. If you call outside of
regular business hours, you may leave a confidential message and your call will
be returned the following business day. Special security measures have been
taken with this help line to ensure confidentiality. If you wish to remain
anonymous, you may request a case identification number and refer to that
number in subsequent phone calls.

Obligation to Report

Employees are obligated to report suspected violations of this Code to their
department head, the Chief Compliance Officer or the Law Department.

Whistleblower Protection

No retaliation or retribution of any kind will be taken against an employee
who, in good faith, reports a suspected violation of this Code.

Investigation

All allegations of suspected violations will be promptly investigated and
appropriate action will be taken. Investigations will be conducted in an
objective, professional manner. The specifics of an investigation, including
the identity of the individual reporting the information, will be kept
confidential except as such disclosure is necessary to fully investigate the
allegations, facilitate resolution and/or report the results to appropriate
authorities.

Disclosure to Government Authorities

Certain actions and omissions prohibited by this Code may also violate criminal
laws and may subject violators to criminal prosecution. The Law Department will
review the results of investigations that indicate potential violations of
criminal law and recommend to the appropriate senior officers whether
disclosure to appropriate enforcement authorities is warranted.

Disciplinary Action for Violations

Failure to adhere to this Code, other Company policies or applicable laws or
government regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Situations in which disciplinary action may be
appropriate include the following, insofar as they relate to conduct of the
Company's business:

   .   authorization of or participation in activities that violate the law,
       government regulations, this Code or other Company policies;

   .   retaliation, direct or indirect, or encouragement of others to retaliate
       against a Company employee who reports a suspected violation;

   .   failure to cooperate with an investigation of suspected violations,
       including interfering with or obstructing an investigation; and

   .   failure to report a suspected violation of the law, government
       regulations, this Code or other Company policies.
