(1)  Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2)  PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return is
determined by subtracting the initial  investment  from the redeemable  value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and
expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income
dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained
under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan. Total investment  return does not
reflect broker  commissions or sales charges.  Total return for a period greater
than one year  represents  the average  annual total return.  Total return for a
period of less than one year is not annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative  minimum tax.  Closed-end  funds,  unlike  open-end  funds,  are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3)  Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend payable to common shareholders by the market price per common
share at November 30, 2003.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
November 30, 2003 (unaudited)
================================================================================

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal  Income Fund II ("Municipal  II"),  PIMCO  California  Municipal
Income Fund II ("California  Municipal II") and PIMCO New York Municipal  Income
Fund II ("New York  Municipal  II")  collectively  referred to as the "Funds" or
"PIMCO  Municipal  Income Funds II", were  organized as  Massachusetts  business
trusts on March 29, 2002.  Prior to commencing  operations on June 28, 2002, the
Funds had no operations  other than matters  relating to their  organization and
registration as closed-end  management investment companies registered under the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940 and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  as
amended,  and the sale and  issuance of 6,981 shares of  beneficial  interest of
each  Fund at an  aggregate  purchase  price of  $100,003  per  Fund to  Allianz
Dresdner  Asset  Management  of America  L.P.,  ("ADAM").  PIMCO  Advisors  Fund
Management  LLC, (the  "Investment  Manager"),  serves as the Fund's  Investment
Manager  and  is an  indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  ADAM.  ADAM  is an
indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds have an unlimited
amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

Municipal II invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal
bonds,  the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes.  California
Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds which
pay interest that is exempt from federal and California  state income taxes. New
York  Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds
which pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York State and New York City
income  taxes.  The Funds will seek to avoid bonds  generating  interest  income
which could  potentially  subject  individuals to  alternative  minimum tax. The
issuers'  abilities  to meet their  obligations  may be affected by economic and
political developments in a specific state or region.

Municipal  II,  California  Municipal  II  and  New  York  Municipal  II  issued
50,500,000,  26,000,000 and 9,000,000 shares of common stock,  respectively,  in
their initial public offerings. An additional 7,001,148, 3,900,000 and 1,294,833
shares of  Municipal  II,  California  Municipal II and New York  Municipal  II,
respectively,  were issued in connection with the exercises of the underwriters'
over-allotment option on July 15, 2002 and August 6, 2002. These shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
The Investment  Manager agreed to reimburse the amount by which the aggregate of
each Fund's  organizational  and common  offering  costs (other than sales load)
exceeded $0.03 per common share.  Common offering costs of $1,174,197,  $682,616
and  $308,845  (representing  $0.02  per  common  share  for  Municipal  II  and
California  Municipal II and $0.03 per common share for New York  Municipal II),
were offset  against  the  proceeds of the  offerings  and have been  charged to
paid-in capital in excess of par.

In addition,  the  underwriters  discount and offering costs associated with the
Funds'  issuance of Preferred  Shares in the amounts of $5,050,000 and $366,317,
$2,600,000 and $269,348 and $900,000 and $149,609,  for Municipal II, California
Municipal  II and New York  Municipal  II,  respectively,  have been  charged to
paid-in capital in excess of par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business the Funds enter into  contracts  that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Funds'
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have not
yet been asserted. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be remote.

The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting  policies  consistently
followed by the Funds:

(a)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily  available are stated at market value.  Debt  securities  are valued
daily by an  independent  pricing  service  approved  by the Board of  Trustees.
Prices may be obtained from  independent  pricing services which use information
provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data
relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. The value of
the Funds'  investments is determined at the close of regular trading (normally,
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each day the
NYSE is open. Short term  investments  maturing in sixty days or less are valued
at  amortized  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Certain  fixed income
securities for which daily market  quotations  are not readily  available may be
valued,  pursuant  to  guidelines  established  by the Board of  Trustees,  with
reference to fixed income  securities whose prices are more readily  obtainable.
The prices used by the Funds to value  securities may differ from the value that
would be realized if the securities were sold.

November 30, 2003 (unaudited)
================================================================================

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(b)  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt  securities  purchased  are  accreted  or  amortized  daily to  non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(c)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Funds intend to distribute  all of their  taxable  income and to comply with
the other  requirements of the U.S.  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of their taxable  ordinary  income and long-term  capital gains,  if any, during
each calendar  year,  the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.  federal excise
tax.

(d)  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK

The  Funds  declare  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least  annually.   Each  Fund  records   dividends  and   distributions  to  its
shareholders on the ex-dividend  date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net  investment  income and net realized  capital  gains are  determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations,  which may differ from generally
accepted  accounting   principles.   These  "book-tax"  differences  are  either
considered  either  temporary  or  permanent  in  nature.  To the  extent  these
differences are permanent in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the
capital  accounts  based  on  their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary
differences  do not require  reclassification.  To the extent  dividends  and/or
distributions  exceed current and  accumulated  earnings and profits for federal
income tax  purposes  they are  reported as dividends  and/or  distributions  of
paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e)  FUTURES CONTRACTS

A  futures  contract  is an  agreement  between  two  parties  to buy and sell a
financial  instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract,  the Funds are  required  to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum  "initial margin"  requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts,  the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily  fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such  receipts or payments are known as  "variation  margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation.  When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the  contracts  at the time they were  opened  and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized  appreciation or depreciation  recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of an
imperfect  correlation  in the  movements  in the  price of  futures  contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets,  and the possible  inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(f)  OPTION TRANSACTIONS

For  hedging  purposes,  the Funds may  purchase  and write  (sell) put and call
options on municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements, indexes
or  futures  contracts  which are  standardized  and  traded on a U.S.  or other
exchange,  boards of  trade,  or  similar  entity,  or  quoted  on an  automated
quotation  system.  The risk  associated  with  purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium  whether or not the option is exercised.  Additionally,  the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium  and  change in market  value  should the
counterparty not perform under the contract.  Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities
acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid.
The  proceeds  from the  securities  sold through the exercise of put options is
decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written,  the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability  which is  subsequently  adjusted to the current market value of
the  option  written.  Premiums  received  from  writing  options  which  expire
unexercised  are  recorded  on the  expiration  date  as a  realized  gain.  The
difference  between the  premium  received  and the amount  paid on  effecting a
closing purchase transaction,  including brokerage commissions,  is also treated
as a realized  gain,  or if the  premium  is less than the  amount  paid for the
closing  purchase  transactions,  as a  realized  loss.  If  a  call  option  is
exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is  exercised,  the premium  reduces the cost basis of the  security.  In
writing an option,  the Funds bear the market risk of an  unfavorable  change in
the price of the security  underlying the written option.  Exercise of an option
written  could result in the Funds  purchasing  a security at a price  different
from the current market price.

================================================================================

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

(g)  RESIDUAL INTEREST MUNICIPAL BONDS (RIBS)

The Funds invest in Residual  Interest  Municipal  Bond ("RIBS")  whose interest
rates bear an inverse  relationship to the interest rate on another  security or
the value of an index,  RIBS are created by dividing the income stream  provided
by the  underlying  bonds to  create  two  securities,  one  short-term  and one
long-term. The interest rate on the short-term component is reset by an index or
auction  process  normally  every seven to 35 days.  After income is paid on the
short-term  securities at current rates, the residual income from the underlying
bond(s) goes to the long-term securities.  Therefore, rising short-term interest
rates result in lower income for the longer-term  portion,  and vice versa.  The
longer-term  bonds may be more  volatile  and less liquid  than other  Municipal
Bonds of  comparable  maturity.  An investment  in RIBS  typically  will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

(h)  CUSTODY CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES

The Funds benefit from an expense offset  arrangement  with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian and
accounting  agent  expenses.  Had these cash  balances  been  invested in income
producing securities, they would have generated income for the Funds.

2.   INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER

Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreements")
with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to each Fund. Subject
to the supervision by each Fund's Board of Trustees,  the Investment  Manager is
responsible for managing,  either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment  activities  of the Fund and the Fund's  business  affairs  and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,  the Investment Manager will
receive an annual  fee,  payable  monthly,  at the annual  rate of 0.65% of each
Fund's  average  daily net  assets  (including  net assets  attributable  to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order to reduce Fund expenses, the
Investment Manager has contractually  agreed to reimburse each Fund for fees and
expenses  at the annual rate of 0.15% of each  Fund's  average  daily net assets
(including  net  assets  attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be
outstanding) from the commencement of operations  through June 30, 2007, and for
a declining amount thereafter through June 30, 2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser") to manage each Fund's  investments.  Subject to
the supervision of the Investment Manager,  the Sub-Adviser makes all investment
decisions  with respect to each Fund's assets.  The Investment  Manager (not the
Funds) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the  Sub-Adviser  in return for
its services,  at the maximum  annual rate of 0.50% of each Fund's average daily
net assets  (including net assets  attributable to any preferred shares that may
be outstanding).  The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of
the fees it is entitled to receive from the  Investment  Manager,  such that the
Sub-Adviser  will  receive  0.26%  of  each  Fund's  average  daily  net  assets
(including  net  assets  attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be
outstanding)  from the  commencement of the Funds'  operations  through June 30,
2007, and will receive an increasing  amount (not to exceed 0.50% of each Fund's
average  daily net assets,  including net assets  attributable  to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through June 30, 2009. The Investment
Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser $1,720,139, $876,500 and
$303,452 in connection with  sub-advisory  services for Municipal II, California
Municipal II and New York Municipal II,  respectively,  for the six months ended
November 30, 2003.

The Funds are subject to certain  limitations and  restrictions  while Preferred
Shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Funds  from  declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

*   Commencement of operations

**  Initial public offering price of $15.00 per share less underwriting discount
    of $0.675 per share.

(1) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock at
    the current  market  price on the first day of each period and a sale at the
    current market price on the last day for each period reported. Dividends and
    distributions  are  assumed,  for  purposes  of  this  calculation,   to  be
    reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan.
    Total  investment  return does not reflect  brokerage  commissions  or sales
    charges.  Total investment  return for a period of less than one year is not
    annualized.

(2) Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common and
    preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common shareholders.

(3) Inclusive of expenses  offset by custody  credits earned on cash balances at
    the custodian bank. (See note 1(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).

(4) Annualized.

(5) During the periods indicated above, the Investment  Manager waived a portion
    of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in effect, the
    ratio of  expenses  to average  net  assets and the ratio of net  investment
    income to average net assets  would have been 1.29%  (annualized)  and 8.09%
    (annualized),  respectively  for the six months ended  November 30, 2003 and
    1.18% (annualized) and 6.76% (annualized),  respectively for the period June
    28, 2002 (commencement of operations) through May 31, 2003.

(1) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock at
    the current  market  price on the first day of each period and a sale at the
    current market price on the last day for each period reported. Dividends and
    distributions  are  assumed,  for  purposes  of  this  calculation,   to  be
    reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan.
    Total  investment  return does not reflect  brokerage  commissions  or sales
    charges.  Total investment  return for a period of less than one year is not
    annualized.

(2) Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common and
    preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common shareholders.

(3) Inclusive of expenses  offset by custody  credits earned on cash balances at
    the custodian bank. (See note 1(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).

(4) Annualized.

(5) During the periods indicated above, the Investment  Manager waived a portion
    of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in effect, the
    ratio of  expenses  to average  net  assets and the ratio of net  investment
    income to average net assets  would have been 1.32%  (annualized)  and 8.34%
    (annualized),  respectively  for the six months ended  November 30, 2003 and
    1.20% (annualized) and 6.34% (annualized),  respectively for the period June
    28, 2002 (commencement of operations) through May 31, 2003.

               reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying  officers and I have disclosed to the
