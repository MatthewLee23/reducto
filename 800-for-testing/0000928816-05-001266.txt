What makes Putnam different?

[GRAPHIC OMITTED: FOUNDER]

In 1830, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Justice Samuel Putnam
established The Prudent Man Rule, a legal foundation for responsible money
management.

THE PRUDENT MAN RULE

All that can be required of a trustee to invest is that he shall conduct
himself faithfully and exercise a sound discretion. He is to observe how
men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence manage their own affairs,
not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition
of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable
safety of the capital to be invested.

[GRAPHIC OMITTED: SIGNATURE, JUSTICE SAMUEL PUTNAM 1830]

A time-honored tradition in money management

Since 1937, our values have been rooted in a profound sense of
responsibility for the money entrusted to us.

A prudent approach to investing

We use a research-driven team approach to seek consistent, dependable,
superior investment results over time, although there is no guarantee a
fund will meet its objectives.

Funds for every investment goal

We offer a broad range of mutual funds and other financial products so

Message from the Trustees

Dear Fellow Shareholder

We want you to know that Putnam Investments' management team, under the
leadership of Chief Executive Officer Ed Haldeman, continues to focus on
investment performance and remains committed to putting the interests of
shareholders first. In keeping with these goals, we have redesigned and
expanded our shareholder reports to make it easier for you to learn more
about your fund. Furthermore, on page 17 we provide information about the
2005 approval by the Trustees of your fund's management contract with
Putnam, including the amendment to the contract that was also approved by
fund shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting.

On page 82 of this report, you will find information about the outcome of
votes by shareholders at your fund's annual meeting, which was held on
July 14, 2005. At the meeting, fund shareholders voted, consistent with
the recommendation of your fund's Trustees, against a proposal to convert
your fund to an open-end investment company. Fewer than 11% of outstanding
shares were voted in favor of the proposal. Voting on this proposal was
triggered by the trading discount of your fund's shares at the close of
the fund's 2004 fiscal year. The Trustees' recommendation for the 2005
meeting was based on their view that your fund's closed-end status affords
it significant investment benefits and reflected their belief that the
current discount level did not justify the fundamental changes and
associated risks that would have resulted from a conversion. Your fund's
Trustees will continue to monitor the fund's discount trading pattern.

We would also like to take this opportunity to announce the retirement of
one of your fund's Trustees, Ronald J. Jackson, who has been an
independent Trustee of the Putnam funds since 1996. We thank him for his
service.

In the following pages, members of your fund's management team discuss the
fund's performance, strategies, and their outlook for the months ahead. As
always, we thank you for your support of the Putnam funds.

Respectfully yours,

/S/GEORGE PUTNAM, III

Putnam Premier Income Trust is designed for investors seeking a high level
of current income. The fund maintains flexibility across three sectors --
U.S. government and agencies, high-yield corporate, and international -- to
seek maximum current income without undue risk to capital. The fund may be
appropriate for investors seeking a higher level of income who can accept
a moderately higher level of risk.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights

* During its fiscal year ended July 31, 2005, Putnam Premier Income
  Trust had a total return at net asset value (NAV) of 10.00%. The fund's
  return at market price was 8.35%.

* The fund's primary benchmark, the Lehman Government Bond Index,
  returned 4.39%. The average return of the fund's Lipper category, Flexible
  Income Funds (closed-end), was 11.43%.

* In February 2005, Putnam Master Income Trust was merged into your
  fund. See page 9 for details.

* The fund's monthly dividend was reduced to $0.03 per share, effective
  May 2005. See page 9 for details.

* Additional fund performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data
  can be found in the performance section beginning on page 11.


- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance

It is important to note that a fund's performance at market price may
differ from its results at NAV. Although market price performance
generally reflects investment results, it may also be influenced by
several other factors, including changes in investor perceptions of the
fund or its investment advisor, market conditions, fluctuations in supply
and demand for the fund's shares, and changes in fund distributions.

Total return for periods ended 7/31/05

Since the fund's inception (2/29/88), average annual return is 8.44% at
NAV and 7.21% at market price.

Report from the fund managers

The year in review

During the past 12 months, shorter-maturity bond yields have risen as the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has continued its gradual series of
interest-rate increases. Yields on longer-term bonds fluctuated
significantly during the year, but ended the period with little change. As
a result, much of your fund's strength was apparent during the first half
of the period, when long-term bond yields declined. The second half was
considerably more volatile, as investors became concerned about stronger
economic growth leading to an increase in inflation. The fund's
diversified global portfolio -- and, in particular, its emphasis on
European bonds -- helped it to outperform its benchmark index, but our
reduction of the fund's exposure to high-yield and emerging-market bonds
detracted from returns, causing it to underperform its Lipper category.
The fund's currency strategy did not have a significant impact on returns
during the period.

Market overview

Global bond markets enjoyed a favorable set of circumstances during the
first half of the fiscal year, but there was significantly higher
volatility in the second half. From August 2004 through January 2005, most
bond sectors produced positive returns, with the riskier sectors --
including corporate high-yield bonds and emerging-market bonds --
continuing to outperform the higher-quality investment-grade corporate,
government, and agency sectors. While short-term interest rates generally
increased during the first half, long-term bond rates declined as foreign
countries and institutional investors bought long-term Treasuries.
Emerging markets benefited from high energy and commodities prices, solid
economic growth, and an overall reduction of perceived risk, while
high-yield bonds continued to perform well due to low default rates and
solid economic growth.

In the second half of the period, from February through July 2005, global
bond markets became more volatile as investors became more concerned about
strong global growth, record-high energy prices, and the potential for
higher inflation. At its meetings in January, February, and March, the Fed
changed its tone to reflect its own concerns about inflation. Investors
interpreted this as an indication that future rate increases could be more
frequent and higher, and bonds sold off sharply. Lower-quality,
higher-yielding bond sectors -- including emerging markets and high-yield
corporates -- experienced the greatest price declines (and yield
increases).

The market's decline proved overblown, however, and bond markets -- led by
the United States -- staged a significant rally from March through the end
of May, bringing the 10-year Treasury yield below 4.00%. As the period
came to a close, reports of stronger economic growth once again caused
prices to decline (and yields to rise).

Strategy overview

During this past year, we have continued to reduce the level of credit
risk in the portfolio. This detracted from the fund's relative performance
as high-yield bonds generally performed well over the period.
Nevertheless, we believe the strategy makes sense from a longer-term
perspective, as we feel that the economic fundamentals will probably not
support the outperformance of high-yield bonds over the next several
years. The fund was also slightly underweighted in emerging-market
bonds relative to many of its peers. This also detracted from relative
returns.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market sector performance

These indexes provide an overview of performance in different market
sectors for the 12 months ended 7/31/05.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonds

Lehman Government Bond Index (U.S. Treasury and agency
securities)                                                           4.39%

bonds)                                                               10.37%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JP Morgan Global Diversified Emerging Markets Bond Index
(global emerging-market bonds)                                       15.57%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equities
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S&P 500 Index (broad stock market)                                   14.05%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MSCI EAFE Index (international stocks)                               21.06%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Russell 2000 Index (small-company stocks)                            24.78%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another key component of our strategy was to reduce the portfolio's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates by shortening its overall
duration. Duration, which is measured in years, is the primary indicator
of interest-rate sensitivity. The shorter a bond's duration, the less
sensitive its price will be to interest-rate changes. The fund's shorter
duration hurt its relative returns when the market rallied, as it did
during the first half of the period and again from March through May 2005.
This strategy was very helpful, however, during the market's sharp decline
from February through March 2005.

With short-term interest rates continuing to rise, we increased the
fund's position in bank loans (included in the "high-yield" sector in the
chart below). We also continued to favor international bonds from
developed countries, especially in Europe.

Your fund's holdings

The fund's fiscal year was generally marked by interest-rate fluctuations
within a relatively moderate range, although volatility increased from
February through May 2005. In this environment, the fund's holdings of
securitized bonds, or structured securities, performed well because they
generally were of shorter durations than corporate bonds. As interest
rates rose, we were able to reinvest the assets in higher-yielding
securities. The fund's securitized holdings included mortgage-backed
securities (MBSs), such as those issued by the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae) and the Govern ment National Mortgage Association
(Ginnie Mae). Other types of securitized bonds included asset-backed
securities (ABSs), backed by car loans, home equity loans, and credit card
payments, and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), backed by
loans on large commercial real estate projects. During the period, the
fund's holdings of ABSs, CMBSs, and MBSs backed by adjustable-rate
mortgages all made solid contributions to performance.

Comparison of top sector weightings

[GRAPHIC OMITTED: bar chart COMPARISON OF TOP SECTOR WEIGHTINGS]

This chart shows how the fund's top weightings have changed over the last
six months. Weightings are shown as a percentage of net assets. Holdings
will vary over time.

                            as of 1/31/05          as of 7/31/05

U.S. investment
grade                           40.9%                  42.9%

High yield                      42.1%                  34.6%

International*                  17.0%                  22.5%

* Includes emerging-market holdings.

Treasury bonds generally underperformed during the period. The fund was
underweighted in this sector compared to many of its peers, so this
positioning was generally helpful for relative returns. European
government bonds made a substantial contribution to returns during the
period, benefiting from slowing growth in Europe and expectations that
these low growth rates would continue through the end of 2005. When U.S.
bond markets sold off in February and March 2005, European government
bonds outperformed by a considerable margin. Because the fund was
overweighted in these securities, particularly those issued by the
governments of Germany, France, and Sweden, this positioning bolstered
its relative returns.

While the fund remains significantly underweighted -- relative to its peer
group -- in emerging-market securities, we added some emerging-market bonds
during the period, because they offered better valuations than similarly
rated high-yield corporate bonds. We emphasized bonds from Brazil, Mexico,
and Russia, while reducing exposure in Colombia. We also eliminated the
fund's position in Turkey.

In the high-yield corporate bond portion of the fund, we continued to
favor bonds issued by wireless telecommunications companies, including
Nextel Communications, because of strong subscriber growth, attractive
valuations, and industry consolidation. We also emphasized energy
companies, including Dresser Inc., a large manufacturer of energy
exploration equipment. In this sector, the fund's holdings of Star Gas
Partners detracted from performance. This company, a distributor of home
heating oil in New England, was hurt by operational issues and rising oil
prices. Nevertheless, we are still positive about its prospects and
maintained the position.

We increased the fund's holdings of senior-secured bank loans during the
period. These loans carry floating interest rates, which means they reset
to reflect changes in short-term interest rates, which can be beneficial
if rates rise. Each of these loans is generally fully backed by the
issuing company's assets, such as plants, equipment, and inventory.
Moreover, senior-secured loan lenders are entitled to be paid before any
non-secured debt holder in the event of a liquidation of the company's
assets due to bankruptcy.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in
the future.

Of special interest

Merger with Putnam Master Income Trust completed

During the period, shareholders of Putnam Master Income Trust and Putnam
Premier Income Trust approved a merger of Putnam Master Income Trust into
Putnam Premier Income Trust, and the merger was completed on February 28,
2005. In connection with the merger, Putnam Premier Income Trust made a
special dividend distribution in the amount of $0.065 per share. The
merger, which occurred on February 25, 2005, is expected to result in
lower expenses for shareholders of each fund due to the larger asset base
of the combined fund.

Fund's dividend reduced

As short-term interest rates have been increasing, the cost of supporting
preferred shares has risen. The portfolio has also decreased its
allocation to high-yield in favor of higher-rated securities to become
more defensive in a rising interest-rate environment. Consequently, the
fund's monthly dividend was reduced from $0.039 to $0.03 per share,
effective with the May 2005 payment.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
teams' plans for responding to them.

The past two years have seen strong returns in the emerging and high-yield
corporate bond markets, reflecting a general global economic recovery.
During the second half of the period, however, investors developed a more
cautious view of the bond market based on a maturing global economic
recovery and the realization that short-term interest rates would probably
continue to increase through the end of the year. Our forecast is for a
continuation of steady, moderate growth with a slight increase in
inflation. Such an environment would probably be consistent with more
short-term interest-rate increases by the Fed and would eventually push
long-term bond yields upward. If these events transpire, we believe the
fund's shorter duration and higher credit quality should help protect the
value of its investments.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. International
investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, economic
instability, and political developments. Additional risks may be
associated with emerging-market securities, including illiquidity and
volatility. Mutual funds that invest in bonds are subject to certain
risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation risk. As
interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds are more
exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike bonds, bond
funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher
yields in return for more risk. Mutual funds that invest in government
securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to
prepayment risk.

Trustee approval of management contract

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General conclusions

The Board of Trustees of the Putnam funds oversees the management of each
fund and, as required by law, determines annually whether to approve the
continuance of your fund's management contract with Putnam Management and
its sub-management contract with Putnam Management's affiliate, Putnam
Investments Limited ("PIL"). In this regard, the Board of Trustees, with
the assistance of its Contract Committee consisting solely of Trustees who
are not "interested persons" (as such term is defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) of the Putnam funds (the
"Independent Trustees"), requests and evaluates all information it deems
reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Over the course of several
months beginning in March and ending in June 2005, the Contract Committee
met five times to consider the information provided by Putnam Management
and other information developed with the assistance of the Board's
independent counsel and independent staff. The Contract Committee reviewed
and discussed key aspects of this information with all of the Independent
Trustees. Upon completion of this review, the Contract Committee
recommended and the Independent Trustees approved the continuance of your
fund's management contract and sub-management contract, effective July 1,
2005. Because PIL is an affiliate of Putnam Management and Putnam
Management remains fully responsible for all services provided by PIL, the
Trustees have not evaluated PIL as a separate entity and all subsequent
references to Putnam Management below should be deemed to include
reference to PIL as necessary or appropriate in the context.

This approval was based on the following conclusions:

* That the fee schedule currently in effect for your fund, subject to
  certain changes noted below, represents reasonable compensation in light
  of the nature and quality of the services being provided to the fund, the
  fees paid by competitive funds and the costs incurred by Putnam Management
  in providing such services, and

* That such fee schedule represents an appropriate sharing between fund
  shareholders and Putnam Management of such economies of scale as may exist
  in the management of the fund at current asset levels.

These conclusions were based on a comprehensive consideration of all
information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any single
factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the Trustees'
deliberations and how the Trustees considered these factors are described
below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information
presented differently, giving different weights to various factors. It is
also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for your fund and
the other Putnam funds are the result of many years of review and
discussion between the Independent Trustees and Putnam Management, that
certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some
years than others, and that the Trustees' conclusions may be based, in
part, on their consideration of these same arrangements in prior years.


- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model fee schedules and categories; total expenses

The Trustees' review of the management fees and total expenses of the
Putnam funds focused on three major themes:

* Consistency. The Trustees, working in cooperation with Putnam
  Management, have developed and implemented a series of model fee schedules
  for the Putnam funds designed to ensure that each fund's management fee is
  consistent with the fees for similar funds in the Putnam family of funds
  and compares favorably with fees paid by competitive funds sponsored by
  other investment advisers. Under this approach, each Putnam fund is
  assigned to one of several fee categories based on a combination of
  factors, including competitive fees and perceived difficulty of
  management, and a common fee schedule is implemented for all funds in a
  given fee category. The Trustees reviewed the model fee schedule currently
  in effect for the Putnam funds, including fee levels and breakpoints, and
  the assignment of each fund to a particular fee category under this
  structure. ("Breakpoints" refer to reductions in fee rates that apply to
  additional assets once specified asset levels are reached.)

Since their inception, Putnam's closed-end funds have generally had
management fees that are higher than those of Putnam's open-end funds
pursuing comparable investment strategies. These differences ranged from
five to 20 basis points. The Trustees have reexamined this matter and
recommend that these differences be conformed to a uniform five basis
points. Under the new fee schedule, the fund pays a quarterly fee to
Putnam Management at the following rates:

  0.75% of the first $500 million of the fund's average weekly assets
  (as described below);
  0.65% of the next $500 million;
  0.60% of the next $500 million;
  0.55% of the next $5 billion;
  0.525% of the next $5 billion;
  0.505% of the next $5 billion;
  0.49% of the next $5 billion;
  0.48% of the next $5 billion;
  0.47% of the next $5 billion;
  0.46% of the next $5 billion;
  0.45% of the next $5 billion;
  0.44% of the next $5 billion;
  0.43% of the next $5 billion; and
  0.42% thereafter

Based on net asset levels as of June 30, 2005, the new fee schedule for
your fund will not change the management fees, as a percentage of the
fund's average weekly assets, currently paid by common shareholders. The
Trustees approved the new fee schedules for the funds effective as of
January 1, 2006, in order to provide Putnam Management an opportunity to
accommodate the impact on revenues in its budget process for the coming
year.

* Competitiveness. The Trustees also reviewed comparative fee and expense
  information for competitive funds, which indicated that, in a custom peer
  group of competitive funds selected by Lipper Inc., your fund ranked in
  the 33rd percentile in management fees and in the 67th percentile in total
  expenses as of December 31, 2004 (the first percentile being the least
  expensive funds and the 100th percentile being the most expensive funds).
  The Trustees expressed their intention to monitor this information closely
  to ensure that fees and expenses of the Putnam funds continue to meet
  evolving competitive standards.

* Economies of scale. The Trustees concluded that the fee schedule
  currently in effect for your fund represents an appropriate sharing of
  economies of scale at current asset levels. Your fund currently has the
  benefit of breakpoints in its management fee that provide shareholders
  with significant economies of scale, which means that the effective
  management fee rate of a fund (as a percentage of fund assets) declines as
  a fund grows in size and crosses specified asset thresholds. The Trustees
  examined the existing breakpoint structure of the Putnam funds' management
  fees in light of competitive industry practices. The Trustees considered
  various possible modifications to the Putnam funds' current breakpoint
  structure, but ultimately concluded that the current breakpoint structure
  continues to serve the interests of fund shareholders. Accordingly, the
  Trustees continue to believe that the fee schedules currently in effect
  for the funds represent an appropriate sharing of economies of scale at
  current asset levels.

In connection with their review of the management fees and total expenses
of the Putnam funds, the Trustees also reviewed the costs of the services
to be provided and profits to be realized by Putnam Management and its
affiliates from the relationship with the funds. This information included
trends in revenues, expenses and profitability of Putnam Management and
its affiliates relating to the investment management and distribution
services provided to the funds. In this regard, the Trustees also reviewed
an analysis of Putnam Management's revenues, expenses and profitability
with respect to the funds' management contracts, allocated on a
fund-by-fund basis.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment performance

The quality of the investment process provided by Putnam Management
represented a major factor in the Trustees' evaluation of the quality of
services provided by Putnam Management under your fund's management
contract. The Trustees were assisted in their review of the funds'
investment process and performance by the work of the Investment Oversight
Committees of the Trustees, which meet on a regular monthly basis with the
funds' portfolio teams throughout the year. The Trustees concluded that
Putnam Management generally provides a high quality investment process --
as measured by the experience and skills of the individuals assigned to
the management of fund portfolios, the resources made available to
such personnel, and in general the ability of Putnam Management to attract
and retain high-quality personnel -- but also recognize that this does not
guarantee favorable investment results for every fund in every time
period. The Trustees considered the investment performance of each fund
over multiple time periods and considered information comparing the fund's
performance with various benchmarks and with the performance of
competitive funds. The Trustees noted the satisfactory investment
performance of many Putnam funds. They also noted the disappointing
investment performance of certain funds in recent years and continued to
discuss with senior management of Putnam Management the factors
contributing to such underperformance and actions being taken to improve
performance. The Trustees recognized that, in recent years, Putnam
Management has made significant changes in its investment personnel and
processes and in the fund product line to address areas of
underperformance. The Trustees indicated their intention to continue to
monitor performance trends to assess the effectiveness of these changes
and to evaluate whether additional remedial changes are warranted.

In the case of your fund, the Trustees considered that your fund's common
share performance at net asset value was in the following percentiles of
its Lipper Inc. peer group for the one-, three- and five-year periods
ended December 31, 2004 (the first percentile being the best performing
funds and the 100th percentile being the worst performing funds):

               One-year period     Three-year period      Five-year period
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     37th                 28th                  28th

(Because of the passage of time, these performance results may differ from
the performance results for more recent periods shown elsewhere in this
report.)

As a general matter, the Trustees believe that cooperative efforts between
the Trustees and Putnam Management represent the most effective way to
address investment performance problems. The Trustees believe that
investors in the Putnam funds have, in effect, placed their trust in the
Putnam organization, under the oversight of the funds' Trustees, to make
appropriate decisions regarding the management of the funds. Based on the
responsiveness of Putnam Management in the recent past to Trustee concerns
about investment performance, the Trustees believe that it is preferable
to seek change within Putnam Management to address performance
shortcomings. In the Trustees' view, the alternative of terminating a
management contract and engaging a new investment adviser for an
underperforming fund would entail significant disruptions and would not
provide any greater assurance of improved investment performance.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brokerage and soft-dollar allocations; other benefits

The Trustees considered various potential benefits that Putnam Management
may receive in connection with the services it provides under the
management contract with your fund. These include principally benefits
related to brokerage and soft-dollar allocations, whereby a portion of the
commissions paid by a fund for brokerage is earmarked to pay for research
services that may be utilized by a fund's investment adviser. The Trustees
believe that soft-dollar credits and other potential benefits associated
with the allocation of fund brokerage, which pertains mainly to funds
investing in equity securities, represent assets of the funds that should
be used for the benefit of fund shareholders. This area has been marked by
significant change in recent years. In July 2003, acting upon the Contract
Committee's recommendation, the Trustees directed that allocations of
brokerage to reward firms that sell fund shares be discontinued no later
than December 31, 2003. In addition, commencing in 2004, the allocation of
brokerage commissions by Putnam Management to acquire research services
from third-party service providers has been significantly reduced, and
continues at a modest level only to acquire research that is customarily
not available for cash. The Trustees will continue to monitor the
allocation of the funds' brokerage to ensure that the principle of "best
price and execution" remains paramount in the portfolio trading process.

The Trustees' annual review of your fund's management contract also
included the review of your fund's custodian agreement with Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company which provides benefits to affiliates of Putnam
Management.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison of retail and institutional fee schedules

The information examined by the Trustees as part of their annual contract
review has included for many years information regarding fees charged by
Putnam Management and its affiliates to institutional clients such as
defined benefit pension plans, college endowments, etc. This information
included comparison of such fees with fees charged to the funds, as well
as a detailed assessment of the differences in the services provided to
these two types of clients. The Trustees observed, in this regard, that
the differences in fee rates between institutional clients and the mutual
funds are by no means uniform when examined by individual asset sectors,
suggesting that differences in the pricing of investment management
services to these types of clients reflect to a substantial degree
historical competitive forces operating in separate market places. The
Trustees considered the fact that fee rates across all asset sectors are
higher on average for mutual funds than for institutional clients, as well
as the differences between the services that Putnam Management provides to
the Putnam funds and those that it provides to institutional clients of
the firm, but have not relied on such comparisons to any significant
extent in concluding that the management fees paid by your fund are
reasonable.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approval of amended and restated management contract in July 2005

In July 2005, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees of your
fund, approved an amendment to your fund's management contract to take
into account investment leverage in calculating management fees. The
Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, have concluded
that it would be in the best interest of your fund and its common
shareholders to compensate Putnam Management on the basis of its "average
weekly assets," rather than its net assets. "Average weekly assets" is
defined as the difference (as measured on a weekly basis) between the
fund's total assets (including assets attributable to leverage for
investment purposes) and its total liabilities (excluding liabilities
attributable to leverage for investment purposes). This formulation
effectively allows for Putnam Management to receive management fees on
leveraged assets. In the course of their evaluation, the Trustees
considered the benefit to your fund from the additional investment
management services that Putnam Management would perform in connection
with a leveraged investment strategy, as well as the amount of
compensation Putnam Management would receive under the proposed fee
structure.

The Trustees noted that the proposed amendment would align the fee
arrangements for your fund with those of other closed-end Putnam funds
that currently engage in leverage for investment purposes. Furthermore,
the Trustees were advised by Putnam Management that it is a customary and
widespread practice in the closed-end fund industry to structure leveraged
products in a manner that compensates advisors for their management of the
assets acquired through leverage.

In evaluating the incentives and potential conflicts of interest created
by an average weekly assets-based fee, the Trustees considered that the
asset coverage restrictions under the 1940 Act, as well as other legal
requirements, limit the extent to which a manager can expose a fund to
additional risk through leverage. Furthermore, the Trustees considered the
advantages of a management fee reduction mechanism that is included in the
amended contract, which reduces the management fee dollar for dollar
(subject to a specified maximum reduction) where the costs of carrying
investment leverage outweigh the benefits (in terms of net income and
short-term capital gains) to common shareholders from managing additional
investment assets. In the event that your fund actually engages in
leverage, the Trustees will have the opportunity, through regular reports
from Putnam Management prepared in connection with the fee reduction
mechanism described above, to continue monitoring the conflict of interest
between Putnam Management and your fund.

The Trustees approved the proposed changes to your fund's management
contract in principle at a meeting held on April 15, 2005, and further
confirmed their approval in principle by written consent of a majority of
the Trustees (including a majority of the Independent Trustees) dated May
18, 2005. Shareholders of your fund approved the amended and restated
management contract at the fund's annual meeting of shareholders on July
14, 2005. The Trustees confirmed their action by written consent at an
in-person meeting as required under the 1940 Act prior to the execution of
the amended management contract.

The Trustees also approved conforming changes to the sub-management
contract between Putnam Management and PIL with respect to your fund, to
provide for PIL's fee to be calculated on the basis of the fund's average
weekly assets. The fee paid under the sub-management contract is paid by
Putnam Management and not by your fund. Under the circumstances, the
changes to the sub-management contract did not require shareholder
approval.

Financial statements

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A guide to financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,  preceded
by the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, constitute
the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values as
of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by asset
type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of concentration
and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss. This
is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from dividends and
interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses to determine net
investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss the fund realized
on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any unrealized gains or losses
over the period -- is added to or subtracted from the net investment result
to determine the fund's net gain or loss for the fiscal year.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by the fund's net investment gain or loss, by distributions to
shareholders, and by changes in the number of the fund's shares. It lists
distributions and their sources (net investment income or realized capital
gains) over the current reporting period and the most recent fiscal
year-end. The distributions listed here may not match the sources listed
in the Statement of operations because the distributions are determined on
a tax basis and may be paid in a different period from the one in which
they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment results,
per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment income ratios,
and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting the five most
recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the highlight table also
includes the current reporting period. For open-end funds, a separate
table is provided for each share class.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Putnam Premier Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Putnam Premier Income Trust, including the fund's portfolio, as of July
31, 2005, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended,
the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years
in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
July 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other
appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Putnam Premier Income Trust as of July 31, 2005, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to financial statements 7/31/05

Note 1: Significant accounting policies

Putnam Premier Income Trust (the "fund"), a Massachusetts business trust,
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The fund's
investment objective is to seek high current income consistent with the
preservation of capital by allocating its investments among the U.S.
government sector, high yield sector and international sector of the
fixed-income securities market. The fund invests in higher yielding,
lower-rated bonds that have a higher rate of default due to the nature of
the investments.

In the normal course of business, the fund enters into contracts that may
include agreements to indemnify another party under given circumstances.
The fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be, but have not yet been, made
against the fund. However, the fund expects the risk of material loss to
be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements is in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the last reported sales price on their principal
exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no sales are
reported -- as in the case of some securities traded over-the-counter -- a
security is valued at its last reported bid price. Market quotations are
not considered to be readily available for certain debt obligations; such
investments are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by an
independent pricing service or dealers, approved by the Trustees. Such
services or dealers determine valuations for normal institutional-size
trading units of such securities using methods based on market
transactions for comparable securities and various relationships,
generally recognized by institutional traders, between securities. Many
securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for
securities in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect
events that occur after such close but before the close of the New York
Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain days, the fund will fair value
foreign securities taking into account multiple factors, including
movements in the U.S. securities markets. The number of days on which fair
value prices will be used will depend on market activity and it is
possible that fair value prices will be used by the fund to a significant
extent. Securities quoted in foreign currencies are translated into U.S.
dollars at the current exchange rate. Short-term investments having
remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost,
which approximates fair value. Other investments, including certain
restricted securities, are valued at fair value following procedures
approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account Pursuant to an exemptive order from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund may transfer uninvested cash
balances, including cash collateral received under security lending
arrangements, into a joint trading account along with the cash of other
registered investment companies and certain other accounts managed by
Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's
manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. These
balances may be invested in issues of high-grade short-term investments
having maturities of up to 397 days for collateral received under security
lending arrangements and up to 90 days for other cash investments.

C) Repurchase agreements The fund, or any joint trading account, through
its custodian, receives delivery of the underlying securities, the market
value of which at the time of purchase is required to be in an amount at
least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest. Collateral
for certain tri-party repurchase agreements is held at the counterparty's
custodian in a segregated account for the benefit of the fund and the
counterparty. Putnam Management is responsible for determining that the
value of these underlying securities is at all times at least equal to the
resale price, including accrued interest.

D) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell
is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on the
identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income, net of
applicable withholding taxes, is recognized on the ex-dividend date,
except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recognized as
soon as the fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends,
if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received.
All premiums/discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity
basis.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or forward commitment or
delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after the trade
date; interest income is accrued based on the terms of the securities.
Losses may arise due to changes in the market value of the underlying
securities or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

The fund earned certain fees in connection with its senior loan purchasing
activities. These fees are treated as market discount and are recorded as
income in the statement of operations.

E) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The fund
does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or losses
resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on investments from
fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of the securities.
Such gains and losses are included with the net realized and unrealized
gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions represent net realized exchange gains or losses on
closed forward currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies,
currency gains and losses realized between the trade and settlement dates
on securities transactions and the difference between the amount of
investment income and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the fund's
books and the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts actually received or paid.
Net unrealized appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward
currency contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at
the period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments
in foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

F) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted (or
an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund intends
to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and short term
investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency contracts is
determined using current forward currency exchange rates supplied by a
quotation service. The market value of the contract will fluctuate with
changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is marked to market daily
and the change in market value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss.
When the contract is closed, the fund records a realized gain or loss
equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it
was opened and the value at the time it was closed. The fund could be
exposed to risk if the value of the currency changes unfavorably, if the
counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the terms of their
contracts or if the fund is unable to enter into a closing position. Risks
may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities.
Forward currency contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

G) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on securities
it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures and
options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the hedged
instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the value of
the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for
the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is unable to
perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets
and liabilities. When the contract is closed, the fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at
the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Realized
gains and losses on purchased options are included in realized gains and
losses on investment securities. If a written call option is exercised,
the premium originally received is recorded as an addition to sales
proceeds. If a written put option is exercised, the premium originally
received is recorded as a reduction to the cost of investments.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the
value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
"variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last sale
price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for purchased
options and the last ask price for written options. Options traded
over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers. Futures and
written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

H) Interest rate swap contracts The fund may enter into interest rate swap
contracts, which are arrangements between two parties to exchange cash
flows based on a notional principal amount, to manage the fund's exposure
to interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are marked to market daily
based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is
recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made are
recorded as realized gains or loss. The fund could be exposed to credit or
market risk due to unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest
rates or if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to perform. Risk
of loss may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Interest rate swap contracts outstanding at period end, if
any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

I) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront or
periodic payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange
for the right to receive a contingent payment. The maximum amount of the
payment may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index or
security as a result of a related credit event. An upfront payment
received by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a liability
on the fund's books. An upfront payment made by the fund, as the
protection buyer, is recorded as an asset on the fund's books. Periodic
payments received or paid by the fund are recorded as realized gains or
losses. The credit default contracts are marked to market daily based upon
quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is recorded as
unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a result of a credit
event or termination of the contract are recognized, net of a proportional
amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses. In addition to
bearing the risk that the credit event will occur, the fund could be
exposed to market risk due to unfavorable changes in interest rates or in
the price of the underlying security or index, the possibility that the
fund may be unable to close out its position at the same time or at the
same price as if it had purchased comparable publicly traded securities or
that the counterparty may default on its obligation to perform. Risks of
loss may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Credit default contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

J) TBA purchase commitments The fund may enter into "TBA" (to be
announced) commitments to purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a
future date beyond customary settlement time. Although the unit price has
been established, the principal value has not been finalized. However, the
amount of the commitments will not significantly differ from the principal
amount. The fund holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or
high-grade debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase
price, or the fund may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward
sale of other securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be
earned until settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered
securities themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the
security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date, which risk
is in addition to the risk of decline in the value of the fund's other
assets. Unsettled TBA purchase commitments are valued at fair value of the
underlying securities, according to the procedures described under
"Security valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market" daily and
the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an unrealized gain
or loss.

Although the fund will generally enter into TBA purchase commitments with
the intention of acquiring securities for its portfolio or for delivery
pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, the fund may dispose of
a commitment prior to settlement if Putnam Management deems it appropriate
to do so.

K) Dollar rolls To enhance returns, the fund may enter into dollar rolls
(principally using TBAs) in which the fund sells securities for delivery
in the current month and simultaneously contracts to purchase similar
securities on a specified future date. During the period between the sale
and subsequent purchase, the fund will not be entitled to receive income
and principal payments on the securities sold. The fund will, however,
retain the difference between the initial sales price and the forward
price for the future purchase. The fund will also be able to earn interest
on the cash proceeds that are received from the initial sale. The fund may
be exposed to market or credit risk if the price of the security changes
unfavorably or the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the
agreement.

L) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of securities
loaned is determined daily and any additional required collateral is
allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk of borrower
default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will bear the risk of
loss with respect to the investment of the cash collateral. Income from
securities lending is included in investment income on the statement of
operations. At July 31, 2005, the value of securities loaned amounted to
$1,022,665. The fund received cash collateral of $1,049,814 which is
pooled with collateral of other Putnam funds into 26 issues of high grade
short-term investments.

M) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable to
regulated investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to
distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At July 31, 2005, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $289,635,841
available to the extent allowed by the Code to offset future net capital
gain, if any. This amount includes $68,606,363 of capital losses acquired
in connection with the acquisition of Putnam Master Income Trust which are
subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of
the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover       Expiration
- ----------------------------------
   $14,335,502       July 31, 2006
    37,732,461       July 31, 2007
    60,809,014       July 31, 2008
    51,721,443       July 31, 2009
    44,917,486       July 31, 2010
    80,119,935       July 31, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending July 31, 2006, $1,707,863 of losses recognized during the period
November 1, 2004 to July 31, 2005 a portion of which could be limited by
Section 381 of the Code.

N) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend
date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of income and
gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles.

These differences include temporary and permanent differences of losses on
wash sale transactions, foreign currency gains and losses, post-October
loss deferrals, nontaxable dividends, dividends payable, defaulted bond
interest, unrealized and realized gains and losses on certain futures
contracts, market discount, interest on payment-in-kind securities and
income on swap contracts. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations. For the
year ended July 31, 2005, the fund reclassified $20,772,724 to decrease
distributions in excess of net investment income and $11,231,260 to
decrease paid-in-capital, with an increase to accumulated net realized
losses of $9,541,464.

The tax basis components of distributable earnings and the federal tax
cost as of period end were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation           $51,408,977
Unrealized depreciation           (40,905,744)
                                 ------------
Net unrealized appreciation        10,503,233
Undistributed ordinary income      21,133,360
Capital loss carryforward        (289,635,841)
Post-October Loss                  (1,707,863)
Cost for federal income tax
purposes                       $1,476,636,654


Note 2: Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory services
quarterly based on the "average weekly assets" of the fund. "Average
weekly assets" is defined to mean the average of the weekly determinations
of the difference between the total assets of the fund (including any
assets attributable to leverage for investment purposes though incurrence
of indebtedness) and the total liabilities of the fund (excluding
liabilities incurred in connection with leverage for investment purposes).
This fee is based on the following annual rates: 0.75% of the first
$500 million of average weekly assets, 0.65% of the next $500 million,
0.60% of the next $500 million and 0.55% thereafter.

In June 2005, the Trustees and Putnam Management agreed to a reduced
management fee structure for the fund that will go into effect on January
1, 2006. Based on the fund's current asset levels, this new fee structure
is not expected to have an effect on the fund's effective management fee
rate. However, the new fee structure incorporates additional breakpoints
at higher asset levels.

Effective September 13, 2004, Putnam Investments Limited ("PIL"), an
affiliate of Putnam Management, is authorized by the Trustees to manage a
separate portion of the assets of the fund as determined by Putnam
Management from time to time. Putnam Management pays a quarterly
sub-management fee to PIL for its services at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the average weekly assets (calculated in the same manner as under the
fund's management contract with Putnam Management) of the portion of the
fund managed by PIL.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The aggregate
amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam Fiduciary
Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. PFTC receives fees
for custody services based on the fund's asset level, the number of its
security holdings and transaction volumes. Putnam Investor Services, a
division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent functions to the fund.
Putnam Investor Services is paid a monthly fee for investor servicing at
an annual rate of 0.05% of the fund's average net assets. During the year
ended July 31, 2005, the fund paid PFTC $981,614 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the year ended July 31, 2005, the
fund's expenses were reduced by $223,204 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $449, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings. George
Putnam III, who is not an independent Trustee, also receives the foregoing
fees for his services as Trustee.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with the
Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have served
as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension Plan are

the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense for the fund is
included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of
operations. Accrued pension liability is included in Payable for Trustee
compensation and expenses in the statement of assets and liabilities. The
Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with respect to any Trustee first

Note 3: Purchases and sales of securities

During the year ended July 31, 2005, cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of investment securities other than U.S. government securities and
short-term investments aggregated $1,383,690,573 and $1,405,532,120,
respectively. Purchases and sales of U.S. government securities aggregated
no monies and $21,926,797, respectively.

Note 4: Investment in Putnam Prime Money Market Fund

Pursuant to an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the fund invests in Putnam Prime Money Market Fund, an
open-end management investment company managed by Putnam Management.
Management fees paid by the fund are reduced by an amount equal to the
management and administrative services fees paid by Putnam Prime Money
Market Fund with respect to assets invested by the fund in Putnam Prime
Money Market Fund. For the year ended July 31, 2005, management fees paid
were reduced by $228,558 relating to the fund's investment in Putnam Prime
Money Market Fund. Income distributions earned by the fund are recorded as
income in the statement of operations and totaled $3,665,474 for the
period ended July 31, 2005. During the year ended July 31, 2005, cost of
purchases and cost of sales of investments in Putnam Prime Money Market
Fund aggregated $637,317,042 and $616,212,425, respectively.

Note 5: Senior loan commitments

Senior loans are purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery
basis and may be settled a month or more after the trade date; interest
income is accrued based on the terms of the securities. Senior loans can
be acquired through an agent, by assignment from another holder of the
loan, or as a participation interest in another holder's portion of the
loan. When the fund invests in a loan or participation, the fund is
subject to the risk that an intermediate participant between the fund and
the borrower will fail to meet its obligations to the fund, in addition to
the risk that the borrower under the loan may default on its obligations.

Note 6: Regulatory matters and litigation

Putnam Management has entered into agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division settling
charges connected with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees
and, in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities
Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.
Pursuant to these settlement agreements, Putnam Management will pay a
total of $193.5 million in penalties and restitution, with $153.5 million
being paid to shareholders and the funds. The restitution amount will be
allocated to shareholders pursuant to a plan developed by an independent
consultant, with payments to shareholders following approval of the plan
by the SEC and the Massachusetts Securities Division.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's and Massachusetts Securities
Division's allegations and related matters also serve as the general basis
for numerous lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits filed
against Putnam Management and certain related parties, including certain
Putnam funds. Putnam Management will bear any costs incurred by Putnam
funds in connection with these lawsuits. Putnam Management believes that
the likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class
action lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the
fund is remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially
affect its ability to provide investment management services to its
clients, including the Putnam funds.

Putnam Management and Putnam Retail Management are named as defendants in
a civil suit in which the plaintiffs allege that the management and
distribution fees paid by certain Putnam funds were excessive and seek
recovery under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Putnam Management and
Putnam Retail Management have contested the plaintiffs' claims and the
matter is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Massachusetts. Based on currently available information, Putnam Management
believes that this action is without merit and that it is unlikely to have
a material effect on Putnam Management's and Putnam Retail Management's
ability to provide services to their clients, including the fund.

Item 2. Code of Ethics:
- -----------------------
(a) All officers of the Fund, including its principal executive, financial and
accounting officers, are employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC,
the Fund's investment manager.  As such they are subject to a comprehensive
Code of Ethics adopted and administered by Putnam Investments which is
designed to protect the interests of the firm and its clients.  The Fund
has adopted a Code of Ethics which incorporates the Code of Ethics of
Putnam Investments with respect to all of its officers and Trustees who are
employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC.  For this reason, the Fund
has not adopted a separate code of ethics governing its principal
executive, financial and accounting officers.

(c) In July 2004, Putnam Investment Management, LLC, the Fund's investment
manager, Putnam Retail Management Limited Partnership, the Fund's principal
underwriter, and Putnam Investments Limited, the sub-manager for a portion
of the assets of certain funds as determined by Putnam Management from time
to time, adopted several amendments to their Code of Ethics.  Some of these
amendments were adopted as a result of Putnam Investment Management's
partial settlement order with the SEC on November 13, 2003.  Insofar as such
Code of Ethics applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal
financial officer and principal accounting officer, the amendments provided
for the following:  (i) a 90-day blackout period for all shares of Putnam
open-end funds (except for money market funds) purchased or sold (including
exchanges into or out of a fund) by Putnam employees and certain family
members; (ii) a one-year holding period for all access persons that operates
in the same manner as the 90-day rule; (iii) delivery by Putnam employees to
the Code of Ethics Administrator of both quarterly account statements for
all brokerage accounts (irrespective of activity in the accounts) and
account statements for any Putnam funds not held at Putnam or for any funds
sub-advised by Putnam; (iv) a prohibition of Putnam employees from making
more than 25 trades in individual securities in their personal accounts in
any given quarter; (v) the extension of the existing prohibition of access
persons from a purchase and sale or sale and purchase of an individual
security within 60 days to include trading based on tax-lot election; (vi)
the inclusion of trades in Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (ultimate parent
company of Putnam Investment Management) securities in pre-clearance and
reporting requirements; (vii) a prohibition of limit and good-until-canceled
orders as inconsistent with the requirements of daily pre-clearance; (viii)
new limits and procedures for accounts managed by outside managers and
brokers, in order for trading in such accounts to be exempt from
pre-clearance requirements; (ix) a new gift and entertainment policy that
imposes a reporting obligation on all meals and entertainment and new limits
on non-meal entertainment; (x) a number of alternatives for the reporting of
irregular activity.

In December 2004, additional amendments to the Code of Ethics were adopted.
Insofar as such Code of Ethics applies to the Fund's principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the
amendments provided for the following:  (i) implementation of minimum
monetary sanctions for violations of the Code; (ii) expansion of the
definition of "access person" under the Code to include all Putnam employees
with access to non-public information regarding Putnam-managed mutual fund
portfolio holdings; (iii) lengthening the period during which access persons
are required to complete quarterly reports; (iv) reducing the maximum number
of trades than can be made by Putnam employees in their personal accounts in
any calendar quarter from 25 trades to 10 trades; and (v) lengthening the
required holding period for securities by access persons from 60 days to 90
days.

In March 2005, additional amendments to the Code of Ethics were adopted,
that went into effect on April 1, 2005.  Insofar as such Code of Ethics
applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer, the amendments (i) prohibit Putnam
employees and their immediate family members from having any direct or
indirect personal financial interest in companies that do business with
Putnam (excluding investment holdings in public companies that are not
material to the employee), unless such interest is disclosed and approved by
the Code of Ethics Officer; (ii) prohibit Putnam employees from using Putnam
assets, letterhead or other resources in making political or campaign
contributions, solicitations or endorsements;(iii) require Putnam employees
to obtain pre-clearance of personal political or campaign contributions or
other gifts to government officials or political candidates in certain
jurisdictions and to officials or candidates with whom Putnam has or is
seeking to establish a business relationship and (iv) require Putnam
employees to obtain pre-approval from Putnam's Director of Government
Relations prior to engaging in lobbying activities.

In July 2005, additional amendments to the Code of Ethics were adopted.
Insofar as such Code of Ethics applies to the Fund's principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the
amendments provided for an exception to the standard 90-day holding period
(one year, in the case of employees deemed to be "access persons" under the
Code) for shares of Putnam mutual funds in the case of redemptions from an
employee's account in a college savings plan qualified under Section 529 of
the Internal Revenue Code.  Under this exception, an employee may, without
penalty under the Code, make "qualified redemptions" of shares from such an
account less than 90 days (or one year, as applicable) after purchase.
"Qualified redemptions" include redemptions for higher education purposes
for the account beneficiary and redemptions made upon death or disability.
The July 2005 amendments also provide that an employee may, for purposes of
the rule limiting the number of trades per calendar quarter in an employee's
personal account to a maximum of 10, count all trades of the same security
in the same direction (all buys or all sells) over a period of five
consecutive business days as a single trade.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert:
- -----------------------------------------
The Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee is comprised solely of Trustees
who are "independent" (as such term has been defined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in regulations implementing Section 407
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the "Regulations")).  The Trustees believe
that each of the members of the Audit and Pricing Committee also possess
a combination of knowledge and experience with respect to financial
accounting matters, as well as other attributes, that qualify them for
service on the Committee.  In addition, the Trustees have determined
that all members of the Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee meet the
financial literacy requirements of the New York Stock Exchange's rules
and that Mr. Patterson, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Worley qualify as "audit
committee financial experts" (as such term has been defined by the
Regulations) based on their review of their pertinent experience and
education. Certain other Trustees, although not on the Audit and Pricing
Committee, would also qualify as "audit committee financial experts."
The SEC has stated that the designation or identification of a person
as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this Item 3 of Form
N-CSR does not impose on such person any duties, obligations or liability
that are greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on
such person as a member of the Audit and Pricing Committee and the Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services:
- -----------------------------------------------

The following table presents fees billed in each of the last two fiscal
years for services rendered to the fund by the fund's independent auditors:

                    Audit       Audit-Related   Tax       All Other
Fiscal year ended   Fees        Fees            Fees      Fees

July 31, 2005       $42,192     $18,000*        $4,192    $--
July 31, 2004       $40,150     $--             $4,150    $176

* Includes fees billed to the fund for services relating to one or more fund
mergers.  A portion of such fees was paid by Putnam Management.

For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005 and July 31, 2004, the fund's
independent auditors billed aggregate non-audit fees in the amounts of $
22,192 and $ 4,326 respectively, to the fund, Putnam Management and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Putnam
Management that provides ongoing services to the fund.

Audit Fees represents fees billed for the fund's last two fiscal years.

Audit-Related Fees represents fees billed in the fund's last two fiscal
years for services traditionally performed by the fund's auditor, including
accounting consultation for proposed transactions or concerning financial
accounting and reporting standards and other audit or attest services not
required by statute or regulation.

Tax Fees represent fees billed in the fund's last two fiscal years for tax
compliance, tax planning and tax advice services.  Tax planning and tax
advice services include assistance with tax audits, employee benefit plans
and requests for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities.

All Other Fees Fees represent fees billed for services relating to interfund
trading.

Pre-Approval Policies of the Audit and Pricing Committee.  The Audit and
Pricing Committee of the Putnam funds has determined that, as a matter of
policy, all work performed for the funds by the funds' independent auditors
will be pre-approved by the Committee and will generally not be subject to
pre-approval procedures.

Under certain circumstances, the Audit and Pricing Committee believes that
it may be appropriate for Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management") and certain of its affiliates to engage the services of the
funds' independent auditors, but only after prior approval by the Committee.
 Such requests are required to be submitted in writing to the Committee and
explain, among other things, the nature of the proposed engagement, the
estimated fees, and why this work must be performed by that particular audit
firm.  The Committee will review the proposed engagement at its next
meeting.

Since May 6, 2003, all work performed by the independent auditors for the
funds, Putnam Management and any entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with Putnam Management that provides ongoing services to the
fund was pre-approved by the Committee or a member of the Committee pursuant
to the pre-approval policies discussed above.  Prior to that date, the
Committee had a general policy to pre-approve the independent auditor's
engagements for non-audit services with the funds, Putnam Management and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Putnam
Management that provides ongoing services to the fund.

The following table presents fees billed by the fund's principal auditor for
services required to be approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Item 5.  Audit Committee
- ------------------------

(a)  The fund has a separately-designated audit committee
established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The Audit Committee of the fund's
Board of Trustees is composed of the following persons:

Myra R. Drucker
Paul L. Joskow (Chairperson)
Robert E. Patterson
W. Thomas Stephens
Richard B. Worley

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures For Closed-End
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Management Investment Companies:
        --------------------------------

Proxy voting guidelines of the Putnam funds
- -------------------------------------------

The proxy voting guidelines below summarize the funds' positions on
various issues of concern to investors, and give a general
indication of how fund portfolio securities will be voted on
proposals dealing with particular issues.  The funds' proxy voting
service is instructed to vote all proxies relating to fund portfolio
securities in accordance with these guidelines, except as otherwise
instructed by the Proxy Coordinator, a member of the Office of the
Trustees who is appointed to assist in the coordination and voting
of the funds' proxies.

The proxy voting guidelines are just that - guidelines.  The
guidelines are not exhaustive and do not include all potential
voting issues.  Because proxy issues and the circumstances of
individual companies are so varied, there may be instances when the
funds may not vote in strict adherence to these guidelines.  For
example, the proxy voting service is expected to bring to the Proxy
Coordinator's attention proxy questions that are company-specific
and of a non-routine nature and that, even if covered by the
guidelines, may be more appropriately handled on a case-by-case
basis.

Similarly, Putnam Management's investment professionals, as part of
their ongoing review and analysis of all fund portfolio holdings,
are responsible for monitoring significant corporate developments,
including proxy proposals submitted to shareholders, and notifying
the Proxy Coordinator of circumstances where the interests of fund
shareholders may warrant a vote contrary to these guidelines.  In
such instances, the investment professionals will submit a written
recommendation to the Proxy Coordinator and the person or persons
designated by Putnam Management's Legal and Compliance Department to
assist in processing referral items pursuant to the funds' "Proxy
Voting Procedures."  The Proxy Coordinator, in consultation with the
funds' Senior Vice President, Executive Vice President, and/or the
Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee, as appropriate,
will determine how the funds' proxies will be voted.  When
indicated, the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee
may consult with other members of the Committee or the full Board of
Trustees.

The following guidelines are grouped according to the types of
proposals generally presented to shareholders.  Part I deals with
proposals that have been put forth by management and approved and
recommended by a company's board of directors.  Part II deals with
proposals submitted by shareholders for inclusion in proxy
statements.  Part III addresses unique considerations pertaining to
non-U.S. issuers.

The Putnam funds will disclose their proxy votes in accordance with
the timetable established by SEC rules (i.e., not later than August
31 of each year for the most recent 12-month period ended June 30).

I.  BOARD-APPROVED PROPOSALS
- ----------------------------

The vast majority of matters presented to shareholders for a vote
involve proposals made by a company itself (sometimes referred to as
"management proposals"), which have been approved and recommended by
its board of directors.  In view of the enhanced corporate
governance practices currently being implemented in public companies
and of the funds' intent to hold corporate boards accountable for
their actions in promoting shareholder interests, the funds' proxies
generally will be voted for the decisions reached by majority
independent boards of directors, except as otherwise indicated in
these guidelines.  Accordingly, the funds' proxies will be voted for
board-approved proposals, except as follows:

Matters relating to the Board of Directors
- ------------------------------------------

Uncontested Election of Directors

The funds' proxies will be voted for the election of a company's
nominees for the board of directors, except as follows:

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have a majority of independent directors,

* the board has not established independent nominating, audit, and
compensation committees,

* the board has more than 19 members or fewer than five members,
absent special circumstances,

* the board has not acted to implement a policy requested in a
shareholder proposal that received the support of a majority of the
shares of the company at its previous two annual meetings, or

* the board has adopted or renewed a shareholder rights plan
(commonly referred to as a "poison pill") without shareholder
approval during the current or prior calendar year.

The funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who:

* is considered an independent director by the company and who has
received compensation from the company other than for service as a
director (e.g., investment banking, consulting, legal, or financial
advisory fees),

* attends less than 75% of board and committee meetings without
valid reasons for the absences (e.g., illness, personal emergency,
etc.),

* as a director of a public company (Company A), is employed as a
senior executive of another public company (Company B) if a director
of Company B serves as a senior executive of Company A (commonly
referred to as an "interlocking directorate"), or

* serves on more than five unaffiliated public company boards (for
the purpose of this guideline, boards of affiliated registered
investment companies will count as one board).

Commentary:

Board independence:  Unless otherwise indicated, for the purposes of
determining whether a board has a majority of independent directors
and independent nominating, audit, and compensation committees, an
"independent director" is a director who (1) meets all requirements
to serve as an independent director of a company under the final
NYSE Corporate Governance Rules (e.g., no material business
relationships with the company and no present or recent employment
relationship with the company (including employment of an immediate
family member as an executive officer)), and (2) has not accepted
directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other
compensatory fee from the company other than in his or her capacity
as a member of the board of directors or any board committee.  The
funds' Trustees believe that the receipt of compensation for
services other than service as a director raises significant
independence issues.

Board size:  The funds' Trustees believe that the size of the board
of directors can have a direct impact on the ability of the board to
govern effectively.  Boards that have too many members can be
unwieldy and ultimately inhibit their ability to oversee management
performance.  Boards that have too few members can stifle innovation
and lead to excessive influence by management.

Time commitment:  Being a director of a company requires a
significant time commitment to adequately prepare for and attend the
company's board and committee meetings.  Directors must be able to
commit the time and attention necessary to perform their fiduciary
duties in proper fashion, particularly in times of crisis.  The
funds' Trustees are concerned about over-committed directors.  In
some cases, directors may serve on too many boards to make a
meaningful contribution.  This may be particularly true for senior
executives of public companies (or other directors with
substantially full-time employment) who serve on more than a few
outside boards.  The funds may withhold votes from such directors on
a case-by-case basis where it appears that they may be unable to
discharge their duties properly because of excessive commitments.

Interlocking directorships:  The funds' Trustees believe that
interlocking directorships are inconsistent with the degree of
independence required for outside directors of public companies.

Corporate governance practices:  Board independence depends not only
on its members' individual relationships, but also on the board's
overall attitude toward management.  Independent boards are
committed to good corporate governance practices and, by providing
objective independent judgment, enhancing shareholder value.  The
funds may withhold votes on a case-by-case basis from some or all
directors who, through their lack of independence, have failed to
observe good corporate governance practices or, through specific
corporate action, have demonstrated a disregard for the interest of
shareholders.

Contested Elections of Directors

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis in contested elections
of directors.

Classified Boards

The funds will vote against proposals to classify a board, absent
special circumstances indicating that shareholder interests would be
better served by this structure.

Commentary:  Under a typical classified board structure, the
directors are divided into three classes, with each class serving a
three-year term.  The classified board structure results in
directors serving staggered terms, with usually only a third of the
directors up for re-election at any given annual meeting.  The
funds' Trustees generally believe that it is appropriate for
directors to stand for election each year, but recognize that, in
special circumstances, shareholder interests may be better served
under a classified board structure.

Other Board-Related Proposals

The funds will generally vote for board-approved proposals that have
been approved by a majority independent board, and on a case-by-case
basis on board-approved proposals where the board fails to meet the
guidelines' basic independence standards (i.e., majority of
independent directors and independent nominating, audit, and
compensation committees).

Executive Compensation
- ----------------------

The funds generally favor compensation programs that relate
executive compensation to a company's long-term performance.  The
funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals
relating to executive compensation, except as follows:

Except where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors, the funds will vote for stock option and
restricted stock plans that will result in an average annual
dilution of 1.67% or less (based on the disclosed term of the plan
and including all equity-based plans).

The funds will vote against stock option and restricted stock
plans that will result in an average annual dilution of greater than
1.67% (based on the disclosed term of the plan and including all
equity-based plans).

The funds will vote against any stock option or restricted stock
plan where the company's actual grants of stock options and
restricted stock under all equity-based compensation plans during
the prior three (3) fiscal years have resulted in an average annual
dilution of greater than 1.67%.

The funds will vote against stock option plans that permit the
replacing or repricing of underwater options (and against any
proposal to authorize such replacement or repricing of underwater
options).

The funds will vote against stock option plans that permit
issuance of options with an exercise price below the stock's current
market price.

Except where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors, the funds will vote for an employee stock
purchase plan that has the following features:  (1) the shares
purchased under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their
market value; (2) the offering period under the plan is 27 months or
less; and (3) dilution is 10% or less.

Commentary:  Companies should have compensation programs that are
reasonable and that align shareholder and management interests over
the longer term.  Further, disclosure of compensation programs
should provide absolute transparency to shareholders regarding the
sources and amounts of, and the factors influencing, executive
compensation.  Appropriately designed equity-based compensation
plans can be an effective way to align the interests of long-term
shareholders with the interests of management.  The funds may vote
against executive compensation proposals on a case-by-case basis
where compensation is excessive by reasonable corporate standards,
or where a company fails to provide transparent disclosure of
executive compensation.  In voting on a proposal relating to
executive compensation, the funds will consider whether the proposal
has been approved by an independent compensation committee of the
board.

Capitalization
- --------------

Many proxy proposals involve changes in a company's capitalization,
including the authorization of additional stock, the issuance of
stock, the repurchase of outstanding stock, or the approval of a
stock split.  The management of a company's capital structure
involves a number of important issues, including cash flow,
financing needs, and market conditions that are unique to the
circumstances of the company.  As a result, the funds will vote on a
case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals involving changes to
a company's capitalization, except that where the funds are not
otherwise withholding votes from the entire board of directors:

The funds will vote for proposals relating to the authorization
and issuance of additional common stock (except where such proposals
relate to a specific transaction).

The funds will vote for proposals to effect stock splits
(excluding reverse stock splits).

The funds will vote for proposals authorizing share repurchase
programs.

Commentary:  A company may decide to authorize additional shares of
common stock for reasons relating to executive compensation or for
routine business purposes.  For the most part, these decisions are
best left to the board of directors and senior management.  The
funds will vote on a case-by-case basis, however, on other proposals
to change a company's capitalization, including the authorization of
common stock with special voting rights, the authorization or
issuance of common stock in connection with a specific transaction
(e.g., an acquisition, merger or reorganization), or the
authorization or issuance of preferred stock.  Actions such as these
involve a number of considerations that may affect a shareholder's
investment and that warrant a case-by-case determination.

Acquisitions, Mergers, Reincorporations, Reorganizations and Other
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Transactions
- ------------

Shareholders may be confronted with a number of different types of
transactions, including acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations
involving business combinations, liquidations, and the sale of all
or substantially all of a company's assets, which may require their
consent.  Voting on such proposals involves considerations unique to
each transaction.  As a result, the funds will vote on a
case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals to effect these types
of transactions, except as follows:

The funds will vote for mergers and reorganizations involving
business combinations designed solely to reincorporate a company in
Delaware.

Commentary:  A company may reincorporate into another state through
a merger or reorganization by setting up a "shell" company in a
different state and then merging the company into the new company.
While reincorporation into states with extensive and established
corporate laws - notably Delaware - provides companies and
shareholders with a more well-defined legal framework, shareholders
must carefully consider the reasons for a reincorporation into
another jurisdiction, including especially an offshore jurisdiction.

Anti-Takeover Measures
- ----------------------

Some proxy proposals involve efforts by management to make it more
difficult for an outside party to take control of the company
without the approval of the company's board of directors.  These
include the adoption of a shareholder rights plan, requiring
supermajority voting on particular issues, the adoption of fair
price provisions, the issuance of blank check preferred stock, and
the creation of a separate class of stock with disparate voting
rights.  Such proposals may adversely affect shareholder rights,
lead to management entrenchment, or create conflicts of interest.
As a result, the funds will vote against board-approved proposals to
adopt such anti-takeover measures, except as follows:

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify
or approve shareholder rights plans; and

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to adopt
fair price provisions.

Commentary:  The funds' Trustees recognize that poison pills and
fair price provisions may enhance shareholder value under certain
circumstances.  As a result, the funds will consider proposals to
approve such matters on a case-by-case basis.

Other Business Matters
- ----------------------

Many proxies involve approval of routine business matters, such as
changing a company's name, ratifying the appointment of auditors,
and procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting.  For the
most part, these routine matters do not materially affect
shareholder interests and are best left to the board of directors
and senior management of the company.  The funds will vote for
board-approved proposals approving such matters, except as follows:

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend
a company's charter or bylaws (except for charter amendments
necessary or to effect stock splits to change a company's name or to
authorize additional shares of common stock).

The funds will vote against authorization to transact other
unidentified, substantive business at the meeting.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other business
matters where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors.

Commentary:  Charter and bylaw amendments and the transaction of
other unidentified, substantive business at a shareholder meeting
may directly affect shareholder rights and have a significant impact
on shareholder value.  As a result, the funds do not view such items
as routine business matters.  Putnam Management's investment
professionals and the funds' proxy voting service may also bring to
the Proxy Coordinator's attention company-specific items that they
believe to be non-routine and warranting special consideration.
Under these circumstances, the funds will vote on a case-by-case
basis.

II.  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
- --------------------------

SEC regulations permit shareholders to submit proposals for
inclusion in a company's proxy statement.  These proposals generally
seek to change some aspect of the company's corporate governance
structure or to change some aspect of its business operations.  The
funds generally will vote in accordance with the recommendation of
the company's board of directors on all shareholder proposals,
except as follows:

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals to declassify a
board, absent special circumstances which would indicate that
shareholder interests are better served by a classified board
structure.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals to require
shareholder approval of shareholder rights plans.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals that are consistent
with the funds' proxy voting guidelines for board-approved
proposals.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other shareholder
proposals where the funds are otherwise withholding votes for the
entire board of directors.

Commentary:  In light of the substantial reforms in corporate
governance that are currently underway, the funds' Trustees believe
that effective corporate reforms should be promoted by holding
boards of directors - and in particular their independent directors
- - accountable for their actions, rather than imposing additional
legal restrictions on board governance through piecemeal proposals.
Generally speaking, shareholder proposals relating to business
operations are often motivated primarily by political or social
concerns, rather than the interests of shareholders as investors in
an economic enterprise.  As stated above, the funds' Trustees
believe that boards of directors and management are responsible for
ensuring that their businesses are operating in accordance with high
legal and ethical standards and should be held accountable for
resulting corporate behavior.  Accordingly, the funds will generally
support the recommendations of boards that meet the basic
independence and governance standards established in these
guidelines.  Where boards fail to meet these standards, the funds
will generally evaluate shareholder proposals on a case-by-case
basis.

III.  VOTING SHARES OF NON-U.S. ISSUERS
- ---------------------------------------

Many of the Putnam funds invest on a global basis, and, as a result,
they may be required to vote shares held in non-U.S. issuers - i.e.,
issuers that are incorporated under the laws of foreign
jurisdictions and that are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange
or the NASDAQ stock market.  Because non-U.S. issuers are
incorporated under the laws of countries and jurisdictions outside
the U.S., protection for shareholders may vary significantly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Laws governing non-U.S. issuers may,
in some cases, provide substantially less protection for
shareholders.  As a result, the foregoing guidelines, which are
premised on the existence of a sound corporate governance and
disclosure framework, may not be appropriate under some
circumstances for non-U.S. issuers.

In many non-U.S. markets, shareholders who vote proxies of a
non-U.S. issuer are not able to trade in that company's stock on or
around the shareholder meeting date.  This practice is known as
"share blocking."  In countries where share blocking is practiced,
the funds will vote proxies only with direction from Putnam
Management's investment professionals.

In addition, some non-U.S. markets require that a company's shares
be re-registered out of the name of the local custodian or nominee
into the name of the shareholder for the meeting.  This practice is
known as "share re-registration."  As a result, shareholders,
including the funds, are not able to trade in that company's stock
until the shares are re-registered back in the name of the local
custodian or nominee.  In countries where share re-registration is
practiced, the funds will generally not vote proxies.

The funds will vote proxies of non-U.S. issuers in accordance with
the foregoing guidelines where applicable, except as follows:

Uncontested Election of Directors
- ---------------------------------

Japan

For companies that have established a U.S.-style corporate
structure, the funds will withhold votes for the entire board of
directors if

* the board does not have a majority of outside directors,

* the board has not established nominating and compensation
committees composed of a majority of outside directors, or

* the board has not established an audit committee composed of a
majority of independent directors.

The funds will withhold votes for the appointment of members of a
company's board of statutory auditors if a majority of the members
of the board of statutory auditors is not independent.

Commentary:

Board structure:  Recent amendments to the Japanese Commercial Code
give companies the option to adopt a U.S.-style corporate structure
(i.e., a board of directors and audit, nominating, and compensation
committees).  The funds will vote for proposals to amend a company's
articles of incorporation to adopt the U.S.-style corporate
structure.

Definition of outside director and independent director:  Corporate
governance principles in Japan focus on the distinction between
outside directors and independent directors.  Under these
principles, an outside director is a director who is not and has
never been a director, executive, or employee of the company or its
parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates.  An outside director is
"independent" if that person can make decisions completely
independent from the managers of the company, its parent,
subsidiaries, or affiliates and does not have a material
relationship with the company (i.e., major client, trading partner,
or other business relationship; familial relationship with current
director or executive; etc.).  The guidelines have incorporated
these definitions in applying the board independence standards
above.

Korea

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have a majority of outside directors,

* the board has not established a nominating committee composed of
at least a majority of outside directors, or

* the board has not established an audit committee composed of at
least three members and in which at least two-thirds of its members
are outside directors.

Commentary:   For purposes of these guideline, an "outside director"
is a director that is independent from the management or controlling
shareholders of the company, and holds no interests that might
impair performing his or her duties impartially from the company,
management or controlling shareholder.  In determining whether a
director is an outside director, the funds will also apply the
standards included in Article 415-2(2) of the Korean Commercial Code
(i.e., no employment relationship with the company for a period of
two years before serving on the committee, no director or employment
relationship with the company's largest shareholder, etc.) and may
consider other business relationships that would affect the
independence of an outside director.

United Kingdom

The funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* the board does not have at least a majority of independent
non-executive directors,

* the board has not established nomination committees composed of a
majority of independent non-executive directors, or

* the board has not established compensation and audit committees
composed of (1) at least three directors (in the case of smaller
companies, two directors) and (2) solely of independent
non-executive directors.

The funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who is
considered an independent director by the company and who has
received compensation from the company other than for service as a
director (e.g., investment banking, consulting, legal, or financial
advisory fees).

Commentary:

Application of guidelines:  Although the U.K.'s Combined Code on
Corporate Governance ("Combined Code") has adopted the "comply and
explain" approach to corporate governance, the funds' Trustees
believe that the guidelines discussed above with respect to board
independence standards are integral to the protection of investors
in U.K. companies.  As a result, these guidelines will be applied in
a prescriptive manner.

Definition of independence:  For the purposes of these guidelines, a
non-executive director shall be considered independent if the
director meets the independence standards in section A.3.1 of the
Combined Code (i.e., no material business or employment
relationships with the company, no remuneration from the company for
non-board services, no close family ties with senior employees or
directors of the company, etc.), except that the funds do not view
service on the board for more than nine years as affecting a
director's independence.

Smaller companies:  A smaller company is one that is below the FTSE
350 throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting year.

Canada

In January 2004, Canadian securities regulators issued proposed
policies that would impose new corporate governance requirements on
Canadian public companies.  The recommended practices contained in
these new corporate governance requirements mirror corporate
governance reforms that have been adopted by the NYSE and other U.S.
national securities exchanges and stock markets.  As a result, the
funds will vote on matters relating to the board of directors of
Canadian issuers in accordance with the guidelines applicable to
U.S. issuers.

Commentary:  Like the U.K.'s Combined Code, the proposed policies on
corporate governance issued by Canadian securities regulators embody
the "comply and explain" approach to corporate governance.  Because
the funds' Trustees believe that the board independence standards
contained in the proxy voting guidelines are integral to the
protection of investors in Canadian companies, these standards will
be applied in a prescriptive manner.

Other Matters
- -------------

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals calling for a
majority of a company's directors to be independent of management.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals seeking to increase
the independence of board nominating, audit, and compensation
committees.

The funds will vote for shareholder proposals that implement
corporate governance standards similar to those established under
U.S. federal law and the listing requirements of U.S. stock
exchanges, and that do not otherwise violate the laws of the
jurisdiction under which the company is incorporated.

The funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals relating
to (1) the issuance of common stock in excess of 20% of the
company's outstanding common stock where shareholders do not have
preemptive rights, or (2) the issuance of common stock in excess of
100% of the company's outstanding common stock where shareholders
have preemptive rights.

As adopted December 10, 2004




Proxy Voting Procedures of the Putnam Funds
- -------------------------------------------

The proxy voting procedures below explain the role of the funds' Trustees,
the proxy voting service and the Proxy Coordinator, as well as how the
process will work when a proxy question needs to be handled on a
case-by-case basis, or when there may be a conflict of interest.

The role of the funds' Trustees
- -------------------------------------------

The Trustees of the Putnam funds exercise control of the voting of proxies
through their Board Policy and Nominating Committee, which is composed
entirely of independent Trustees.  The Board Policy and Nominating Committee
oversees the proxy voting process and participates, as needed, in the
resolution of issues that need to be handled on a case-by-case basis.  The
Committee annually reviews and recommends, for Trustee approval, guidelines
governing the funds' proxy votes, including how the funds vote on specific
proposals and which matters are to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The Trustees are assisted in this process by their independent
administrative staff ("Office of the Trustees"), independent legal counsel,
and an independent proxy voting service.  The Trustees also receive
assistance from Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the
funds' investment advisor, on matters involving investment judgments.  In
all cases, the ultimate decision on voting proxies rests with the Trustees,
acting as fiduciaries on behalf of the shareholders of the funds.

The role of the proxy voting service
- -------------------------------------------

The funds have engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
voting of proxies.  The proxy voting service is responsible for coordinating
with the funds' custodians to ensure that all proxy materials received by
the custodians relating to the funds' portfolio securities are processed in
a timely fashion.  To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service votes
all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting guidelines established by
the Trustees.  The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis.  The
proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
appear to involve unusual or controversial issues.  The funds also utilize
research services relating to proxy questions provided by the proxy voting
service and by other firms.

The role of the Proxy Coordinator
- -------------------------------------------

Each year, a member of the Office of the Trustees is appointed Proxy
Coordinator to assist in the coordination and voting of the funds' proxies.
The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy voting service and,
in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy voting service, will
solicit voting recommendations and instructions from the Office of the
Trustees, the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee, and Putnam
Management's investment professionals, as appropriate.  The Proxy
Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that these questions and referrals
are responded to in a timely fashion and for transmitting appropriate voting
instructions to the proxy voting service.

Voting procedures for referral items
- -------------------------------------------

As discussed above, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
the Proxy Coordinator under certain circumstances.  When the application of
the proxy voting guidelines is unclear or a particular proxy question is not
covered by the guidelines (and does not involve investment considerations),
the Proxy Coordinator will assist in interpreting the guidelines and, as
appropriate, consult with one of more senior staff members of the Office of
the Trustees and the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee on
how the funds' shares will be voted.

For proxy questions that require a case-by-case analysis pursuant to the
guidelines or that are not covered by the guidelines but involve investment
considerations, the Proxy Coordinator will refer such questions, through a
written request, to Putnam Management's investment professionals for a
voting recommendation.  Such referrals will be made in cooperation with the
person or persons designated by Putnam Management's Legal and Compliance
Department to assist in processing such referral items.  In connection with
each such referral item, the Legal and Compliance Department will conduct a
conflicts of interest review, as described below under "Conflicts of
Interest," and provide a conflicts of interest report (the "Conflicts
Report") to the Proxy Coordinator describing the results of such review.
After receiving a referral item from the Proxy Coordinator, Putnam
Management's investment professionals will provide a written recommendation
to the Proxy Coordinator and the person or persons designated by the Legal
and Compliance Department to assist in processing referral items.  Such
recommendation will set forth (1) how the proxies should be voted; (2) the
basis and rationale for such recommendation; and (3) any contacts the
investment professionals have had with respect to the referral item with
non-investment personnel of Putnam Management or with outside parties
(except for routine communications from proxy solicitors).  The Proxy
Coordinator will then review the investment professionals' recommendation
and the Conflicts Report with one of more senior staff members of the Office
of the Trustees in determining how to vote the funds' proxies.  The Proxy
Coordinator will maintain a record of all proxy questions that have been
referred to Putnam Management's investment professionals, the voting
recommendation, and the Conflicts Report.

In some situations, the Proxy Coordinator and/or one of more senior staff
members of the Office of the Trustees may determine that a particular proxy
question raises policy issues requiring consultation with the Chair of the
Board Policy and Nominating Committee, who, in turn, may decide to bring the
particular proxy question to the Committee or the full Board of Trustees for
consideration.

Conflicts of interest
- -------------------------------------------

Occasions may arise where a person or organization involved in the proxy
voting process may have a conflict of interest.  A conflict of interest may
exist, for example, if Putnam Management has a business relationship with
(or is actively soliciting business from) either the company soliciting the
proxy or a third party that has a material interest in the outcome of a
proxy vote or that is actively lobbying for a particular outcome of a proxy
vote.  Any individual with knowledge of a personal conflict of interest
(e.g., familial relationship with company management) relating to a
particular referral item shall disclose that conflict to the Proxy
Coordinator and the Legal and Compliance Department and otherwise remove
himself or herself from the proxy voting process.  The Legal and Compliance
Department will review each item referred to Putnam Management's investment
professionals to determine if a conflict of interest exists and will provide
the Proxy Coordinator with a Conflicts Report for each referral item that
(1) describes any conflict of interest; (2) discusses the procedures used to
address such conflict of interest; and (3) discloses any contacts from
parties outside Putnam Management (other than routine communications from
proxy solicitors) with respect to the referral item not otherwise reported
in an investment professional's recommendation.  The Conflicts Report will
also include written confirmation that any recommendation from an investment
professional provided under circumstances where a conflict of interest
exists was made solely on the investment merits and without regard to any
other consideration.

OVERVIEW

Every Putnam employee is required, as a condition of continued
employment, to read, understand, and comply with the entire Code of
Ethics. Additionally, employees are expected to comply with the policies
and procedures contained within the Putnam Employee Handbook, which can
be accessed online through www.ibenefitcenter.com. This overview is
provided only as a convenience and is not intended to substitute for a
careful reading of the complete document.

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that could create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our fund shareholders or other clients, or do anything
that could damage or erode the trust our clients place in Putnam and its
employees. This is the spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting
employment at Putnam, every employee accepts the absolute obligation to
comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code of Ethics. Failure to
comply with the spirit of the Code of Ethics is just as much a violation
of the Code as failure to comply with the written rules of the Code.

The rules of the Code cover activities, including personal securities
transactions, of Putnam employees, certain family members of employees,
and entities (such as corporations, trusts, or partnerships) that
employees may be deemed to control or influence.

Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code of Ethics.
Sanctions may include bans on personal trading, reductions in salary
increases or bonuses, disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of
employment, and termination of employment.

Insider trading

Putnam employees are forbidden to buy or sell any security while either
Putnam or the employee is in possession of material, non-public
information (inside information) concerning the security or the issuer.
A violation of Putnam's insider trading policies may result in criminal
and civil penalties, including imprisonment and substantial fines. An
employee aware of or in possession of inside information must report it
immediately to the Code of Ethics Officer. See Appendix A, Section ll:
Overview of Insider Trading.

Conflicts of interest

The Code of Ethics imposes limits on activities of Putnam employees
where the activity may conflict with the interests of Putnam or its
clients. These include limits on the receipt and solicitation of gifts
and on service as a fiduciary for a person or entity outside of Putnam.

For example, Putnam employees generally may not accept gifts over $100
in total value in a calendar year from any entity or any supplier of
goods or services to Putnam. In addition, a Putnam employee may not
serve as a director of any corporation or other entity without prior
approval of the Code of Ethics Officer, and Putnam employees may not be
members of investment clubs.

Confidentiality

Information about Putnam clients and Putnam investment activity and
research is proprietary and confidential and may not be disclosed or
used by any Putnam employee outside Putnam without a valid business
purpose.

Personal securities trading

Putnam employees may not buy or sell any security for their own account
without clearing the proposed transaction in advance. Clearance is
facilitated through the online pre-clearance system for equity
securities, and directly with the Code of Ethics Administrator for
fixed-income securities and transactions in Putnam closed-end funds.
Certain securities are exempted from this pre-clearance requirement
(e.g., shares of open-end (not closed-end) mutual funds).

Clearance must be obtained in advance, between 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the day of the trade, except in the case
of a trade for up to 1,000 shares of stock of an issuer whose
capitalization exceeds $5 billion, clearance may be obtained between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST on the day of the trade.  A clearance is
valid only for the day it is obtained. Putnam employees are strongly
discouraged from engaging in excessive trading for their personal
accounts. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2004, employees will be
prohibited from making more than 25 trades in individual securities.
Trading in excess of this level will be reviewed with the Code of Ethics
Oversight Committee.

Putnam mutual funds

All employees and certain family members are subject to a minimum 90-day
holding period for shares in Putnam's open-end mutual funds. This
restriction does not apply to Putnam's money market funds. Except in
limited circumstances, all employees must hold Putnam open-end fund
shares in accounts at Putnam Preferred Access.

Portfolio managers and others with access to investment information
(so-called "Access Persons") are subject to a minimum one-year holding
period for holding Putnam open-end fund shares.

Short selling

Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security, whether
or not it is held in a Putnam client portfolio, except that short
selling against broad market indexes and "against the box" are
permitted. Note, however, that short selling "against the box" or
otherwise hedging an investment in shares of Marsh & McLennan (MMC)
stock is prohibited.

Confirmations of trading and periodic account statements

All Putnam employees must have their brokers send confirmations and
statements of personal securities transactions, including transactions
of immediate family members and accounts over which the employee has
investment discretion, to the Code of Ethics Officer. Employees must
contact the Code of Ethics Administrator to obtain an authorization
letter from Putnam for setting up a personal brokerage account.

Quarterly and annual reporting

Access persons must report all their securities transactions in each
calendar quarter to the Code of Ethics Officer within 10 days after the
end of the quarter. All Access Persons must disclose all personal
securities holdings (even those to which pre-clearance may not apply)
upon commencement of employment and thereafter on an annual basis. You
will be notified if these requirements apply to you. If these
requirements apply to you and you fail to report as required, salary
increases and bonuses may be reduced. Egregious conduct, e.g., willful
failures to report, will be subject to harsher sanctions, which may
include termination of employment.

IPOs and private placements

Putnam employees may not buy any securities in an initial public
offering or in a private placement, except in limited circumstances when
prior written authorization is obtained.

Personal securities transactions by Access Persons
and certain investment professionals

The Code imposes several special restrictions on personal securities
transactions by Access Persons and certain investment professionals,
which are summarized as follows. (Refer to Section II for details):

* 60-Day Holding Period. No Access Person shall purchase and then sell
at a profit, or sell and then repurchase at a lower price, any security
or related derivative security within 60 calendar days.

* 7-Day Rule. Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a
security for any portfolio he manages, he must sell from his personal
account any such security or related derivative security purchased
within the preceding seven calendar days and disgorge any profit from
the sale.

* Blackout Rules. No portfolio manager may sell any security or related
derivative security for her personal account until seven calendar days
have passed since the most recent purchase of that security or related
derivative security by any portfolio she manages. No portfolio manager
may buy any security or related derivative security for his personal
account until seven calendar days have passed since the most recent sale
of that security or related derivative security by any portfolio he
manages.

* Contra-Trading Rule. No portfolio manager may sell out of her personal
account any security or related derivative security that is held in any
portfolio she manages unless she has received the written approval of an
appropriate CIO and the Code of Ethics Officer.

* No portfolio manager may cause a Putnam client to take action for the
manager's own personal benefit.

Similar rules limit personal securities transactions by analysts,
co-managers, and chief investment officers. Please read these rules
carefully as you are responsible for understanding the restrictions.


PREAMBLE

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that would create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our fund shareholders or other clients, or do anything
that could damage or erode the trust our clients place in Putnam and its
employees. This is the spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting
employment at Putnam, every employee also accepts the absolute
obligation to comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code of
Ethics. Failure to comply with the spirit of the Code of Ethics is just
as much a violation of the Code as failure to comply with the written
rules of the Code. Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code
of Ethics, including the Code's reporting requirements.

Sanctions may include bans on personal trading, reductions in salary
increases or bonuses, disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of
employment, and termination of employment.

Putnam Investments is required by law to adopt a Code of Ethics. The
purposes of the law are to ensure that companies and their employees
comply with all applicable laws and to prevent abuses in the investment
advisory business that can arise when conflicts of interest exist
between the employees of an investment advisor and its clients. By
adopting and enforcing a Code of Ethics, we strengthen the trust and
confidence reposed in us by demonstrating that, at Putnam, client
interests come before personal interests.

The Code that follows represents a balancing of important interests. On
the one hand, as a registered investment advisor, Putnam owes a duty of
undivided loyalty to its clients, and must avoid even the appearance of
a conflict that might be perceived as abusing the trust they have placed
in Putnam. On the other hand, Putnam does not want to prevent
conscientious professionals from investing for their own account where
conflicts do not exist or are so attenuated as to be immaterial to
investment decisions affecting Putnam clients.

When conflicting interests cannot be reconciled, the Code makes clear
that, first and foremost, Putnam employees owe a fiduciary duty to
Putnam clients. In most cases, this means that the affected employee
will be required to forego conflicting personal securities transactions.
In some cases, personal investments will be permitted, but only in a
manner, which, because of the circumstances and applicable controls,
cannot reasonably be perceived as adversely affecting Putnam client
portfolios or taking unfair advantage of the relationship Putnam
employees have to Putnam clients.

The Code contains specific rules prohibiting defined types of conflicts.
Because every potential conflict cannot be anticipated in advance, the
Code also contains certain general provisions prohibiting conflict
situations. In view of these general provisions, it is critical that any
individual who is in doubt about the applicability of the Code in a
given situation seek a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer
about the propriety of the conduct in advance. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination are described in Section VII of the Code.

It is critical that the Code be strictly observed. Not only will
adherence to the Code ensure that Putnam renders the best possible
service to its clients, it will ensure that no individual is liable for
violations of law.

It should be emphasized that adherence to this policy is a fundamental
condition of employment at Putnam. Every employee is expected to adhere
to the requirements of this Code of Ethics despite any inconvenience
that may be involved. Any employee failing to do so may be subject to
such disciplinary action, including financial penalties and termination
of employment, as determined by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee
or the Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.

SECTION I

Personal Securities Rules for All Employees

A. Pre-clearance and the Restricted List

Rule 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell for his personal account any
security (other than shares of open-end investment companies) without
prior clearance obtained through Putnam's intranet pre-clearance system
(under the @Putnam tab of www.ibenefitcenter.com). Fixed-income
securities must be pre-cleared by calling the Code of Ethics
Administrator, and there are special rules for trading in Putnam
closed-end funds. See Appendix B. Subject to the limited exceptions
below, no clearance will be granted for securities appearing on the

Restricted List. Securities will be placed on the Restricted List in the
following circumstances:

(a) When orders to purchase or sell such security have been entered for
any Putnam client, or the security is being actively considered for
purchase for any Putnam client, unless the security is a nonconvertible
investment grade rated (BBB by S&P or Baa by Moody's) fixed-income
investment;

(b) When such a security is a voting security of a corporation in the
banking, savings and loan, communications, or gaming (i.e., casinos)
industries, if holdings of Putnam clients in that corporation exceed 7%
(for public utilities, the threshold is 4%);

(c) When, in the judgment of the Code of Ethics Officer, other
circumstances warrant restricting personal transactions of Putnam
employees in a particular security;

(d) The circumstances described in the Policy Statement Concerning
Insider Trading Prohibitions, attached as Appendix A.

Reminder: Securities for an employee's personal account include
securities owned by certain family members of a Putnam employee. Thus,
this Rule prohibits certain trades by family members of Putnam
employees. See Definitions.

Compliance with this rule does not exempt an employee from complying
with any other applicable rules of the Code, such as those described in
Section III. In particular, Access Persons and certain investment
professionals must comply with the special rules set forth in Section
II.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. Maintenance of Restricted List. The Restricted List shall be
maintained by the Code of Ethics Administrator.

B. Consulting Restricted List. An employee wishing to trade any security
for his personal account shall first obtain clearance through Putnam's
Intranet pre-clearance system. The system may be accessed online at
ibenefitcenter.com. Select Employee Essentials under the @Putnam tab.
Employees may pre-clear all securities between 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
EST, and may pre-clear purchases or sales of up to 1,000 shares of
issuers having a market capitalization of more than $5 billion between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST.

Requests to make personal securities transactions may not be made using
the system or presented to the Code of Ethics Administrator after
4:00 p.m. EST.

Pre-clearance of fixed income securities and Putnam closed-end funds
must be made by calling the Code of Ethics Administrator.

The pre-clearance system will inform the employee whether the security
may be traded and whether trading in the security is subject to the
"Large Cap" limitation. The response of the pre-clearance system as to
whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so, whether it
is eligible for the exceptions set forth after this Rule shall be final,
unless the employee appeals to the Code of Ethics Officer, using the
procedure described in Section VII, regarding the request to trade a
particular security.

A clearance is only valid for trading on the day it is obtained. Trades
in securities listed on Asian or European stock exchanges, however, may
be executed within one business day after pre-clearance is obtained.

If a security is not on the Restricted List, other classes of securities
of the same issuer (e.g., preferred or convertible preferred stock) may
be on the Restricted List. It is the employee's responsibility to
identify with particularity the class of securities for which permission
is being sought for a personal investment.

If the pre-clearance system does not recognize a security, or if an
employee is unable to use the system or has any questions with respect
to the system or pre-clearance, the employee may consult the Code of
Ethics Administrator. The Code of Ethics Administrator shall not have
authority to answer any questions about a security other than whether
trading is permitted. The response of the Code of Ethics Administrator
as to whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so,
whether it is eligible for any applicable exceptions set forth after
this Rule shall be final, unless the employee appeals to the Code of
Ethics Officer, using the procedure described in Section VII, regarding
the request to trade a particular security.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Large Cap Exception. If a security appearing on the Restricted List
is an equity security for which the issuer has a market capitalization
(defined as outstanding shares multiplied by current price per share) of
over $5 billion, then a Putnam employee may purchase or sell up to 1,000
shares of the security per day for his personal account. This exception
does not apply if the security appears on the Restricted List in the
circumstances described in subpart (b), (c), or (d) of Rule 1.

B. Pre-clearing Transactions Effected by Share Subscription. The
purchase of securities made by subscription rather than on an exchange
are limited to issuers having a market capitalization of $5 billion or
more and are subject to a 1,000 share limit. The following are
procedures to comply with Rule 1 when effecting a purchase or sale of
shares by subscription:

(a) The Putnam employee must pre-clear the trade on the day he or she
submits a subscription to the issuer, rather than on the actual day of
the trade since the actual day of the trade typically will not be known
to the employee who submits the subscription. At the time of
pre-clearance, the employee will be told whether the purchase is
permitted (in the case of a corporation having a market capitalization
of $5 billion or more), or not permitted (in the case of a smaller
capitalization issuer).

(b) The subscription for any purchase or sale of shares must be reported
on the employee's quarterly personal securities transaction report,
noting the trade was accomplished by subscription.

(c) Because no brokers are involved in the transaction, the confirmation
requirement will be waived for these transactions, although the Putnam
employee must provide the Legal and Compliance Department with any
transaction summaries or statements sent by the issuer.

C. Trades in Approved Discretionary Brokerage Accounts. A transaction
does not need to be pre-cleared if it takes place in an account that the
Code of Ethics Officer has approved in writing as exempt from the
pre-clearance requirement. In the sole discretion of the Code of Ethics
Officer accounts that will be considered for exclusion from the
pre-clearance requirement are only those for which an employee's
securities broker or investment advisor has complete discretion (a
discretionary account) and the following conditions are met (i) the
employee certifies annually in writing that the employee has no
influence over the transactions in the discretionary account and is not
aware of the transactions in the discretionary account prior to their
execution, (ii) the compliance department of the employee's broker or
investment advisor certifies annually in writing that the employee has
no influence over the transactions in the discretionary account and is
not aware of the transactions in the discretionary account prior to
their execution; and (iii) each calendar quarter, the broker or
investment advisor sends Putnam's Code of Ethics Administrator copies of
each quarterly statement for the discretionary account. Employees
wishing to seek such an exemption must send a written request to the
Code of Ethics Administrator.


COMMENTS

* Pre-clearance. Subpart (a) of Rule 1 is designed to avoid the conflict
of interest that might occur when an employee trades for his personal
account a security that currently is being traded or is likely to be
traded for a Putnam client. Such conflicts arise, for example, when the
trades of an employee might have an impact on the price or availability
of a particular security, or when the trades of the client might have an
impact on price to the benefit of the employee. Thus, exceptions involve
situations where the trade of a Putnam employee is unlikely to have an
impact on the market.

* Regulatory Limits. Owing to a variety of federal statutes and
regulations in the banking, savings and loan, communications, and gaming
industries, it is critical that accounts of Putnam clients not hold more
than 10% of the voting securities (5% for public utilities) of any
issuer in those industries. Because of the risk that the personal
holdings of Putnam employees may be aggregated with Putnam holdings for
these purposes, subpart (b) of this Rule limits personal trades in these
areas. The 7% limit (4% for public utilities) will allow the regulatory
limits to be observed.

* Options. For the purposes of this Code, options are treated like the
underlying security. See Definitions. Thus, an employee may not
purchase, sell, or "write" option contracts for a security that is on
the Restricted List. The automatic exercise of an options contract (the
purchase or writing of which was previously pre-cleared) does not have
to be pre-cleared. Note, however, that the sale of securities obtained
through the exercise of options must be pre-cleared.

* Involuntary transactions. Involuntary personal securities transactions
are exempted from the Code. Special attention should be paid to this
exemption. (See Section I.D.)

* Tender offers. This Rule does not prohibit an employee from tendering
securities from his personal account in response to an any and all
tender offer, even if Putnam clients are also tendering securities. A
Putnam employee is, however, prohibited from tendering securities from
his personal account in response to a partial tender offer, if Putnam
clients are also tendering securities.

* MMC securities. The pre-clearance, reporting and the rules applicable
to personal trading apply to securities of MMC, including MMC shares
held in the Putnam 401(k) plans and in the MMC Stock Purchase Plan.


SANCTION GUIDELINES

A. Failure to Pre-clear a Personal Trade

* First violation: One month trading ban with written warning that a
future violation will result in a longer trading ban.

* Second violation: Three month trading ban and written notice to the
Senior Managing Director of the employee's division.

* Third violation: Six month trading ban with possible longer or
permanent trading ban based upon review by Code of Ethics Oversight
Committee.

B. Failure to Pre-clear Securities on the Restricted List

* First violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, one
month trading ban, and written warning that a future violation will
result in a longer trading ban.

* Second violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction,
three month trading ban, and written notice to the Senior Managing
Director of the employee's division.

* Third violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, and
six month trading ban with possible longer or permanent trading ban
based upon review by Code of Ethics Oversight Committee.

NOTE

These are the sanction guidelines for successive failures to pre-clear
personal trades within a two-year period. The Code of Ethics Oversight
Committee retains the right to increase or decrease the sanction for a
particular violation in light of the circumstances. The Committee's
belief that an employee has violated the Code of Ethics intentionally
will result in more severe sanctions than outlined in the guidelines
above. The sanctions described in paragraph B apply to Restricted List
securities that are: (a) small-cap stocks (i.e., stocks not entitled to
the Large Cap exception) and (b) large-cap stocks that exceed the daily
1,000 share maximum permitted under the Large Cap exception. Failure to
pre-clear an otherwise permitted trade of up to 1,000 shares of a
large-cap security is subject to the sanctions described above in
paragraph A.

B. Prohibited Transactions

Rule 1

Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security, whether
or not the security is held in a Putnam client portfolio. Employees are
prohibited from hedging investments made in securities of MMC.


EXCEPTIONS

Short selling against broad market indexes (such as the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, the NASDAQ index, and the S&P 100 and 500 indexes)
and short selling against the box are permitted (except that short
selling shares of MMC against the box is not permitted).

Rule 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for her personal account
in an initial public offering.


EXCEPTION

Pre-existing Status Exception. A Putnam employee shall not be barred by
this Rule or by Rule 1(a) of Section I.A. from purchasing securities for
her personal account in connection with an initial public offering of
securities by a bank or insurance company when the employee's status as
a policyholder or depositor entitles her to purchase securities on terms
more favorable than those available to the general public, in connection
with the bank's conversion from mutual or cooperative form to stock
form, or the insurance company's conversion from mutual to stock form,
provided that the employee has had the status entitling her to purchase
on favorable terms for at least two years. This exception is only
available with respect to the value of bank deposits or insurance
policies that an employee owns before the announcement of the initial
public offering. This exception does not apply, however, if the security
appears on the Restricted List in the circumstances set forth in
subparts (b), (c), or (d) of Section I.A., Rule 1.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. General Implementation. An employee shall inquire, before any
purchase of a security for her personal account, whether the security to
be purchased is being offered pursuant to an initial public offering. If
the security is offered through an initial public offering, the employee
shall refrain from purchasing that security for her personal account
unless the exception applies.

B. Administration of Exception. If the employee believes the exception
applies, she shall consult the Code of Ethics Administrator concerning
whether the security appears on the Restricted List and if so, whether
it is eligible for this exception.


COMMENTS

* The purpose of this Rule is twofold. First, it is designed to prevent
a conflict of interest between Putnam employees and Putnam clients who
might be in competition for the same securities in a limited public
offering. Second, the Rule is designed to prevent Putnam employees from
being subject to undue influence as a result of receiving favors in the
form of special allocations of securities in a public offering from
broker-dealers who seek to do business with Putnam.

* Purchases of securities in the immediate after-market of an initial
public offering are not prohibited, provided they do not constitute
violations of other portions of the Code of Ethics. For example,
participation in the immediate after-market as a result of a special
allocation from an underwriting group would be prohibited by Section
III, Rule 3 concerning gifts and other favors.

* Public offerings subsequent to initial public offerings are not deemed
to create the same potential for competition between Putnam employees
and Putnam clients because of the pre-existence of a market for the
securities.

Rule 3

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for his personal account
in a limited private offering or private placement. Privately placed
limited partnerships are specifically included in this Rule.


COMMENTS

* The purpose of this Rule is to prevent a Putnam employee from
investing in securities for his own account pursuant to a limited
private offering that could compete with or disadvantage Putnam clients,
and to prevent Putnam employees from being subject to efforts to curry
favor by those who seek to do business with Putnam.

* Exemptions to the prohibition will generally not be granted where the
proposed investment relates directly or indirectly to investments by a
Putnam client, or where individuals involved in the offering (including
the issuers, broker, underwriter, placement agent, promoter, fellow
investors and affiliates of the foregoing) have any prior or existing
business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee, or where the
Putnam employee believes that such individuals may expect to have a
future business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee.

* An exemption may be granted, subject to reviewing all the facts and
circumstances, for investments in:

(a) Pooled investment funds, including hedge funds, subject to the
condition that an employee investing in a pooled investment fund would
have no involvement in the activities or decision-making process of the
fund except for financial reports made in the ordinary course of the
fund's business, and subject to the condition that the hedge fund does
not invest significantly in registered investment companies.

(b) Private placements where the investment cannot relate, or be
expected to relate, directly or indirectly to Putnam or investments by a
Putnam client.

* Employees who apply for an exemption will be expected to disclose to
the Code of Ethics Officer in writing all facts and relationships
relating to the proposed investment.

* Applications to invest in private placements will be reviewed by the
Code of Ethics Oversight Committee. This review will take into account,
among other factors, the considerations described in the preceding
comments.

Rule 4

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security for her personal
account or for any Putnam client account while in possession of
material, nonpublic information concerning the security or the issuer.


EXCEPTIONS

None. Please read Appendix A, Policy Statement Concerning Insider
Trading Prohibitions.

Rule 5

No Putnam employee shall purchase from or sell to a Putnam client any
securities or other property for his personal account, nor engage in any
personal transaction to which a Putnam client is known to be a party, or
which transaction may have a significant relationship to any action
taken by a Putnam client.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

It shall be the responsibility of every Putnam employee to make inquiry
prior to any personal transaction sufficient to satisfy himself that the
requirements of this Rule have been met.


COMMENT

This rule is required by federal law. It does not prohibit a Putnam
employee from purchasing any shares of an open-end Putnam fund. The
policy with respect to employee trading in closed-end Putnam funds is
attached as Appendix B.

Rule 6

Putnam employees may not hold shares of Putnam open-end U.S. mutual
funds other than through accounts maintained at Putnam through Putnam
Preferred Access (PPA). Employees placing purchase orders in shares of
Putnam open-end funds must place such orders through Putnam and not
through an outside broker or other intermediary. Employees redeeming or
exchanging shares of Putnam open-end funds must place those orders
through Putnam and not through an outside broker or other intermediary.
Contact a PPA representative at 1-800-634-1590 for instructions on how
to transfer these funds.

NOTE:

For purposes of this Rule, "employee" includes:

* Members of the immediate family of a Putnam employee who share the
same household as the employee or for whom the Putnam employee has
investment discretion (family member);

* Any trust in which a Putnam employee or family member is a trustee
with investment discretion and in which such Putnam employee or any
family member are collectively beneficiaries;

* Any closely-held entity (such as a partnership, limited liability
company, or corporation) in which a Putnam employee and his or her
family members hold a controlling interest and with respect to which
they have investment discretion; and

* Any account (including any retirement, pension, deferred compensation,
or similar account) in which a Putnam employee or family member has a
substantial economic interest and over which said Putnam employee or
family member exercises investment discretion.


COMMENTS

* These requirements also apply to self-directed IRA accounts holding
Putnam fund shares.

* For Putnam Profit Sharing Plan or other Putnam deferred compensation
accounts, trades may continue to be placed through ibenefitcenter.com.

* These Rules apply to variable insurance accounts, which invest in
Putnam Variable Trust such as the Putnam/Hartford Capital Manager.
Employees must designate Putnam Retail Management as the broker of
record for all such accounts.


EXCEPTION

Retirement, pension, deferred compensation and similar accounts that
cannot be legally transferred to Putnam are not subject to the
requirement. For example, a spouse of a Putnam employee may have a
401(k) plan with her employer that invests in Putnam funds. Any employee
who continues to hold shares in open-end Putnam funds outside of Putnam
must notify the Code of Ethics Officer in writing of the account
information, provide the reason why the account cannot be transferred to
Putnam and arrange for a quarterly statement of transaction in such
account to be sent to the Code of Ethics Administrator.

Rule 7

(a) Employees defined in Rule 6 may not, within a 90-calendar day
period, make a purchase followed by a sale, or a sale followed by a
purchase, of shares of the same open-end Putnam mutual fund even if the
transactions occur in different accounts.

(b) Employees who are Access Persons may not, within a one-year period,
make a purchase followed by a sale, or a sale followed by a purchase, of
shares of the same open-end Putnam mutual fund or of shares of any U.S.
registered mutual fund to which Putnam acts as advisor or sub-advisor
even if the transactions occur in different accounts.


COMMENTS

* This restriction applies across all accounts maintained by an employee
as follows:

An employee who buys shares of an open-end Putnam mutual fund may not
sell any shares of the same mutual fund until 90 calendar days have
passed.

Example. If an employee buys shares of a Putnam fund on Day 1 for a
retail account and then sells (by exchange) shares of the same fund for
his or her Putnam Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan account on Day 85, the
employee has violated the rule.

Similarly, an employee who sells shares of an open-end Putnam mutual
fund may not buy any shares of the same mutual fund until 90 calendar
days have passed.

Example. If an employee sells shares of a Putnam fund on day 1 for a
retail account and then sells (by exchange out) shares of the same fund
for his or her Putnam Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan account on day 85, the
employee may not buy (or exchange in) shares of that fund in any account
until day 176, which is more than 90 days after the most recent sale of
shares of that fund.

* The purpose of these blackout periods restriction is to prevent any
market timing, or appearance of market timing activity.

* This Rule applies to transactions by a Putnam employee in any type of
account, including retail, IRA, variable annuity, college savings 529
plans, Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan, and any deferred compensation
accounts.

* The minimum sanction for an initial violation of the blackout period
shall be disgorgement of any profit made on the transaction. Additional
sanctions may apply, including termination of employment.


EXCEPTIONS

A. This restriction does not apply to Putnam's money market funds and
Putnam Stable Value Fund.

B. Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan Contributions and Payroll Deductions. The
90-day restriction is not triggered by initial allocation of regular
employee or employer contributions or forfeitures to an employee's
account under the terms of Putnam employee benefit plans or a Putnam
payroll deduction direct investment program; later exchanges of these
contributions will be subject to the 90-day blackout period.

C. Systematic Programs. This restriction does not apply with respect to
shares sold or acquired as a result of participation in a systematic
program for contributions, withdrawals or exchanges, provided that an
election to participate in any such program and the participation dates
of the program may not be changed more often than quarterly after the
program is elected by the employee. Access Persons may elect a quarterly
or semiannual rebalancing program although it may only be changed on an
annual basis;

D. Employee Benefit Plan Withdrawals and Distributions. This restriction
does not apply with respect to shares sold for withdrawals, loans or
distributions under the terms of Putnam employee benefit plans;

E. Dividends, Distributions, Mergers, and Share Class Conversions. This
restriction does not apply with respect to the requisitioned shares as a
result of reinvestment of dividends, distributions, mergers, conversions
of share classes, or other similar actions. Subsequent transactions with
respect to the shares will be covered.

F. In special situations, Putnam's Code of Ethics Oversight Committee
may grant exceptions to the blackout periods as a result of death,
disability, or special circumstances (such as, personal hardship), all
as determined from time to time by the Committee. Employees can request
an exception by submitting a written request to the Code of Ethics
Officer.

Rule 8: Good Until Canceled Orders

Good Until Canceled (GTC) Orders and Limit Orders are prohibited.

Any order not executed on the day of pre-clearance must be resubmitted
for pre-clearance before being executed on a subsequent day. "Good until
canceled" or "limit" orders are prohibited because of the potential
failure to pre-clear.

Rule 9: Excessive Trading

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in excessive
trading for their personal accounts. Beginning with the fourth quarter
of 2004, employees will be prohibited from making more than 25 trades in
individual securities in any given quarter. Excessive trading within
Putnam open-end mutual funds is prohibited.


COMMENTS

* Although a Putnam employee's excessive trading may not itself
constitute a conflict of interest with Putnam clients, Putnam believes
that its clients' confidence in Putnam will be enhanced and the
likelihood of Putnam achieving better investment results for its clients
over the long term will be increased if Putnam employees rely on their
investment-- as opposed to trading-- skills in transactions for their
own account. Moreover, excessive trading by a Putnam employee for his or
her own account diverts an employee's attention from the responsibility
of servicing Putnam clients, and increases the possibilities for
transactions that are in actual or apparent conflict with Putnam client
transactions. Short-term trading is strongly discouraged while employees
are encouraged to take a long-term view.

* Employees should be aware that their trading activity is closely
monitored. Ten trades or more per quarter will be discouraged and will
warrant a review memo. Activity exceeding 25 trades per quarter will be
prohibited by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee. Sanctions will be
imposed such as a trading ban or a more stringent sanction may be
determined at the discretion of the Committee. Different rules apply
with respect to trading in shares of Putnam open-end mutual funds. See
Section I. B, Rule 7 above.

C. Discouraged Transactions

Rule 1

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in writing
(selling) naked options for their personal accounts.

Naked option transactions are particularly dangerous, because a Putnam
employee may be prevented by the restrictions in this Code of Ethics
from covering the naked option at the appropriate time. All employees
should keep in mind the limitations on their personal securities trading
imposed by this Code when contemplating such an investment strategy.
Engaging in naked options transactions on the basis of material,
nonpublic information is prohibited. See Appendix A, Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

D. Exempted Transactions

Rule 1

Transactions that are involuntary on the part of a Putnam employee are
exempt from the prohibitions set forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* This exemption is based on categories of conduct that the Securities
and Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

* Examples of involuntary personal securities transactions include:

(a) Sales out of the brokerage account of a Putnam employee as a result
of bona fide margin call, provided that withdrawal of collateral by the
Putnam employee within the ten days previous to the margin call was not
a contributing factor to the margin call;

(b) Purchases arising out of an automatic dividend reinvestment program
of an issuer of a publicly traded security.

* Transactions by a trust in which the Putnam employee (or a member of
his immediate family) holds a beneficial interest, but for which the
employee has no direct or indirect influence or control with respect to
the selection of investments, are involuntary transactions. In addition,
these transactions do not fall within the definition of "personal
securities transactions." See Definitions.

* A good-faith belief on the part of the employee that a transaction was
involuntary will not be a defense to a violation of the Code of Ethics.
In the event of confusion as to whether a particular transaction is
involuntary, the burden is on the employee to seek a prior written
determination of the applicability of this exemption. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination appear in Section VII, Part 4.

Rule 2

Transactions that have been determined in writing by the Code of Ethics
Officer before the transaction occurs to be no more than remotely
harmful to Putnam clients because the transaction would be very unlikely
to affect a highly institutional market, or because the transaction is
clearly not related economically to the securities to be purchased,
sold, or held by a Putnam client, are exempt from the prohibitions set
forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.


IMPLEMENTATION

An employee may seek an ad-hoc exemption under this Rule by following
the procedures in Section VII, Part 4.


COMMENTS

* This exemption is also based upon categories of conduct that the
Securities and Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

* The burden is on the employee to seek a prior written determination
that the proposed transaction meets the standards for an ad hoc
exemption set forth in this Rule.


SECTION II
Additional Special Rules for Personal Securities Transactions of Access
Persons and Certain Investment Professionals

Access Persons (including all investment professionals and other
employees as defined on page vii)

Rule 1: 60-Day Rule

No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a profit, or sell and
then repurchase at a lower price, any security or related derivative
security within 60 calendar days.


EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior written approval from the Code of Ethics Officer is
obtained. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis when no
abuse is involved and the equities of the situation support an
exemption. For example, although an Access Person may buy a stock as a
long-term investment, that stock may have to be sold involuntarily due
to unforeseen activity such as a merger.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. The 60-Day Rule applies to all Access Persons, as defined in the
Definitions section of the Code.

B. Calculation of whether there has been a profit is based upon the
market prices of the securities. The calculation is not net of
commissions or other sales charges.

C. As an example, an Access Person would not be permitted to sell a
security at $12 that he purchased within the prior 60 days for $10.
Similarly, an Access Person would not be permitted to purchase a
security at $10 that she had sold within the prior 60 days for $12.


COMMENTS

* The prohibition against short-term trading profits by Access Persons
is designed to minimize the possibility that they will capitalize
inappropriately on the market impact of trades involving a client
portfolio about which they might possibly have information.

* Although chief investment officers, portfolio managers, and analysts
may sell securities at a profit within 60 days of purchase in order to
comply with the requirements of the 7-Day Rule applicable to them
(described below), the profit will have to be disgorged to charity under
the terms of the 7-Day Rule.

* Effective in the fourth quarter of 2004, the 60-Day Rule will become a
Black Out Rule. An Access Person cannot trade a security within 60 days
regardless of tax lot election.

Certain Investment Professionals

Rule 2: 7-Day Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: Before a portfolio manager (including a chief
investment officer with respect to an account he manages) places an
order to buy a security for any Putnam client portfolio that he manages,
he shall sell any such security or related derivative security purchased
in a transaction for his personal account within the preceding seven
calendar days.

(b) Comanagers: Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a
security for any Putnam client he manages, his comanager shall sell any
such security or related derivative security purchased in a transaction
for his personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.

(c) Analysts: Before an analyst makes a buy recommendation for a
security (including designation of a security for inclusion in the
portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund), he shall sell any such security
or related derivative security purchased in a transaction for his
personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.


COMMENTS

* This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including chief investment
officers (CIO) with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with
any purchase (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even so-called "clone accounts"). In
particular, it should be noted that the requirements of this Rule also
apply with respect to purchases in client accounts, including "clone
accounts," resulting from "cash flows." To comply with the requirements
of this Rule, it is the responsibility of each portfolio manager or CIO
to be aware of the placement of all orders for purchases of a security
by client accounts that he or she manages for seven days following the
purchase of that security for his or her personal account.

* An investment professional who must sell securities to be in
compliance with the 7-Day Rule must absorb any loss and disgorge to
charity any profit resulting from the sale. The recipient charity will
be chosen by the Code of Ethics Officer.

* This Rule is designed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest between an investment professional and a Putnam client. A
greater burden is placed on these professionals given their positions in
the organization. Transactions executed for the employee's personal
account must be conducted in a manner consistent with the Code of Ethics
and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of
interest or any abuse of the employee's position of trust and
responsibility.

* "Portfolio manager" is used in this Section as a functional label, and
is intended to cover any employee with authority to authorize a trade on
behalf of a Putnam client, whether or not such employee bears the title
"portfolio manager." "Analyst" is also used in this Section as a
functional label, and is intended to cover any employee who is not a
portfolio manager but who may make recommendations regarding investments
for Putnam clients.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 3: Blackout Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager (including a chief
investment officer with respect to an account she manages) shall: (i)
sell any security or related derivative security for her personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since the most recent
purchase of that security or related derivative security by any Putnam
client portfolio she manages or comanages; or (ii) purchase any security
or related derivative security for her personal account until seven
calendar days have elapsed since the most recent sale of that security
or related derivative security from any Putnam client portfolio that she
manages or comanages.

(b) Analysts: No analyst shall: (i) sell any security or related
derivative security for his personal account until seven calendar days
have elapsed since his most recent buy recommendation for that security
or related derivative security (including designation of a security for
inclusion in the portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund); or (ii)
purchase any security or related derivative security for his personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since his most recent
sell recommendation for that security or related derivative security
(including the removal of a security from the portfolio of the Putnam
Research Fund).


COMMENTS

* This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including chief investment
officers with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with any
purchase (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even clone accounts). In particular, it should
be noted that the requirements of this rule also apply with respect to
transactions in client accounts, including clone accounts, resulting
from cash flows. In order to comply with the requirements of this Rule,
it is the responsibility of each portfolio manager and CIO to be aware
of all transactions in a security by client accounts that he or she
manages that took place within the seven days preceding a transaction in
that security for his or her personal account.

* This Rule is designed to prevent a Putnam portfolio manager or analyst
from engaging in personal investment conduct that appears to be counter
to the investment strategy she is pursuing or recommending on behalf of
a Putnam client.

* Trades by a Putnam portfolio manager for her personal account in the
"same direction" as the Putnam client portfolio she manages, and trades
by an analyst for his personal account in the same direction as his
recommendation, do not present the same danger, so long as any same
direction trades do not violate other provisions of the Code or the
Policy Statements.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 4: Contra Trading Rule

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager shall, without prior
clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or related
derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio that he
manages or comanages

(b) Chief Investment Officers: No chief investment officer shall,
without prior clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or
related derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio
managed in his investment group.


EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior clearance and written approval are given.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Individuals Authorized to Give Approval. Prior to engaging in any
such sale, a portfolio manager shall seek approval, in writing, of the
proposed sale. In the case of a portfolio manager or director, prior
written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from a chief
investment officer to whom he reports or, in his absence, another chief
investment officer. In the case of a chief investment officer, prior
written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from another
chief investment officer. In addition to the foregoing, prior written
approval must also be obtained from the Code of Ethics Officer.

B. Contents of Written Approval. In every instance, the written approval
form attached as Appendix C (or such other form as the Code of Ethics
Officer shall designate) shall be used. The written approval should be
signed by the chief investment officer giving approval and dated the
date such approval was given, and shall state, briefly, the reasons why
the trade was allowed and why the investment conduct pursued by the
portfolio manager, director, or chief investment officer was deemed
inappropriate for the Putnam client account controlled by the individual
seeking to engage in the transaction for his personal account. Such
written approval shall be sent by the chief investment officer approving
the transaction to the Code of Ethics Officer, for her approval, within
24 hours or as promptly as circumstances permit. Approvals obtained
after a transaction has been completed or while it is in process will
not satisfy the requirements of this Rule.


COMMENT

This Rule, like Rule 3 of this Section, is designed to prevent a Putnam
portfolio manager from engaging in personal investment conduct that
appears to be counter to the investment strategy that he is pursuing on
behalf of a Putnam client.

Rule 5

No portfolio manager shall cause, and no analyst shall recommend, a
Putnam client to take action for the portfolio manager's or analyst's
own personal benefit.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* A portfolio manager who trades in, or an analyst who recommends,
particular securities for a Putnam client account in order to support
the price of securities in his personal account, or who "front runs" a
Putnam client order is in violation of this Rule. Portfolio managers and
analysts should be aware that this Rule is not limited to personal
transactions in securities (as that word is defined in Definitions).
Thus, a portfolio manager or analyst who front runs a Putnam client
purchase or sale of obligations of the U.S. government is in violation
of this Rule, although U.S. government obligations are excluded from the
definition of security.

* This Rule is not limited to instances when a portfolio manager or
analyst has malicious intent. It also prohibits conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety. Portfolio managers and analysts who have
questions about whether proposed conduct creates an appearance of
impropriety should seek a prior written determination from the Code of
Ethics Officer, using the procedures described in Section VII, Part 3.


SECTION III

General Rules for All Employees

Rule 1: Compliance with All Laws, Regulations and Policies

All employees must comply with applicable laws and regulations as well
as company policies. This includes tax, anti-trust, political
contribution, and international boycott laws. In addition, no employee
at Putnam may engage in fraudulent conduct of any kind.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* Putnam may report to the appropriate legal authorities conduct by
Putnam employees that violates this Rule.

* It should also be noted that the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
makes it a criminal offense to make a payment or offer of payment to any
non-U.S. governmental official, political party, or candidate to induce
that person to affect any governmental act or decision, or to assist
Putnam's obtaining or retaining business.

Rule 2: Conflicts of Interest

No Putnam employee shall conduct herself in a manner, which is contrary
to the interests of, or in competition with, Putnam or a Putnam client,
or which creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest with a
Putnam client.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* This Rule is designed to recognize the fundamental principle that
Putnam employees owe their chief duty and loyalty to Putnam and Putnam
clients.

* It is expected that a Putnam employee who becomes aware of an
investment opportunity that she believes is suitable for a Putnam client
who she services will present it to the appropriate portfolio manager,
prior to taking advantage of the opportunity herself.

Rule 3: Gifts and Entertainment Policy

No Putnam employee shall accept anything of material value from any
broker-dealer, financial institution, corporation or other entity, any
existing or prospective supplier of goods or services with a business
relationship to Putnam, or any company or other entity whose securities
are held in or are being considered as investments for the Putnam funds,
or any other client account. Included are gifts, favors, preferential
treatment, special arrangements, or access to special events.


COMMENTS

This Rule is intended to permit the acceptance of only proper types of
customary and limited business amenities.

A Putnam employee may not, under any circumstances, accept anything that
could create the appearance of any kind of conflict of interest. For
example, acceptance of any consideration is prohibited if it would
create the appearance of a reward or inducement for conducting Putnam
business either with the person providing the gift or his employer.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. Gifts. An employee may not accept small gifts with an aggregate value
of more than $100 in any year from any one source. Any Putnam employee
who is offered or receives an item exceeding $100 in value is prohibited
by this Rule and must report the details to the Code of Ethics Officer.
Any entertainment event provided to an employee where the host is not in
attendance is treated as a gift and is subject to the $100 per year per
source limit.

B. Entertainment. Putnam's rules are designed to permit reasonable,
ordinary business entertainment, but prohibit any events, which may be
perceived as extravagant or involving lavish expenditures.

1. Occasional lunches, dinners, cocktail parties, or comparable
gatherings conducted for business purposes are permitted.

For example, occasional attendance at group functions sponsored by sell
side firms is permitted where the function relates to investments or
other business activity. Occasional attendance at these functions is not
required to be counted against the limits described in paragraph 2(b)
below.

2. Other entertainment events, such as, sporting events, theater,
movies, concerts, or other forms of entertainment conducted for business
purposes, are permitted only under the following conditions:

(i) The host must be present for the event.

(ii) The location of the event must be in the metropolitan area in which
the office of the employee is located.

(iii) Spouses or other family members of the employee may not attend the
entertainment event or any meals before or after the entertainment
event.

(iv) The value of the entertainment event provided to the employee may
not exceed $150, not including the value of any meals that may be
provided to the employee before or after the event.

Acceptance of entertainment events having a market value materially
exceeding the face value of the entertainment including, for example,
attendance at sporting event playoff games, is prohibited. This
prohibition applies even if the face value of tickets to the events is
$150 or less or when the Putnam employee offers to pay for the tickets.
If there is any ambiguity about whether to accept an entertainment event
in these circumstances, please consult the Code of Ethics Officer.

(v) The employee may not accept entertainment events under this
provision (B)(2) more than six times a year and not more than two times
in any year from any single source.

(vi) The Code of Ethics Officer may grant exceptions to these rules. For
example, it may be appropriate for an employee attending a legitimate
conference in a location away from the office to attend a business
entertainment event in that location. All exceptions must be approved in
advance by written request to the Code of Ethics Officer.

3. Any employee attending any entertainment event under (B)(1) or (B)(2)
above must file a Report of Entertainment Form (attached as Appendix E)
with the Code of Ethics Officer within 10 days following the date of the
entertainment event. Failure to file the notice is a violation of the
Code of Ethics.

4. Meals and entertainment, which are part of the regular program at an
investment conference (i.e., open to all participants) are not subject
to the limits of this section (B)(2) above.

C. Among the items that are prohibited are:

1. Any entertainment event attendance, which would reflect badly on
Putnam as a firm of the highest fiduciary and ethical standards. For
example, events involving adult entertainment or gambling must be
avoided.

2. Entertainment involving travel away from the metropolitan area in
which the employee is located. Even in the event an exception is granted
as contemplated by (B)(2)(vi) above, payment by a third party of the
cost of transportation to a location outside the employee's metropolitan
area, lodging while in another location, and any meals not specifically
approved by the Code of Ethics officer, are prohibited;

3. Personal loans to a Putnam employee on terms more favorable than
those generally available for comparable credit standing and collateral;
and

4. Preferential brokerage or underwriting commissions or spreads or
allocations of shares or interests in an investment for the personal
account of a Putnam employee; and

5. Cash or cash equivalents

D. As with any of the provisions of the Code of Ethics, a sincere belief
by the employee that he was acting in accordance with the requirements
of this Rule will not satisfy his obligations under the Rule. Therefore,
an employee who is in doubt concerning the propriety of any gift or
favor should seek a prior written determination from the Code of Ethics
Officer, as provided in number 3 of Section VII.

E. No Putnam employee may solicit any gift or entertainment from any
person, even if the gift or entertainment, if unsolicited, would be
permitted.

F. The Rule does not prohibit employees on business travel from using
local transportation and arrangements customarily supplied by brokers or
similar entities. For example, it is customary for brokers in developing
markets to make local transportation arrangements. These arrangements
are permitted so long as the expense of lodging and air travel are paid
by Putnam.

Rule 4: Anti-bribery/Kickback Policy

No Putnam employee shall pay, offer, or commit to pay any amount of
consideration which might be or appear to be a bribe or kickback in
connection with Putnam's business.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

Although the rule does not specifically address political contributions
(which are described in Rule 5 below), Putnam employees should be aware
that it is against corporate policy to use company assets to fund
political contributions of any sort, even where such contributions may
be legal. No Putnam employee should offer or agree to make any political
contributions (including political dinners and similar fundraisers) on
behalf of Putnam, and no employee will be reimbursed by Putnam for such
contributions made by the employee personally.

Rule 5: Political Contributions/Solicitations Policy

No contributions may be made with corporate funds to any political party
or campaign, whether directly or by reimbursement to an employee for the
expense of such a contribution. No Putnam employee shall solicit any
charitable, political, or other contributions using Putnam letterhead or
making reference to Putnam in the solicitation. No Putnam employee shall
personally solicit any such contribution while on Putnam business.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* Putnam has established a political action committee (PAC) that
contributes to worthy candidates for political office. Any request
received by a Putnam employee for a political contribution must be
directed to Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department.

* This rule prohibits solicitation on personal letterhead by Putnam
employees except as approved by the Code of Ethics Officer.

* Certain officers and employees of Putnam Retail Management and other
employees involved in Putnam's College Advantage Section 529 Plan with
Ohio Tuition Trust Authority are subject to special rules on political
contributions. For questions on these requirements, please call the Code
of Ethics Administrator.

Rule 6: Confidentiality of Putnam Business Information

No unauthorized disclosure may be made by any employee or former
employee of any trade secrets or proprietary information of Putnam or of
any confidential information. No information regarding any Putnam client
portfolio, actual or proposed securities trading activities of any
Putnam client, or Putnam research shall be disclosed outside the Putnam
organization unless doing so has a valid business purpose and is in
accord with any relevant procedures established by Putnam relating to
such disclosures.


COMMENT

All information about Putnam and Putnam clients is strictly
confidential. Putnam research information should not be disclosed
without proper approval and never for personal gain.

Rule 7: Roles At Other Entities

No Putnam employee shall serve as officer, employee, director, trustee,
or general partner of a corporation or entity other than Putnam, without
prior approval of the Code of Ethics Officer. Requests for a role at a
publicly-traded company will be closely reviewed and permission will be
granted on an ad-hoc basis.


EXCEPTION

Charitable or Non-profit Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as officer, director, or trustee of a
charitable or not-for-profit institution, provided that the employee
abides by the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements with respect to
any investment activity for which she has any discretion or input as
officer, director, or trustee. The pre-clearance and reporting
requirements of the Code of Ethics do not apply to the trading
activities of such charitable or not-for-profit institutions for which
an employee serves as an officer, director, or trustee unless the
employee is responsible for day-to-day portfolio management of the
account.


COMMENTS

* This Rule is designed to ensure that Putnam cannot be deemed an
affiliate of any issuer of securities by virtue of service by one of its
officers or employees as director or trustee.

* Positions with public companies are especially problematic and will
normally not be approved.

* Certain charitable or not-for-profit institutions have assets (such as
endowment funds or employee benefit plans) which require prudent
investment. To the extent that a Putnam employee (because of her
position as officer, director, or trustee of an outside entity) is
charged with responsibility to invest such assets prudently, she may not
be able to discharge that duty while simultaneously abiding by the
spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements. Employees are
cautioned that they should not accept service as an officer, director,
or trustee of an outside charitable or not-for-profit entity where such
investment responsibility is involved, without seriously considering
their ability to discharge their fiduciary duties with respect to such
investments.

Rule 8: Role as Trustee or Fiduciary Outside of Putnam

No Putnam employee shall serve as a trustee, executor, custodian, any
other fiduciary, or as an investment advisor or counselor for any
account outside Putnam.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Charitable or Religious Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a religious or
charitable trust or foundation, so long as the employee abides by the
spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements with respect to
any investment activity over which he has any discretion or input. The
pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code of Ethics do not
apply to the trading activities of such a religious or charitable trust
or foundation unless the employee is responsible for day-to-day
portfolio management of the account.

B. Family Trust or Estate Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a family trust
or estate, so long as the employee abides by all of the Rules of the
Code of Ethics with respect to any investment activity over which he has
any discretion.


COMMENT

The roles permissible under this Rule may carry with them the obligation
to invest assets prudently. Once again, Putnam employees are cautioned
that they may not be able to fulfill their duties in that respect while
abiding by the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements.

Rule 9: Investment Clubs

No Putnam employee may be a member of any investment club.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

This Rule guards against the danger that a Putnam employee may be in
violation of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements by virtue of
his personal securities transactions in or through an entity that is not
bound by the restrictions imposed by this Code of Ethics and the Policy
Statements. Please note that this restriction also applies to the spouse
of a Putnam employee and any relatives of a Putnam employee living in
the same household as the employee, as their transactions are covered by
the Code of Ethics (see page vii).

Rule 10: Business Negotiations For Putnam

No Putnam employee may become involved in a personal capacity in
consultations or negotiations for corporate financing, acquisitions, or
other transactions for outside companies (whether or not held by any
Putnam client), nor negotiate nor accept a fee in connection with these
activities without obtaining the prior written permission of the
president of Putnam Investments.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 11: Accurate Records

No employee may create, alter or destroy (or participate in the
creation, alteration or destruction of) any record that is intended to
mislead anyone or to conceal anything that is, or is reasonably believed
to be, improper. In addition, all employees responsible for the
preparation, filing, or distribution of any regulatory filings or public
communications must ensure that such filings or communications are
timely, complete, fair, accurate, and understandable.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

* In many cases, this is not only a matter of company policy and ethical
behavior but also required by law. Our books and records must accurately
reflect the transactions represented and their true nature. For example,
records must be accurate as to the recipient of all payments; expense
items, including personal expense reports, must accurately reflect the
true nature of the expense. No unrecorded fund or asset shall be
established or maintained for any reason.

* All financial books and records must be prepared and maintained in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Putnam's
existing accounting controls, to the extent applicable.

Rule 12: Interest in Entities Doing Business with Putnam

No employee shall have any direct or indirect (including by a family
member or close relative) personal financial interest (other than normal
investments not material to the employee in the entity's publicly-traded
securities) in any business, with which Putnam has dealings unless such
interest is disclosed and approved by the Code of Ethics Officer.

Rule 13: Affiliated Entities

No employee shall, with respect to any affiliate of Putnam that provides
investment advisory services and is listed below in Comment 4 to this
Rule, as revised from time to time (each a Non-Putnam affiliate or NPA),

(a) Directly or indirectly seek to influence the purchase, retention, or
disposition of, or exercise of voting consent, approval or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security in any account or fund
advised by the NPA and not by Putnam,

(b) Transmit any information regarding the purchase, retention or
disposition of, or exercise of voting, consent, approval, or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security held in a Putnam or NPA
client account to any personnel of the NPA,

(c) Transmit any trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential
information of Putnam to the NPA unless doing so has a valid business
purpose and is in accord with any relevant procedures established by
Putnam relating to such disclosures,

(d) Use confidential information or trade secrets of the NPA for the
benefit of the employee, Putnam, or any other NPA, or

(e) Breach any duty of loyalty to the NPA derived from the employee's
service as a director or officer of the NPA.


COMMENTS

* Sections (a) and (b) of the Rule are designed to help ensure that the
portfolio holdings of Putnam clients and clients of the NPA need not be
aggregated for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act or applicable regulatory or
contractual investment restrictions that incorporate such definition of
beneficial ownership. Persons who serve as directors or officers of both
Putnam and an NPA should take care to avoid even inadvertent violations
of Section (b). Section (a) does not prohibit a Putnam employee who
serves as a director or officer of the NPA from seeking to influence the
modification or termination of a particular investment product or
strategy in a manner that is not directed at any specific securities.
Sections (a) and (b) do not apply when a Putnam affiliate serves as an
advisor or sub-advisor to the NPA or one of its products, in which case
normal Putnam aggregation rules apply.

* As a separate entity, any NPA may have trade secrets or confidential
information that it would not choose to share with Putnam. This choice
must be respected.

* When Putnam employees serve as directors or officers of an NPA, they
are subject to common law duties of loyalty to the NPA, despite their
Putnam employment. In general, this means that when performing their
duties as NPA directors or officers, they must act in the best interest
of the NPA and its shareholders. Putnam's Legal and Compliance
Department will assist any Putnam employee who is a director or officer
of an NPA and has questions about the scope of his or her
responsibilities to the NPA.

* Entities that are currently non-Putnam affiliates within the scope of
this Rule are: Cisalpina Gestioni, S.p.A., Nissay Asset Management Co.,
Ltd., Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., Ampega Asset Management, GMBH, and
Sceptre Investment Counsel, Ltd.

Rule 14: Computer System/Network Policies

No employee shall use computer hardware, software, data, Internet,
electronic mail, voice mail, electronic messaging (e-mail or cc: Mail),
or telephone communications systems in a manner that is inconsistent
with their use as set forth in policy statements governing their use
that are adopted from time to time by Putnam. No employee shall
introduce a computer virus or computer code that may result in damage to
Putnam's information or computer systems.


COMMENT

Putnam's policy statements relating to these matters are contained in
the Computer System and Network Responsibilities section of the
Employment Issues category within the Employee Handbook. The online
Employee Handbook is located online at www.ibenefitcenter.com under
Policies and Procedures under the @Putnam tab.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 15: AIMR Code of Ethics

All employees must follow and abide by the spirit of the Code of Ethics
and the Standards of Professional Conduct of the Association of
Investment Management and Research (AIMR). The texts of the AIMR Code of
Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct are set forth in Exhibit D.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

Rule 16: Privacy Policy

Except as provided below, no employee may disclose to any outside
organization or person any nonpublic personal information about any
individual who is a current or former shareholder of any Putnam retail
or institutional fund, or current or former client of a Putnam company.
All employees shall follow the security procedures as established from
time to time by a Putnam company to protect the confidentiality of all
shareholder and client account information.

Except as Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department may expressly
authorize, no employee shall collect any nonpublic personal information
about a prospective or current shareholder of a Putnam Fund or
prospective or current client of a Putnam company, other than through an
account application (or corresponding information provided by the
shareholder's financial representative) or in connection with executing
shareholder or client transactions, nor shall any information be
collected other than the following: name, address, telephone number,
Social Security number, and investment, broker, and transaction
information.


EXCEPTIONS

A. Putnam Employees. Nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to
Putnam employees in connection with processing transactions or
maintaining accounts for shareholders of a Putnam fund and clients of a
Putnam company, to the extent that access to such information is
necessary to the performance of that employee's job functions.

B. Shareholder Consent Exception. Nonpublic personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to a non-Putnam
organization at the specific request of the shareholder or client or
with the shareholder's or client's prior written consent.

C. Broker or Advisor Exception. Nonpublic personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to the shareholder's
or client's broker of record.

D. Third-Party Service Provider Exception. Nonpublic personal
information may be disclosed to a service provider that is not
affiliated with a Putnam fund or Putnam company only when such
disclosure is necessary for the service provider to perform the specific
services contracted for, and only (a) if the service provider executes
Putnam's standard confidentiality agreement, or (b) pursuant to an
agreement containing a confidentiality provision that has been approved
by the Legal and Compliance Department. Examples of such service
providers include proxy solicitors and proxy vote tabulators, mail
services, and providers of other administrative services, and
Information Services Division consultants who have access to nonpublic
personal information.


COMMENTS

* Nonpublic personal information is any information that personally
identifies a shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam company
and is not derived from publicly available sources. This privacy policy
applies to shareholders or clients who are individuals, not
institutions. However, as a general matter, all information that we
receive about a shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam
company shall be treated as confidential. No employee may sell or
otherwise provide shareholder or client lists or any other information
relating to a shareholder or client to any marketing organization.

* All Putnam employees with access to shareholder or client account
information must be trained in and follow Putnam's security procedures
designed to safeguard that information from unauthorized use. For
example, a telephone representative must be trained in and follow
Putnam's security procedures to verify the identity of a caller
requesting account information.

* Any questions regarding this privacy policy should be directed to
Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department. A violation of this policy
will be subject to the sanctions imposed for violations of Putnam's Code
of Ethics.

* Employees must report any violation of this policy or any possible
breach of the confidentiality of client information (whether intentional
or accidental) to the managing director in charge of the employee's
business unit. Managing directors who are notified of such a violation
or possible breach must immediately report it in writing to Putnam's
chief compliance officer and, in the event of a breach of computerized
data, Putnam's chief technology officer.

Rule 17: Anti-money Laundering Policy

No employee may engage in any money laundering activity or facilitate
any money-laundering activity through the use of any Putnam account or
client account. Any situations giving rise to a suspicion that attempted
money laundering may be occurring in any account must be reported
immediately to the managing director in charge of the employee's
business unit. Managing directors who are notified of such a suspicion
of money laundering activity must immediately report it in writing to
Putnam's chief compliance officer and chief financial officer.

Rule 18: Record Retention

All employees must comply with the record retention requirements
applicable to the business unit. Employees should check with their
managers or the chief administrative officer of their division to
determine what record retention requirements apply to their business
unit.


SECTION IV

Special Rules for Officers and Employees of Putnam Investments Limited

Rule 1

In situations subject to Section I.A., Rule 1 (Restricted List Personal
Securities Transactions, the Putnam Investments Limited (PIL) employee
must obtain clearance not only as provided in that rule, but also from
PIL's Compliance Officer or her designee, who must approve the
transaction before any trade is placed and record the approval.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

Putnam's Code of Ethics Administrator in Boston (the Boston
Administrator) has also been designated the Assistant Compliance Officer
of PIL and has been delegated the right to approve or disapprove
personal securities transactions in accordance with the requirements of
Section I.A. Therefore, approval from the Code of Ethics Administrator
for PIL employees to make personal securities investments constitutes
approval under the Code of Ethics and also for purposes of compliance
with the Financial Services Authority, the U.K. self-regulatory
organization that regulates PIL.

The position of London Code of Ethics Administrator (the London
Administrator) has also been created (Jane Barlow is the current London
Administrator). All requests for clearances must be made by e-mail to
the Boston Administrator copying the London Administrator. The e-mail
must include the number of shares to be bought or sold and the name of
the broker(s) involved. Where time is of the essence clearances may be
made by telephone to the Boston Administrator but they must be followed
up by e-mail.

Both the Boston and London Administrators will maintain copies of all
clearances for inspection by senior management and regulators.

Rule 2

No PIL employee may trade with any broker or dealer unless that broker
or dealer has sent a letter to the London Administrator agreeing to
deliver copies of trade confirmations and statements to PIL. No PIL
employee may enter into any margin or any other special dealing
arrangement with any broker-dealer without the prior written consent of
the PIL compliance officer.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

PIL employees will be notified separately of this requirement once a
year by the PIL compliance officer, and are required to provide an
annual certification of compliance with the Rule.

All PIL employees must inform the London Administrator of the names of
all brokers and dealers with whom they trade prior to trading. The
London Administrator will send a letter to the broker(s) in question
requesting them to agree to deliver copies of confirms to PIL. The
London Administrator will forward copies of the confirms to the Boston
Administrator. PIL employees may trade with a broker only when the
London Administrator has received the signed agreement from that broker.

Rule 3

For purposes of the Code of Ethics, including Putnam's Policy Statement
on Insider Trading Prohibitions, PIL employees must also comply with
Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on insider dealing.


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

To ensure compliance with UK insider dealing legislation, PIL employees
must observe the relevant procedures set forth in PIL's Compliance
Manual, a copy of which is sent to each PIL employee, and sign an annual
certification as to compliance.


SECTION V

Reporting Requirements for All Employees

Reporting of Personal Securities Transactions

Rule 1

Each Putnam employee shall ensure that copies of all confirmations for
securities transactions for his personal brokerage accounts, and,
beginning in the fourth quarter 2004, brokerage account statements are
sent to the Putnam Compliance Department's (Code of Ethics
Administrator). (For the purpose of this Rule, securities shall also
include ETFs, futures, and other derivatives on broad-based market
indexes excluded from the pre-clearance requirement.) Statements and
confirmations are required for Putnam funds not held at PPA or in a
Putnam retirement plan, as well as for U.S. mutual funds sub-advised by
Putnam.


EXCEPTION

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Putnam employees must instruct their broker-dealers to send
statements and confirmations to Putnam and must follow up with the
broker-dealer on a reasonable basis to ensure that the instructions are
being followed. For brokerage accounts, Putnam employees should contact
the Code of Ethics Administrator to obtain a letter from Putnam
authorizing the setting up of a personal brokerage account.

B. Statements and confirmations should be submitted to the Code of
Ethics Administrator.

C. Specific procedures apply to employees of PIL. Employees of PIL
should contact the London Code of Ethics Administrator.

D. Failure of a broker-dealer to comply with the instructions of a
Putnam employee to send confirmations shall be a violation by the Putnam
employee of this Rule. Similarly, failure by an employee to report the
existence of a personal account (and, if the account is opened after
joining Putnam, failure to obtain proper authorization to establish the
account) shall be a violation of this Rule.

E. Statements and confirmations must also be sent for members of an
employees' immediate family, including statements received with respect
to a family member's 401(k) plan at another employer.


COMMENTS

* Transactions for personal accounts is defined broadly to include more
than transaction in accounts under an employee's own name. See
Definitions.

* Statements and confirmations are required for all personal securities
transactions, whether or not exempted or excepted by this Code.

* To the extent that a Putnam employee has investment authority over
securities transactions of a family trust or estate, confirmations of
those transactions must also be made, unless the employee has received a
prior written exception from the Code of Ethics Officer.

Rule 2

Every Access Person shall file a quarterly report, within ten calendar
days of the end of each quarter, recording all purchases and sales of
any securities for personal accounts as defined in the Definitions. (For
the purpose of this Rule, "securities" shall include exchange traded
funds (ETF), futures, and any option on a security or securities index,
including broad-based market indexes excluded from the pre-clearance
requirement and also includes transactions in Putnam open-end funds if
the account for the Putnam funds is not held at PPA or in a Putnam
retirement plan and for transactions in U.S. mutual funds sub-advised by
Putnam.)


EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

All employees required to file such a report will receive by e-mail a
blank form at the end of the quarter from the Code of Ethics
Administrator. The form will specify the information to be reported. The
form shall also contain a representation that employees have complied
fully with all provisions of the Code of Ethics.


COMMENTS

* The date for each transaction required to be disclosed in the
quarterly report is the trade date for the transaction, not the
settlement date.

* If the requirement to file a quarterly report applies to you and you
fail to report within the required 10-day period, salary increases and
bonuses will be reduced in accordance with guidelines stated in the
form. It is the responsibility of the employee to request an early
report if he has knowledge of a planned absence, i.e., vacation or
business trip.

Reporting of Personal Securities Holdings

Rule 3

Access Persons must disclose all personal securities holdings to the
Code of Ethics Officer upon commencement of employment within ten
calendar days of hire and thereafter on an annual basis. This
requirement is mandated by SEC regulations and is designed to facilitate
the monitoring of personal securities transactions. Putnam's Code of
Ethics Administrator will provide Access Persons with the form for
making these reports and the specific information that must be disclosed
at the time that the disclosure is required.

Reporting Irregular Activity

Rule 4

If a Putnam employee suspects that fraudulent, illegal, or other
irregular activity (including violations of the Code of Ethics) might be
occurring at Putnam, the activity should be reported immediately to the
managing director in charge of that employee's business unit. Managing
directors who are notified of any such activity must immediately report
it in writing to Putnam's financial officer and Putnam's Chief
Compliance Officer.

An employee who does not feel comfortable reporting this activity to the
relevant managing director may instead contact the chief compliance
officer, the Putnam or MMC Ethics hotlines or the ombudsman.

Rule 5

Putnam has established a formal Office of the Ombudsman as an additional
mechanism for an employee to report an impropriety or conduct that is
not in line with the company's value system. The ombudsman is a person
who is authorized to receive complaints or questions confidentially
about alleged acts, omissions, improprieties, and broader systemic
problems within the organization. Communication with the Ombudsman is
confidential.


SECTION VI

Education Requirements

Every Putnam employee has an obligation to fully understand the
requirements of the Code of Ethics. The Rules set forth below are
designed to enhance this understanding.

Rule 1

A copy of the Code of Ethics will be distributed to every Putnam
employee periodically. All Access Persons will be required to certify
annually that they have read, understood, and will comply with the
provisions of the Code of Ethics, including the Code's Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.

Rule 2

Every employee will annually be required to complete training on
Putnam's Code of Ethics.


SECTION VII

Compliance and Appeal Procedures

A. Assembly of Restricted List

The Code of Ethics Administrator will coordinate the assembly and
maintenance of the Restricted List. The list will be assembled each day
by 11:30 a.m. No employee may engage in a personal securities
transaction without prior clearance on any day, even if the employee
believes that the trade will be subject to an exception. Note that
pre-clearance may be obtained after 9:00 a.m. for purchases or sales of
up to 1,000 shares of issuers having a market capitalization in excess
of $5 billion.

B. Consultation of Restricted List

It is the responsibility of each employee to pre-clear through the
pre-clearance system or consult with the Code of Ethics Administrator
prior to engaging in a personal securities transaction, to determine if
the security he proposes to trade is on the Restricted List and, if so,
whether it is subject to the large-cap exception. The pre-clearance
system and the Code of Ethics Administrator will be able to tell an
employee whether a security is on the Restricted List. No other
information about the Restricted List is available through the
pre-clearance system. The Code of Ethics Administrator shall not be
authorized to answer any questions about the Restricted List, or to
render an opinion about the propriety of a particular personal
securities transaction. Any such questions shall be directed to the Code
of Ethics Officer.

C. Request for Determination

An employee who has a question concerning the applicability of the Code
of Ethics to a particular situation shall request a determination from
the Code of Ethics Officer before engaging in the conduct or personal
securities transaction about which he has a question.

If the question pertains to a personal securities transaction, the
request shall state for whose account the transaction is proposed, the
relationship of that account to the employee, the security proposed to
be traded, the proposed price and quantity, the entity with whom the
transaction will take place (if known), and any other information or
circumstances of the trade that could have a bearing on the Code of
Ethics Officer's determination. If the question pertains to other
conduct, the request for determination shall give sufficient information
about the proposed conduct to assist the Code of Ethics Officer in
ascertaining the applicability of the Code. In every instance, the Code
of Ethics Officer may request additional information, and may decline to
render a determination if the information provided is insufficient.

The Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to render a
determination promptly.

No perceived ambiguity in the Code of Ethics shall excuse any violation.
Any person who believes the Code to be ambiguous in a particular
situation shall request a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer.

D. Request for Ad Hoc Exemption

Any employee who wishes to obtain an ad hoc exemption under Section
I.D., Rule 2, shall request from the Code of Ethics Officer an exemption
in writing in advance of the conduct or transaction sought to be
exempted. In the case of a personal securities transaction, the request
for an ad hoc exemption shall give the same information about the
transaction required in a request for determination under number 3 of
this section, and shall state why the proposed personal securities
transaction would be unlikely to affect a highly institutional market,
or is unrelated economically to securities to be purchased, sold, or
held by any Putnam client. In the case of other conduct, the request
shall give information sufficient for the Code of Ethics Officer to
ascertain whether the conduct raises questions of propriety or conflict
of interest (real or apparent).

The Code of Ethics Officer shall make reasonable efforts to promptly
render a written determination concerning the request for an ad hoc
exemption.

E. Appeal to Code of Ethics Officer with Respect to Restricted List

If an employee ascertains that a security that he wishes to trade for
his personal account appears on the Restricted List, and thus the
transaction is prohibited, he may appeal the prohibition to the Code of
Ethics Officer by submitting a written memorandum containing the same
information as would be required in a request for a determination. The
Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to respond to the appeal
promptly.

F. Information Concerning Identity of Compliance Personnel

The names of Code of Ethics personnel are available by contacting the
Legal and Compliance Department and will be published on Putnam's Web
site.

APPENDIX A: Policy Statement Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions


PREAMBLE

Putnam has always forbidden trading on material nonpublic information
(inside information) by its employees. Tough federal laws make it
important for Putnam to state that prohibition in the strongest possible
terms, and to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.

Unlawful trading while in possession of inside information can be a
crime. Federal law provides that an individual convicted of trading on
inside information may go to jail for a period of time. There is also
significant monetary liability for an inside trader; the Securities and
Exchange Commission can seek a court order requiring a violator to pay
back profits, as well as penalties substantially greater than those
profits. In addition private plaintiffs can seek recovery for harm
suffered by them. The inside trader is not the only one subject to
liability. In certain cases, controlling persons of inside traders
(including supervisors of inside traders or Putnam itself ) can be
liable for large penalties.

Section 1 of this Policy Statement contains rules concerning inside
information. Section 2 contains a discussion of what constitutes
unlawful insider trading.

Neither material nonpublic information nor unlawful insider trading is
easy to define. Section 2 of this Policy Statement gives a general
overview of the law in this area. However, the legal issues are complex
and must be resolved by the Code of Ethics Officer. If an employee has
any doubt as to whether she has received material nonpublic information,
she must consult with the Code of Ethics Officer prior to using that
information in connection with the purchase or sale of a security for
his own account or the account of any Putnam client, or communicating
the information to others. A simple rule of thumb is if you think the
information is not available to the public at large, don't disclose it
to others and don't trade securities to which the inside information
relates. An employee aware of or in possession of inside information
must report it immediately to the Code of Ethics Officer. If an employee
has failed to consult the Code of Ethics Officer, Putnam will not excuse
employee misuse of inside information on the ground that the employee
claims to have been confused about this Policy Statement or the nature
of the information in his possession.

If Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an employee has
failed to abide by this Policy Statement, or has engaged in conduct that
raises a significant question concerning insider trading, he will be
subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

There are no exceptions to this policy statement and no one is exempt.

APPENDIX A

The individual designated by the Code of Ethics Officer to assume
responsibility for day-to-day, non-discretionary administration of this
Policy Statement.

The Putnam officer who has been assigned the responsibility of enforcing
and interpreting this Policy Statement. The Code of Ethics Officer shall

the chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. If he or she is
unavailable, the Deputy Code of Ethics Officer (to be appointed by the
Code of Ethics Officer) shall act in his or her stead.

be a Putnam company.

Putnam client

Any of the Putnam Funds, or any advisory or trust client of Putnam.

Putnam employee (or employee)

Anything defined as a security under federal law. The term includes any
type of equity or debt security, any interest in a business trust or
partnership, and any rights relating to a security, such as put and call
options, warrants, convertible securities, and securities indices.
(Note: The definition of security in this Policy Statement varies
significantly from that in the Code of Ethics. For example, the
definition in this Policy Statement specifically includes all securities
of any type.)

Transaction for a personal account (or personal securities transaction)

Securities transactions: (a) for the personal account of any employee;
(b) for the account of a member of the immediate family of any employee;
(c) for the account of a partnership in which a Putnam employee or
immediate family member is a partner with investment discretion; (d) for
the account of a trust in which a Putnam employee or immediate family
member is a trustee with investment discretion; (e) for the account of a
closely-held corporation in which a Putnam employee or immediate family
member holds shares and for which he has investment discretion; and (f )
for any account other than a Putnam client account which receives
investment advice of any sort from the employee or immediate family
member, or as to which the employee or immediate family member has
investment discretion. Officers and employees of PIL must also consult
the relevant procedures on compliance with U.K. insider dealing
legislation set forth in PIL's Compliance Manual (See Rule 3 of Section
IV of the Code of Ethics).


APPENDIX A

SECTION I: Rules Concerning Inside Information

Rule 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security listed on the
Inside Information List (the Red List) either for his personal account
or for a Putnam client.


IMPLEMENTATION

When an employee contacts the Code of Ethics Administrator seeking
clearance for a personal securities transaction, the Code of Ethics
Administrator's response as to whether a security appears on the
Restricted List will include securities on the Red List.


COMMENT

This Rule is designed to prohibit any employee from trading a security
while Putnam may have inside information concerning that security or the
issuer. Every trade, whether for a personal account or for a Putnam
client, is subject to this Rule.

Rule 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security, either for a
personal account or for the account of a Putnam client, while in
possession of material, nonpublic information concerning that security
or the issuer, without the prior written approval of the Code of Ethics
Officer.


IMPLEMENTATION

In order to obtain prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer,
a Putnam employee should follow the reporting steps prescribed in Rule 3.

COMMENTS

* Rule 1 concerns the conduct of an employee when Putnam possesses
material nonpublic information. Rule 2 concerns the conduct of an
employee who herself possesses material, nonpublic information about a
security that is not yet on the Red List.

* If an employee has any question as to whether information she
possesses is material and/or nonpublic information, she must contact the
Code of Ethics Officer in accordance with Rule 3 prior to purchasing or
selling any security related to the information or communicating the
information to others. The Code of Ethics Officer shall have the sole
authority to determine what constitutes material, nonpublic information
for the purposes of this Policy Statement.

Rule 3

Any Putnam employee who believes he may have received material,
nonpublic information concerning a security or the issuer shall
immediately report the information to the Code of Ethics Officer, the
Deputy Code of Ethics Officer or, in their absence, the general counsel
and to no one else. After reporting the information, the Putnam employee
shall comply strictly with Rule 2 by not trading in the security without
the prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer and shall: (a)
take precautions to ensure the continued confidentiality of the
information; and (b) refrain from communicating the information in
question to any person.


IMPLEMENTATION

A. In order to make any use of potential material, nonpublic
information, including purchasing or selling a security or communicating
the information to others, an employee must communicate that information
to the Code of Ethics Officer in a way designed to prevent the spread of
such information. Once the employee has reported potential material,
nonpublic information to the Code of Ethics Officer, the Code of Ethics
Officer will evaluate whether information constitutes material,
nonpublic information, and whether a duty exists that makes use of such
information improper. If the Code of Ethics Officer determines either
(a) that the information is not material or is public, or (b) that use
of the information is proper, he will issue a written approval to the
employee specifically authorizing trading while in possession of the
information, if the employee so requests. If the Code of Ethics Officer
determines (a) that the information may be nonpublic and material, and
(b) that use of such information may be improper, he will place the
security that is the subject of such information on the Red List.

B. An employee who reports potential inside information to the Code of
Ethics Officer should expect that the Code of Ethics Officer will need
significant information (and time to gather such information) to make
the evaluation described in the foregoing paragraph, including
information about (a) the manner in which the employee acquired the
information, and (b) the identity of individuals to whom the employee
has revealed the information, or who have otherwise learned the
information. In appropriate situations, the Code of Ethics Officer shall
place the affected security or securities on the Red List pending the
completion of his evaluation.

C. If an employee possesses documents, disks, or other materials
containing the potential inside information, an employee must take
precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the information in
question. Those precautions include (a) putting documents containing
such information out of the view of a casual observer, and (b) securing
files containing such documents or ensuring that computer files
reflecting such information are secure from viewing by others.

D. Members of the executive board of directors and members of chief
financial officer's staff may not trade securities of MMC in the period
from the end of each calendar quarter to the date of announcement of
MMC's earnings for such quarter.


COMMENTS

While all employees must pre-clear trades of MMC securities and make
sure they are not in possession of material inside information about MMC
when trading, certain employees who may receive information about
Putnam's earnings are subject to the rules above concerning trading
black out periods.


APPENDIX A

SECTION II: Overview of Insider Trading

Introduction

This section of the Policy Statement provides guidelines for employees
as to what may constitute inside information. It is possible that in the
course of her employment, an employee may receive inside information. No
employee should misuse that information, either by trading for her own
account or by communicating the information to others.

What constitutes unlawful insider trading?

The basic definition of unlawful insider trading is trading on material,
nonpublic information (also called inside information) by an individual
who has a duty not to take advantage of the information. The following
sections help explain the definition.

What is material information?

Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the
information is material. Information is material if a reasonable person
would attach importance to the information in determining his course of
action with respect to a security. Information that is reasonably likely
to affect the price of a company's securities is material, but effect on
price is not the sole criterion for determining materiality. Information
that employees should consider material includes but is not limited to:
dividend changes, earnings estimates, changes in previously released
earnings estimates, reorganization, recapitalization, asset sales, plans
to commence a tender offer, merger or acquisition proposals or
agreements, major litigation, liquidity problems, significant contracts,
and extraordinary management developments.

Material information does not have to relate to a company's business.
For example, a court considered as material certain information about
the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that was expected to
affect the market price of a security. In that case, a reporter for The
Wall Street Journal was found criminally liable for disclosing to others
the dates that reports on various companies would appear in the
Journal's "Heard on the Street" column and whether those reports would
be favorable or not.

What is nonpublic information?

Information is nonpublic until it has been effectively communicated to,
and sufficient opportunity has existed for it to be absorbed by, the
marketplace. One must be able to point to some fact to show that the
information is generally public. For example, information found in a
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or appearing
in Dow Jones, Reuters Economic Services, The Wall Street Journal, or
other publications of general circulation would be considered public.

Who has a duty not to "take advantage" of inside information?

Unlawful insider trading occurs only if there is a duty not to take
advantage of material nonpublic information. When there is no such duty,
it is permissible to trade while in possession of such information.
Questions as to whether a duty exists are complex, fact-specific, and
must be answered by a lawyer.

Insiders and Temporary Insiders

Corporate insiders have a duty not to take advantage of inside
information. The concept of insider is broad. It includes officers,
directors, and employees of a corporation. In addition, a person can be
a temporary insider if she enters into a special confidential
relationship with a corporation and as a result is given access to
information concerning the corporation's affairs. A temporary insider
can include, among others, accounting firms, consulting firms, law
firms, banks, and the employees of such organizations. Putnam would
generally be a temporary insider of a corporation it advises or for
which it performs other services, because typically Putnam clients
expect Putnam to keep any information disclosed to it confidential.


EXAMPLE

An investment advisor to the pension fund of a large publicly-traded
corporation, Acme, Inc., learns from an Acme employee that Acme will not
be making the minimum required annual contribution to the pension fund
because of a serious downturn in Acme's financial situation. The
information conveyed is material and nonpublic.


COMMENT

Neither the investment advisor or its employees, nor its clients can
trade on the basis of that information, because the investment advisor
and its employees could be considered "temporary insiders" of Acme.

Misappropriators

Certain people who are not insiders (or temporary insiders) also have a
duty not to deceptively take advantage of inside information. Included
in this category is an individual who misappropriates (or takes for his
own use) material, nonpublic information in violation of a duty owed
either to the corporation that is the subject of inside information or
some other entity. Such a misappropriator can be held liable if he
trades while in possession of that material, nonpublic information.


EXAMPLE

The Chief Investment Officer of Acme, Inc., is aware of Acme's plans to
engage in a hostile takeover of Profit, Inc. The proposed hostile
takeover is material and nonpublic.


COMMENT

The Chief Investment Officer of Acme cannot trade in Profit, Inc.'s
stock for his own account. Even though he owes no duty to Profit, Inc.,
or its shareholders, he owes a duty to Acme not to take advantage of the
information about the proposed hostile takeover by using it for his
personal benefit.

Tippers and Tippees

A person (the tippee) who receives material, nonpublic information from
an insider or misappropriator (the tipper) has a duty not to trade while
in possession of that information if he knew or should have known that
the information was provided by the tipper for an improper purpose and
in breach of a duty owed by the tipper. In this context, it is an
improper purpose for a person to provide such information for personal
benefit, such as money, affection, or friendship.


EXAMPLE

The Chief Executive Officer of Acme, Inc., tells his daughter that
negotiations concerning a previously announced acquisition of Acme have
been terminated. This news is material and, at the time the father tells
his daughter, nonpublic. The daughter sells her shares of Acme.


COMMENT

The father is a tipper because he has a duty to Acme and its
shareholders not to take advantage of the information concerning the
breakdown of negotiations, and he has conveyed the information for an
improper purpose (here, out of love and affection for his daughter). The
daughter is a tippee and is liable for trading on inside information
because she knew or should have known that her father was conveying the
information to her for his personal benefit, and that her father had a
duty not to take advantage of Acme information.

A person can be a tippee even if he did not learn the information
directly from the tipper, but learned it from a previous tippee.


EXAMPLE

An employee of a law firm which works on mergers and acquisitions learns
at work about impending acquisitions. She tells her friend and her
friend's stockbroker about the upcoming acquisitions on a regular basis.
The stockbroker tells the brother of a client on a regular basis, who in
turn tells two friends, A and B. A and B buy shares of the companies
being acquired before public announcement of the acquisition, and
regularly profit from such purchases. A and B do not know the employee
of the law firm. They do not, however, ask about the source of the
information.


COMMENT

A and B, although they have never heard of the tipper, are tippees
because they did not ask about the source of the information, even
though they were experienced investors, and were aware that the "tips"
they received from this particular source were always right.

Who can be liable for insider trading?

The categories of individuals discussed above (insiders, temporary
insiders, misappropriators, or tippees) can be liable if they trade
while in possession of material nonpublic information.

In addition, individuals other than those who actually trade on inside
information can be liable for trades of others. A tipper can be liable
if (a) he provided the information in exchange for a personal benefit in
breach of a duty, and (b) the recipient of the information (the tippee)
traded while in possession of the information.

Most importantly, a controlling person can be liable if the controlling
person knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the controlled
person was likely to engage in misuse of inside information and failed
to take appropriate steps to prevent it. Putnam is a controlling person
of its employees. In addition, certain supervisors may be controlling
persons of those employees they supervise.


EXAMPLE

A supervisor of an analyst learns that the analyst has, over a long
period of time, secretly received material inside information from Acme,
Inc.'s Chief Investment Officer. The supervisor learns that the analyst
has engaged in a number of trades for his personal account on the basis
of the inside information. The supervisor takes no action.


COMMENT

Even if he is not liable to a private plaintiff, the supervisor can be
liable to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a civil penalty of
up to three times the amount of the analyst's profit. (Penalties are
discussed in the following section.)

Penalties for insider trading

Penalties for misuse of inside information are severe, both for
individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers. A
person who violates the insider trading laws can be subject to some or
all of the types penalties below, even if he does not personally benefit
from the violation. Penalties include:

* Jail sentences, criminal monetary penalties.

* Injunctions permanently preventing an individual from working in the
securities industry.

* Injunctions ordering an individual to pay over profits obtained from
unlawful insider trading.

* Civil penalties substantially greater than the profit gained or loss
avoided by the trader, even if the individual paying the penalty did not
trade or did not benefit personally.

* Civil penalties for the employer or other controlling person.

* Damages in the amount of actual losses suffered by other participants
in the market for the security at issue.

Regardless of whether penalties or money damages are sought by others,
Putnam will take whatever action it deems appropriate (including
dismissal) if Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an
employee appears to have committed any violation of this Policy
Statement, or to have engaged in any conduct which raises significant
questions about whether an insider trading violation has occurred.


APPENDIX B: Policy Statement Regarding Employee Trades in Shares of
Putnam Closed-End Funds

Pre-clearance for all employees

Any purchase or sale of Putnam closed-end fund shares by a Putnam
employee must be pre-cleared by the Code of Ethics Officer or, in his
absence, the Deputy Code of Ethics Officer. A list of the closed-end
funds can be obtained from the Code of Ethics Administrator. The
automated pre-clearance system is not available for Putnam closed-end
fund clearance. Trading in shares of closed-end funds is subject to all
the rules of the Code of Ethics. Contact the Code of Ethics
Administrator with these pre-clearance requests.

Special Rules Applicable to Managing Directors of Putnam Investment
Management, LLC and officers of the Putnam Funds.

Please be aware that any employee who is a managing director of Putnam
Investment Management, Inc. (the investment manager of the Putnam mutual
funds) and officers of the Putnam Funds will not receive clearance to
engage in any combination of purchase and sale or sale and purchase of
the shares of a given closed-end fund within six months of each other.
Therefore, purchases should be made only if you intend to hold the
shares more than six months; no sales of fund shares should be made if
you intend to purchase additional shares of that same fund within six
months.

You are also required to file certain forms with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with purchases and sales of Putnam
closed-end funds. Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer
Administrator for further information.

Reporting by all employees

As with any purchase or sale of a security, duplicate confirmations of
all such purchases and sales must be forwarded to the Code of Ethics
Officer by the broker-dealer utilized by an employee. If you are
required to file a quarterly report of all personal securities
transactions, this report should include all purchases and sales of
closed-end fund shares.

Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer or Deputy Code of Ethics
Officer if there are any questions regarding these matters.

before their own.

* Make a reasonable inquiry into a client's financial situation,
investment experience, and investment objectives prior to making any
investment recommendations and shall update this information as
necessary, but no less frequently than annually, to allow the members to

benefit received by the member or delivered to others for the
recommendation of any services to the client or prospect.

Relationships with and Responsibilities to the Public

PROHIBITION AGAINST USE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION

Members who possess material nonpublic information related to the value
of a security shall not trade or cause others to trade in that security
if such trading would breach a duty or if the information was
misappropriated or relates to a tender offer. If members receive
material nonpublic information in confidence, they shall not breach that
confidence by trading or causing others to trade in securities to which
such information relates. Members shall make reasonable efforts to
achieve public dissemination of material nonpublic information disclosed
in breach of a duty.


PERFORMANCE PRESENTATION

Members shall not make any statements, orally or in writing, that

Supplement - dated December 15, 2004 to Putnam Code of Ethics

The Putnam Code of Ethics Oversight Committee has approved the following
amendments to the August 2004 Code of Ethics.

Sanctions Guidelines

The Sanctions Guidelines in Section 1A of the Code (page 4 of August
Code) have been withdrawn and are replaced with the following new
Sanctions Guidelines effective with the first quarter of  2005:

"The Code of Ethics Oversight Committee is responsible for setting
sanctions policies for violating the Code. The Committee has adopted the
following minimum monetary sanctions for violations of the Code.  These
sanctions apply even if the exception results from inadvertence rather
than intentional misbehavior.  The Code of Ethics Officer is authorized
to impose the minimum sanction on employees without further Committee
action.  However, the sanctions noted below are only minimums and the
Committee reserves the right to impose additional sanctions such as
higher monetary sanctions, trading bans, suspension or termination of
employment as it determines to be  appropriate.

The minimum sanction for a violation of the following Rules is
disgorgement of any profits or payment of avoided losses and the
following payments:

Section IA, Rule 1 (Pre-clearance and Restricted List)
Section IB, Rule 1 (Short-selling)
Section IB, Rule 2 (IPOs)
Section IB, Rule 3 (Private Placements)
Section IB, Rule 4 (Trading with Inside Information)
Section IB, Rules 6-8 (Holding and trading of Putnam Funds)
Section II, Rule 2 (7-Day Rule)
Section II, Rule 3 (Black-out Rule)
Section II, Rule 4, (Contra-Trading Rule)
Section II, Rule 5 (Trading for personal benefit)


Officer Level    SMD/MD         SVP/VP         AVP/non-officer
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st violation     $500           $250           $50
2nd             $1,000           $500          $100
3rd             Minimum monetary sanction as above with ban on all new
                personal individual investments.

The minimum sanction for violations of all other rules in the Code is as
follows:

Officer Level    SMD/MD         SVP/VP         AVP/non-officer
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st violation     $100            $50           $25
Subsequent        $200           $100           $50

The reference period for determining whether a violation is initial or
subsequent will be five years.

Excessive Trading

Effective with the 2nd quarter of 2005, the maximum number of trades
permitted in individual securities per quarter is reduced from 25 to 10.
Section 1B, Rule 9 is effective April 1, 2005, will read as follows:

"Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in excessive
trading for their personal accounts.  Beginning in the second quarter of
2005, employees will be prohibited from making more than 10 trades in
individual securities in any given quarter.  Excessive trading within
Putnam open-end funds is prohibited."

Access Persons; Holding Period for Individual Securities

Effective with the 2nd quarter of 2005, the holding period rule for
Access Person investments in individual securities will increase from 60
to 90 days.  Section II, Rule 1 will read, effective April 1, 2005 as
follows:

"No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a profit, or sell and
then repurchase at a lower price, any security or related derivative
security with 90 calendar days."

Access Person Reporting

The deadline by which Access Persons are required to file quarterly
statements of all transactions has been increased from 10 to 15 calendar
days after the end of each quarter.  This change will be effective in
the April, 2005 filing.  Accordingly Section V, Rule 2, will now read as
follows:

"Every Access Person shall file a quarterly report within 15 calendar
days of the end of each quarter, recording all purchases and sales of
any securities for personal accounts as defined in the Definitions. (For
purposes of this Rule, securities shall include exchange traded funds
(ETFs), futures and any option on a security or securities index,
including broad based market indices excluded from the pre-clearance
requirement and also includes transactions in Putnam open-end funds if
the account for the Putnam funds is not held at Putnam Securities
Services or in a Putnam retirement plan and for transactions in US
mutual funds sub-advised by Putnam."

As required by new SEC rule 204A-1, the definition of Access Persons
under the Code has been amended, effective February 1, 2005 to include
Putnam employees with access to non public information about affiliated

    regarding the portfolio holdings of any Putnam advised or sub-advised
    mutual fund.

Each employee will be informed if he or she is considered an Access

                             THE PUTNAM FUNDS

                              Code of Ethics

Each of The Putnam Funds (the "Funds") has determined to adopt this Code
of Ethics with respect to certain types of personal securities
transactions by officers and Trustees of the Funds which might be deemed
to create possible conflicts of interest and to establish reporting
requirements and enforcement procedures with respect to such
transactions.

I. Rules Applicable to Officers and Trustees Affiliated with Putnam
Investments Trust or Its Subsidiaries

A. Incorporation of Adviser's Code of Ethics.  The provisions of the
Code of Ethics for employees of Putnam Investments Trust and its
subsidiaries (the "Putnam Investments Code of Ethics"), which is
attached as Appendix A hereto, are hereby incorporated herein as the
Funds' Code of Ethics applicable to officers and Trustees of the Funds
who are employees of the Funds or officers, directors or employees of
Putnam Investments Trust or its subsidiaries.  A violation of the Putnam
Investments' Code of Ethics shall constitute a violation of the Funds'
Code.

B. Reports.  Officers and Trustees of each of the Funds who are made
subject to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics pursuant to the
preceding paragraph shall file the reports required by the Putnam
Investments' Code of Ethics with the Code of Ethics Officer designated
therein.  A report filed with the Code of Ethics Officer shall be deemed
to be filed with each of the Funds of which the reporting individual is
an officer or Trustee.

C. Review and Reporting.

(1) The Code of Ethics Officer shall cause the reported personal
securities transactions to be compared with completed and contemplated
portfolio transactions of each of the Funds to determine whether a
violation of this Code may have occurred.  Before making any
determination that a violation has been committed by any person, the
Code of Ethics Officer shall give such person an opportunity to supply
additional explanatory material.

(2) If the Code of Ethics Officer determines that a violation of any
provision of this Code has or may have occurred, he shall submit his
written determination, together with any additional explanatory
material, to the Audit and Pricing Committee of the Funds at its next
meeting.

D. Sanctions.  In addition to reporting violations of this Code to the
Audit and Pricing Committee of the Funds as provided in Section I-C(2),
the Code of Ethics officer shall also report to such Committee any
sanctions imposed with respect to such violations.  The Committee
reserves the right to impose such additional sanctions as it deems
appropriate.

II. Rules Applicable to Unaffiliated Trustees

A. Definitions.

(1) "Beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in the same manner as it
would be in determining whether a person is subject to the provisions of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(2) "Control" means the power to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the
result of an official position with such company.

(3) "Interested Trustee" means a Trustee of a Fund who is an "interested
person" of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

(4) "Purchase or sale of a security" includes, among other things, the
writing of an option to purchase or sell a security.

(5) "Security" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act (in effect, all securities)
except that it shall not include securities issued by the Government of
the United States or an agency thereof, bankers' acceptances, bank
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and high-quality short-term
debt investments, including repurchase agreements, and shares of
registered open-end investment companies, but shall include any security
convertible into or exchangeable for a security.

(6) "Unaffiliated Trustee" means a Trustee who is not made subject to
the Putnam Investments Code of Ethics pursuant to Part I hereof.

B. Prohibited Purchases and Sales.  No Unaffiliated Trustee of any of
the Funds shall purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, any security
in which he has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any direct
or indirect beneficial ownership and which to his actual knowledge at
the time of such purchase or sale:

(1) is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund;

(2) is being purchased or sold by the Fund; or

(3) was purchased or sold by the Fund within the most recent five days
if such person participated in the recommendation to, or the decision
by, Putnam Investment Management to purchase or sell such security for
the Fund.

C. Exempted Transactions.  The prohibitions of Section II-B of this Code
shall not apply to:

(1) purchases or sales of securities effected in any account over which
the Unaffiliated Trustee has no direct or indirect influence or control;

(2) purchases or sales of securities which are non-volitional on the
part of either the Unaffiliated Trustee or the Fund;

(3) purchases of securities which are part of an automatic dividend
reinvestment plan;

(4) purchases of securities effected upon the exercise of rights issued
by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to
the extent such rights were acquired from such issuer, and sales of such
rights so acquired;

(5) purchases or sales of securities other than those exempted in (1)
through (4) above which do not cause the Unaffiliated Trustee to gain
improperly a personal benefit through his relationship with the Fund and
are only remotely potentially harmful to a Fund because they would be
very unlikely to affect a highly institutional market, and are
previously approved by the Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer of the
Funds, in consultation with the Code of Ethics Officer, which approval
shall be confirmed in writing.

D. Reporting.

(1) Whether or not one of the exemptions listed in Section II-C applies
and except as provided in Section II-C(5), every Unaffiliated Trustee of
a Fund shall file with the Funds' Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer a
report containing the information described in Section II-D(2) of this
Code with respect to purchases or sales of any security in which such
Unaffiliated Trustee has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any
direct or indirect beneficial ownership, if such Trustee, at the time of
that transaction, knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his
official duties as a Trustee of the Fund, should have known that, during
the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the
transaction by the Trustee:

(a) such security was or is to be purchased or sold by the Fund or

(b) such security was or is being considered for purchase or sale by the
Fund;

provided, however, that an Unaffiliated Trustee shall not be required to
make a report with respect to transactions effected for any account over
which such person does not have any direct or indirect influence or
control.

(2) Every report shall be made not later than 10 days after the end of
the calendar quarter in which the transaction to which the report
relates was effected, and shall contain the following information:

(a) The date of the transaction, the title, the number of shares, the
interest rate and maturity date (if applicable) and the principal amount
of each security involved;

(b) The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any other
type of acquisition or disposition);

(c) The price at which the transaction was effected; and

(d) The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the
transaction was effected; and

(e) the date that the report is submitted by each Unaffiliated Trustee.

(3) Every report concerning a purchase or sale prohibited under Section
II-B hereof with respect to which the reporting person relies upon one
of the exemptions provided in Section II-C shall contain a brief
statement of the exemption relied upon and the circumstances of the
transaction.

(4) Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not be
construed as an admission by the person making such report that he has
any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the security to which the
report relates.

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an
Unaffiliated Trustee who is an "interested person" of the Funds shall
file the reports required by Rule 17j-1(d)(1) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 with the Code of Ethics Officer of Putnam
Investments.  Such reports shall be reviewed by such Officer as provided
in Section I-C(1) and any related violations shall be reported by him to
the Audit and Pricing Committee as provided in Section I-C(2).  The
Committee may impose such additional sanctions as it deems appropriate.

E. Review and Reporting.

(1) The Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer of the Funds, in
consultation with the Code of Ethics Officer of Putnam Investments,
shall cause the reported personal securities transactions that he
receives pursuant to Section II-D(1) to be compared with completed and
contemplated portfolio transactions of the Funds to determine whether
any transaction ("Reviewable Transactions") listed in Section II-B
(disregarding exemptions provided by Section II-C(1) through (5)) may
have occurred.

(2) If the Legal and Compliance Liaison Officer determines that a
Reviewable Transaction may have occurred, he shall then determine
whether a violation of this Code may have occurred, taking into account
all the exemptions provided under Section II-C.  Before making any
determination that a violation has occurred, the Legal and Compliance
Liaison Officer shall give the person involved an opportunity to supply
additional information regarding the transaction in question.

F. Sanctions.  If the Legal and Compliance Liaison determines that a
violation of this Code has occurred, he shall so advise the Funds' Audit
and Pricing Committee, and provide the Committee with a report of the
matter, including any additional information supplied by such person.
The Committee may impose such sanctions as it deems appropriate.

III. Miscellaneous

A. Amendments to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics.  Any amendment
to the Putnam Investments' Code of Ethics shall be deemed an amendment
to Section I-A of this Code effective 30 days after written notice of
such amendment shall have been received by the Chairman of the Funds,
unless the Trustees of the Funds expressly determine that such amendment
shall become effective at an earlier or later date or shall not be
adopted.

B. Records.  The Funds shall maintain records in the manner and to the
extent set forth below, which records may be maintained on microfilm
under the conditions described in Rule 31a-2(f)(1) under the Investment
Company Act and shall be available for examination by representatives of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) A copy of this Code and any other code which is, or at any time
within the past five years has been, in effect shall be preserved in an

Investments' Code of Ethics, Putnam Investments shall maintain such
record on behalf of the Funds as well.

Supplement - dated April 1, 2005 to Putnam's Code of Ethics

The Putnam Code of Ethics Oversight Committee has approved the following
amendments, effective April 1, 2005:

Section III - Rule 12: Interest in Entities Doing Business with Putnam

Family Member Conflicts Policy

No employee or member of an employee's immediate family shall have any
direct or indirect personal financial interests in companies which do
business with Putnam, unless such interest is disclosed and approved by
the Code of Ethics Officer. Investment holdings in public companies
which are not material to the employee are excluded from this
prohibition. The Code also provides more detailed supplemental rules to
address potential conflicts of interests which may arise if members of
employees' families are closely involved in doing business with Putnam.

Corporate purchase of goods and services

Putnam will not acquire goods and services from any firm in which a
member of an employee's immediate family serves as the sales
representative in a senior management capacity or has an ownership
interest with the supplier firm (excluding normal investment holdings in
public companies) without permission from the Director of Procurement
and the Code of Ethics Officer. Any employee who is aware of a proposal
to purchase goods and services from a firm at which a member of the
employee's immediate family meets one of the previously mentioned
conditions must notify the Director of Procurement and the Code of
Ethics Officer.

Portfolio Trading

Putnam will not allocate any trades for a portfolio to any firm that
employs a member of an employee's immediate family as a sales
representative to Putnam (in a primary, secondary or back up role). Any
Putnam employee who is aware that an immediate family member serves as a
broker-dealer's sales representative to Putnam should inform the Code of
Ethics Officer.

Definition of Immediate Family

"Immediate family" of an employee means (1) husband or wife of the
employee, (2) any child, sibling or parent of an employee and any person
married to a child, sibling, or parent of an employee and (3) any other
person who lives in the same household as the employee.

Section III - Rule 5: Political Contributions/Solicitations Policy

Political Activities, Contributions and Lobbying

Corporate Contributions and Solicitation.  Political activities of
corporations such as Putnam are highly regulated, and corporate
political contributions are largely prohibited.  Accordingly, no
contributions may be made with Putnam corporate funds to any political
party or campaign, whether directly or by reimbursement of such a
contribution, unless pre-approved in advance by the Chief Compliance
Officer.  Employee contributions to any pending or proposed client of
Putnam, regardless of whether the employee will seek reimbursement from
Putnam for such contributions, must be pre-approved in advance by the
Chief Compliance Officer. Donations of Putnam property and of employee
time when working for Putnam are also prohibited. No Putnam employee may
make any solicitation for or endorsement of any campaign or candidate
using Putnam letterhead, referencing Putnam, or while on Putnam
business.

Employee Personal Political Contributions. Employees, so long as they do
not use Putnam assets, or state or imply that Putnam is involved in a
campaign, are free to engage in political activities subject to three
restrictions as follows:

1. Some states and localities have laws that prohibit employees from
making political contributions to candidates for state and local office
if their employer has an investment management contract with, or is
seeking one from, the state or locality. Accordingly, Putnam employees
must pre-clear with the Chief Compliance Officer any contributions to
candidates for any of the following offices:

* State or local offices in California
* The office of State Treasurer of Connecticut or Vermont
* State or local offices in New Jersey
* Any local office in the city of Houston, Texas

2. Contributions to state and local officials with whom Putnam has a
business relationship or from whom is seeking a business relationship
must be pre-cleared with the Chief Compliance Officer.

3. Certain employees at PRM involved in the CollegeAdvantage program are
restricted from making contributions to candidates for offices in Ohio
under the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. These
employees are separately identified and informed by Putnam's Compliance
Department of applicable requirements.

Gifts. Employees must obtain pre-approval from the Chief Compliance
Officer prior to providing any gift (including meals, entertainment,
transportation or lodging) to any government official or employee.

Lobbying.  Federal and state law imposes limits and registration
requirements on efforts by individuals and companies to influence the
passage of legislation or to obtain business from governments.
Accordingly, Putnam employees should not engage in any lobbying
activities without approval from Putnam's Director of Government
Relations. Lobbying does not include solicitation of investment
management business through the ordinary course of business, such as
responding to RFPs.
