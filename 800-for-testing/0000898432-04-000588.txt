CHAIRMAN'S LETTER
- -----------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report of the Neuberger Berman
Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc., for the period ending April 30, 2004.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments,
and its financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income, and its
secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation. In seeking to accomplish
both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad mix of equity securities of
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks out real estate securities that are
attractively priced relative to their historical growth rates and the valuation
of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman


PETER SUNDMAN
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE
SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. Portfolio Commentary
- ------------------------------------------------------------

          For the six-month period ending April 30, 2004, on a Net Asset Value
          (NAV) basis, the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund
          Inc. (AMEX: NRO), declined by 4.10%, compared to a gain of 3.35% for
          the NAREIT Equity REIT Index.

          The Fund's performance lagged its benchmark as a result of timing
          issues more than property sector or stock selection. The Fund
          commenced investment operations on October 31, 2003. During its
          initial investing period, which encompassed the period from November
          1, 2003 to January 31, 2004, the NAREIT Index surged 13%. The Fund was
          fully invested by February, but because we were not fully invested
          during this very positive period, we lagged behind the index. The
          Fund's portfolio is well diversified across property sectors and
          geographic regions. We expect improved relative performance going
          forward.

          REITs posted modestly positive performance for the six months ended
          April 30, 2004. The route to that performance, however, was uneven.
          REITs performed strongly during the five-month period from October
          31st to March 31st, but during the month of April experienced a
          decline of nearly 15%. April's weak REIT performance was primarily due
          to a strong jobs report released early in the month, which sparked
          concern over potentially higher interest rates. The fear of higher
          interest rates led to a sell-off in the bond market and subsequently
          ignited a sell-off in the REIT market.

          In our experience, interest rate changes have not significantly
          affected the performance of REITs over long periods of time.
          Correlation studies over the last five, ten, and twenty-five years
          show a very low correlation between REIT performance and the direction
          of interest rates. In addition, during periods when interest rates
          rose for twelve consecutive months, REITs have historically generated
          positive total returns.

          We believe that REIT valuation levels are currently attractive.
          Although we expect interest rates and inflation to move higher over
          the next twelve months, we also expect GDP growth (Gross Domestic
          Product) to remain robust, employment to accelerate and business
          spending to pick up. In our view, these conditions have the potential
          to enhance the REIT industry's earnings power. New supply growth also
          remains in check and we are beginning to see acceleration in demand.
          In this environment, we continue to have a positive view of the
          potential for REIT stock price performance over the next twelve
          months.

          Sincerely,


                               /s/ Steven R. Brown

                                 STEVEN R. BROWN

          Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered.
          There is an initial public offering and once issued, common shares of
          closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

          The composition, industries and holdings of the fund are subject to
          change. Investment return will fluctuate. Past performance is no

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS
- --------------------------------

          +  Investments in securities by the Fund are valued at the latest
             sales price where that price is readily available; securities for
             which no sales were reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at
             the last available bid price on that day. Securities traded
             primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally valued by the
             Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided by
             NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported
             price as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is
             outside the range of the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the
             bid and asked prices that dealers quote to each other when trading
             for their own accounts); in that case, NASDAQ will adjust the price
             to equal the inside bid or asked price, whichever is closer.
             Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may not be based on
             the price of the last trade to occur before the market closes. The
             Fund values all other securities by a method the Board of Directors
             of the Fund (the "Board") believes accurately reflects fair value.
             Numerous factors may be considered when determining the fair value
             of a security, including available analyst, media or other reports,
             trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer of the security
             being fair valued has other securities outstanding. Foreign
             security prices are furnished by independent quotation services
             expressed in local currency values. Foreign security prices are
             translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars using the
             exchange rate as of 12:00 p.m., Eastern time. The Board has
             approved the use of FT Interactive Data Corporation ("FT
             Interactive") to assist in determining the fair value of the Fund's
             foreign equity securities in the wake of certain significant
             events. Specifically, when changes in the value of a certain index
             suggest that the closing prices on the foreign exchanges no longer
             represent the amount that the Fund could expect to receive for
             those securities, FT Interactive will provide adjusted prices for
             certain foreign equity securities based on an analysis showing
             historical correlations between the prices of those securities and
             changes in the index. In the absence of precise information about
             the market values of these foreign securities as of the close of
             the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has determined on the basis
             of available data that prices adjusted in this way are likely to be
             closer to the prices the Fund could realize on a current sale than
             are the prices of those securities established at the close of the
             foreign markets in which the securities primarily trade. However,
             fair value prices are necessarily estimates, and there is no
             assurance that such a price will be at or close to the price at
             which the security next trades. Short-term debt securities with
             less than 60 days until maturity may be valued at cost which, when
             combined with interest earned, approximates market value.

          #  At cost, which approximates market value.

          ## At April 30, 2004, the cost of investments for U.S. Federal income
             tax purposes was $723,217,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of
             investments was $6,707,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of
             investments was $36,688,000, resulting in net unrealized
             depreciation of $29,981,000, based on cost for U.S. Federal income
             tax purposes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

               NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

          1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.
               (the "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August
               28, 2003 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
               company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
               Fund had no operations until October 31, 2003, other than matters
               relating to its organization and the sale on September 26, 2003
               of 6,981 shares of common stock for $100,003 ($14.325 per share)
               to Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), the Fund's sub-adviser.
               The Board of Directors of the Fund may classify or re-classify
               any unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of
               preferred stock without the approval of shareholders.

               The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
               accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
               requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc. ("Management") to make
               estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial
               statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

          2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as
               indicated in the notes following the Schedule of Investments.

          3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities
               transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income
               is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included
               in dividend income, if any, are recorded at the fair market value
               of the securities received. Interest income, including accretion
               of original issue discount, where applicable, and accretion of
               discount on short-term investments, is recorded on the accrual
               basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions and
               foreign currency transactions are recorded on the basis of
               identified cost and stated separately in the Statement of
               Operations.

          4    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to
               qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
               provisions available to certain investment companies, as defined
               in applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code, and to make
               distributions of investment company taxable income and net
               capital gains (after reduction for any amounts available for U.S.
               Federal income tax purposes as capital loss carryforwards)
               sufficient to relieve it from all, or substantially all, U.S.
               Federal income taxes. Accordingly, the Fund paid no U.S. Federal
               income taxes and no provision for U.S. Federal income taxes was
               required.

          5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns
               income, net of expenses, daily on its investments. It is the
               policy of the Fund to declare quarterly and pay monthly
               distributions to common shareholders. The Fund has adopted a
               policy to pay common shareholders a stable distribution. In an
               effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, distributions
               may consist of net investment income, realized gains and paid-in
               capital. The Fund may pay distributions in excess of those
               required by its stable distribution policy to avoid excise tax or
               to satisfy the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal
               Revenue Code. Income dividends and capital gain distributions to
               common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net
               realized capital gains, if any, will be offset by capital loss
               carryforwards. Any

                                       12
<Page>

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

               such offset will not reduce the level of the stable distribution
               paid by the Fund. Dividends and distributions to preferred
               shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

               The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in
               securities issued by real estate companies, including real estate
               investment trusts. After calendar year-end, real estate companies
               often recharacterize the nature of the distributions paid during
               that year, frequently with the result that distributions
               previously identified as income are recharacterized as return of
               capital and/or capital gain. As a result, the composition of the
               Fund's distributions as reported herein may differ from the final
               composition determined after calendar year-end and reported to
               Fund shareholders on Form 1099.

               The Fund distinguishes between dividends on a tax basis and a
               financial reporting basis and only distributions in excess of tax
               basis earnings and profits are reported in the financial
               statements as a tax return of capital. Differences in the
               recognition or classification of income between the financial
               statements and tax earnings and profits which result in temporary
               over-distributions for financial statement purposes are
               classified as distributions in excess of net investment income or
               accumulated net realized gains in the components of net assets on
               the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

               On March 30, 2004, the Fund declared two monthly dividends to
               common shareholders from its net investment income in the amount
               of $0.10 per share per month, payable after this reporting
               period, on May 28, 2004 and June 30, 2004, to shareholders of
               record on May 14, 2004 and June 14, 2004, respectively, with
               ex-dividend dates of May 12, 2004 and June 10, 2004,
               respectively.

               As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings
               (accumulated losses) on a federal income tax basis were as
               follows:

<Table>

                                      UNDISTRIBUTED          CARRY-
                                           ORDINARY        FORWARDS
                                             INCOME   AND DEFERRALS        TOTAL
                                                 <S>             <C>          <C>
                                                 $-              $-           $-
</Table>

               The difference between book basis and tax basis is attributable
               primarily to net operating losses.

          6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Some bills are applicable to multiple funds.
               Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the
               Fund. Expenses borne by the complex of related investment
               companies, which includes open-end and closed-end investment
               companies for which Management serves as investment manager, that
               are not directly attributed to the Fund, are allocated among the
               Fund and the other investment companies in the complex or series
               thereof, on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
               appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in
               the complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

          7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund
               re-classified 12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A
               Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market
               Preferred Shares, Series C Auction Market Preferred Shares and
               Series D Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27,
               2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS, 2,450 Series B AMPS,
               2,450 Series C AMPS

               of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends,
               whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but excluding
               interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

               Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period,
               dividends to preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are
               accrued daily and paid every 7 days for Series A and Series B
               AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS. Dividend
               rates are reset every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and
               every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on the results
               of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the period
               ended April 30, 2004, dividend rates ranged from 1.06% to 1.12%
               for Series A, 1.05% to 1.15% for Series B, 1.07% to 1.10% for
               Series C and 1.09% to 1.11% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared
               dividends to preferred shareholders for the period May 1, 2004 to
               May 31, 2004 of $64,852, $66,098, $59,478 and $61,459 for Series
               A, Series B, Series C and Series D AMPS, respectively.

               The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second
               business day preceding any dividend payment date at Liquidation
               Value. The Fund is also subject to certain restrictions relating
               to the AMPS. Failure to comply with these restrictions could
               preclude the Fund from declaring any distributions to common
               shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could trigger
               the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value. The
               holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless
               otherwise required by law, will vote with holders of common stock
               as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote separately as a
               class on certain matters, as required by law. The holders of the
               AMPS, voting as a separate class, are entitled at all times to
               elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a majority of the
               Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay dividends on AMPS
               for two consecutive years.

          8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
               transactions, with institutions that the Fund's investment
               manager has determined are creditworthy, to reduce the risk that
               an increase in short-term interest rates could reduce common
               share net earnings as a result of leverage. The Fund agrees to
               pay the swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for
               the counter party's paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that
               is intended to approximate all or a portion of the Fund's
               variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's AMPS. The payment
               flows are netted against each other, with the difference being
               paid by one party to the other. The Fund will segregate cash or
               liquid securities having a value at least equal to the Fund's net
               payment obligations under any swap transaction, marked to market
               daily.

               Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to
               comply with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the
               failure of a counter party is generally limited to the net
               interest payment to be received by the Fund, and/or the
               termination value at the end of the contract. Additionally, risks
               may arise from movements in interest rates unanticipated by
               Management.

               Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on
               the swaps are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized
               gains/losses, along with the fair value of the future periodic
               payment streams on the swaps.

               The unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim
               net interest payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses
               in conjunction with the actual net receipt or payment of such
               amounts. At April 30, 2004, the Fund had outstanding interest
               rate swap contracts as follows:

               (1) 30 day LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)

          9    SECURITY LENDING: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the
               Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund entered into a
               Securities Lending Agreement ("Agreement") with Neuberger.
               Securities loans involve certain risks in the event a borrower
               should fail financially, including delays or inability to recover
               the lent securities or foreclose against the collateral. The
               investment manager, under the general supervision of the Fund's
               Board of Directors, monitors the creditworthiness of the parties
               to whom the Fund makes security loans. The Fund will not lend
               securities on which covered call options have been written, or
               lend securities on terms which would prevent the Fund from
               qualifying as a regulated investment company. The Fund receives
               cash collateral equal to at least 102% of the current market
               value of the loaned securities. The Fund invests the cash
               collateral in the N&B Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC, which
               is managed by State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State
               Street") pursuant to guidelines approved by the Fund's investment
               manager. Neuberger guarantees a minimum revenue to the Fund under
               the Agreement, and receives a portion of any revenue earned in
               excess of the guaranteed amount as a lending agency fee. At April
               30, 2004, the Fund had not paid Neuberger any fees under the
               Agreement.

               Income earned on the securities loaned, if any, is reflected in
               the Statement of Operations under the caption Income from
               securities loaned-net.

          10   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN
               MANAGEMENT INC.: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the
               Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund may invest in the
               Neuberger Berman Institutional Cash Fund (the "Cash Fund"), a
               fund managed by Management and having the same Board members as
               the Fund. The Cash Fund seeks to provide as high a level of
               current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital
               and the maintenance of liquidity. For any cash that the Fund
               invests in the Cash Fund, Management waives a portion of its
               management fee equal to the management fee it receives from the
               Cash Fund on those assets. For the six months ended April 30,
               2004, such waived fees amounted to $22,489. For the six months
               ended April 30, 2004, income earned on this investment amounted
               to $178,100 and is reflected in the Statement of Operations under
               the caption Income from investments in affiliated issuers.

          11   ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed
               to pay all organizational expenses and the amount by which the
               Fund's offering costs for common stock (other than sales load)
               exceed $0.03 per share. The costs incurred by Management were
               $18,928. Offering costs for common stock paid by the Fund were
               charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the
               completion of the Fund's offerings and amounted to $998,218.

               Additionally, estimated offering costs of $345,000 and a sales
               load of $2,450,000 incurred through the issuance of AMPS were
               charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the
               completion of the Fund's AMPS offering.

               As of April 30, 2004, total offering costs of $306,184 remain
               payable by the Fund.

          12   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
               investments will be concentrated in income-producing common
               equity securities, preferred securities, convertible securities
               and non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving
               the majority of their revenue from the ownership, construction,
               financing, management and/or sale of commercial, industrial,
               and/or residential real estate. Values of the securities of such
               companies may fluctuate more due to economic, legal, cultural,
               geopolitical or technological developments affecting the United
               States real estate industry, or a segment of the real estate
               industry in which the Fund owns a substantial position, than
               would the shares of a fund not concentrated in the real estate
               industry.

               NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER
               TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES:

               The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a
               Management Agreement. For such investment management services,
               the Fund pays Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its
               average daily Managed Assets. Managed Assets equal the total
               assets of the Fund, less liabilities other than the aggregate
               indebtedness entered into for purposes of leverage. For purposes
               of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value of any AMPS
               outstanding is not considered a liability.

               Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the
               management fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the
               following annual rates:

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

               For the six months ended April 30, 2004, such waived fees
               amounted to $760,311.

               The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an
               Administration Agreement. The Fund pays Management an
               administration fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average
               daily Managed Assets under this agreement. Additionally,
               Management retains State Street as its sub-administrator under a
               Sub-Administration Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee
               for all services received under the agreement.

               On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger, a member firm of
               the New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to the Fund, became
               indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings
               Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned holding company ("the
               Transaction"). Upon completion of the Transaction, the Fund's
               management and sub-advisory agreements automatically terminated.
               To provide for continuity of management, the Fund's Board of
               Directors, which was aware of the impending Transaction when the
               Fund was established, and the initial sole shareholder of the
               Fund voted to approve new management and sub-advisory agreements,
               which took effect upon closing of the Transaction. Neuberger is
               retained by Management to furnish it with investment
               recommendations and research information without added cost to
               the Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors
               of the Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

               The Fund entered into a commission recapture program, which
               enables it to pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a
               portion of the commissions it pays to a broker that is not a
               related party of the Fund. Expenses paid through this program may
               include costs of custodial, transfer agency or accounting
               services. For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the impact of
               this arrangement was a reduction of $62,504.

               The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
               custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in
               the Statement of Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was
               a reduction of $1,363.

               In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund
               pays, through the auction agent, a service fee to each
               participating broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation
               preference of the AMPS held by the broker-dealer's customers. For
               any auction preceding a rate period of less than one year, the
               service fee is paid at the annual rate of 1/4 of 1%; for any
               auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the service
               fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the
               broker-dealer.

               In order to satisfy ratings agency requirements, the Fund is
               required to provide each rating agency a report on a monthly
               basis verifying that the Fund is maintaining eligible assets
               having a discounted value equal to or greater than the Preferred
               Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum level set by
               each rating agency as one of the conditions to maintain the AAA
               rating on the AMPS. 'Discounted Value' refers to the fact that
               the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
               calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face
               value, at a rate depending on their rating. The Fund pays a fee
               to State Street, as Fund sub-administrator, for the preparation
               of this report.

+   Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
    changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each fiscal
    period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the purchase of
    common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of common
    shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
    Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
    obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent past
    performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may be
    lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Total return would have
    been lower if Management had not waived a portion of the investment
    management fee. Performance data current to the most recent month-end are
    available at www.nb.com.

#   The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
    consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset arrangements.

    not undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to average

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                       21

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
