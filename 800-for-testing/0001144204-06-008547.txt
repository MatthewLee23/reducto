The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
consist of Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the Dominican
Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and Venezuela. The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in a broad
range of securities of issuers, including U.S.-based companies which engage in
substantial trade with, and derive substantial revenue from, operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

Chairman and President


February 7, 2006

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

I am pleased to report to you that our Fund continues to do well on all fronts:
net asset value performance, price performance and shareholder value.

As of December 31, 2005, the end of the first half of our fiscal year, our
Fund's net asset value stood at $7.83 per share, a gain of 9.21% (adjusted for a
year-end distribution of $0.1748 per share; not annualized, unaudited). Over the
12 month period ended Dec- ember 31, 2005, the net asset value increased 14.52%.
We are now up over 100% from inception (adjusted for distributions). The Fund's
share price, over the 6 and 12 month periods, gained 28.87% (not annualized) and
32.33%, respectively, adjusted for the distribution.

Since calendar year-end, the Fund's net asset value has continued to climb,
reaching a record high of $8.39 on February 1st. Eleven companies of our
portfolio have made the new high list so far this year: Bancolombia, S.A.;
Cemex, ADR; Consolidated Water Co.; Florida East Coast Industries; Grupo
Televisa S.A.; Grupo TMM, S.A. ADR; Latin America Equity Fund; Mastec, Inc.;
Mexico Fund; Telefonos de Mexico ADR; and Watsco Incorporated. Two stocks which
had been disappointments have come back nicely; these include Grupo TMM, which
is currently changing hands at $4.72, up 52% from a year ago, and CancerVax,
which is trading above $3 today, up from $1.31 last October.

Herzfeld Caribbean's discount to net asset value is currently 6.5%, four
percentage points narrower than it was a year ago. At the beginning of January,
our shares traded at a slight premium. This is the 12th year of the Fund's
existence, and in each year, it has attained a premium to net asset value. In
December, when the share price made a record high at $8.85 per share, we were
trading at over a 10% premium to net asset value.

Portfolio Commentary

We have made some significant changes in our portfolio since December 31st. We
took some rather large profits in three of our closed-end fund holdings: Latin
American Equity Fund, Latin America Discovery Fund and Mexico Fund. For seasonal
reasons, January is usually a good time of the year to sell closed-end funds.
Historically, in December closed-end funds become undervalued due to year-end
tax selling and in January they tend to snap back, just like a stretched
rubberband which has been released. For instance, our gain in Latin American
Discovery Fund was $158,000; in addition, from that holding we received a large
year-end distribution of $5.7595 per share, or $77,920. The January sales have
boosted our cash position from zero at year-end to approximately 6%. For the
time being I prefer to keep this somewhat reduced investment level.

There are two new companies in our portfolio: the first is Copa Holdings, S.A.
and the second is Cuban Electric Company.

Copa Holdings, based in Panama, is a leading Latin American airline providing
passenger and cargo service to twenty countries, primarily in Central America,
South America and the Caribbean, including daily flights to Havana.

We have been expanding our research into companies that have had property
confiscated by the Castro government; it is a very long list. About 9000 claims
have been filed, of which just under 6000 have been certified by the Foreign
Claims Settlement Commission of the United States for a total value of $1.8
billion, and with accumulated interest for 46 years the total approaches $20
billion! These certified claims are by U.S. companies and citizens and do not
include another $20 billion in Cuban exile claims. Cuban Electric, a U.S.
company, is our first investment which targets this area. As of June 30, 2005,
Cuban Electric had approximately $18 million in assets (outside of Cuba) in cash
and equivalents, and with 3.6 million shares outstanding, that represents about
$5 per share. We have been buying stock in the $8 per share range. The company
filed a claim under the Cuban Claims Act which has been certified; the claim
amounts to over $267 million, about $74 per share (not including interest). Of
course, whether or not any Cuban prior claims or the defaulted Republic of Cuba
debt* will ever be paid, even in part, is impossible to predict. I do believe,
however, that before the U.S.

currently valuing at zero.

government would consider lifting the embargo, the subject of prior claims will
have to be addressed. These investments are in keeping with our investment
strategy of trying to position a significant part of the Fund's portfolio in
companies that would benefit from any resumption of trade with Cuba.

================================================================================

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January, 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment policy is to invest at least 80% of its assets in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries. The Fund's
investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund
pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental and may not be changed without the approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At December 31, 2005, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands, representing approximately 13.48%
and 8.59% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is Investors Bank & Trust Company, based
in Boston, Massachusetts.

Security Valuation

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ National Market or Capital Market) are stated at the last reported
sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price);
other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid price.
Restricted securities and other securities for which quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Income Recognition

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is recognized on an
accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized
over the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include
the portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments
denominated in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains
and losses on investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, a
distribution from long-term capital gains of $0.1748 per share was declared on
November 16, 2005, payable on January 13, 2006 to shareholders of record
December 31, 2005.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of
Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A "regulatory halt" on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July, 1995. As of December
31, 2005, the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which
approximates the bonds' fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the six
months ended December 31, 2005 amounted to $93,430, of which $47,232 was payable
as of December 31, 2005.

During the six months ended December 31, 2005, the Fund paid $3,968 of brokerage
commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the six months ended December 31, 2005, purchases and sales of investment
securities were $1,475,080 and $1,652,020, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, the Fund's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains
of $6,107,676 and gross unrealized losses of $474,007, resulting in a net
unrealized gain of $5,633,669 for financial statement purposes.

NOTE 5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The cost of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower than the
cost basis for income tax purposes by approximately $19,280 due to wash sale
adjustments.

The income tax basis of distributive earnings as of December 31, 2005, include
$1,425,429 of accumulated net investment loss, $562,905 of accumulated net
realized gain on investments and $5,633,669 of net unrealized gain on
investments.

For the six months ended December 31, 2005, the Fund had net realized gains of
$427,184.

NOTE 6: RESIGNATION OF AUDITOR

Kaufman, Rossin & Co., P.A. ("KRC"), the independent auditors and independent
registered public accounting firm to Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Registrant") informed the Registrant in a letter dated February 7, 2006 that it
has resigned as independent auditors and independent registered public
accounting firm to the Registrant.

KRC's reports on the Registrant's financial statements for the two most recent
fiscal years contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor were they
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the Registrant's two most recent fiscal years and through February 7,
2006: (i) there were no disagreements with KRC on any matter of accounting
principles, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KRC, would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with
its reports on the Registrant's financial statements for such years; and (ii)
there were no "reportable events" of the kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Discussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment
Advisory Agreement
================================================================================

The Fund's Board of Directors including a majority of those directors who are
not "interested persons" as such term is defined in the 1940 Act ("Independent
Directors") unanimously approved the continuance of the investment advisory
agreement between the Fund and the Advisor (the "Agreement") at a meeting held
on August 17, 2005.

Before meeting to determine whether to approve the Agreement, the Board had the
opportunity to review written materials provided by the Advisor and by legal
counsel to the Fund which contained information to help the Board evaluate the
Agreement. The materials included (i) a memorandum from the Fund's legal counsel
regarding the Directors' responsibilities in evaluating and approving the
Agreement, (ii) a letter from the Advisor containing detailed information about
the Advisor's services to the Fund, Fund performance, allocation of Fund
transactions, compliance and administration information, and the compensation
received by the Advisor from the Fund; (iii) a copy of the current investment
advisory agreement between the Fund and the Advisor; (iv) audited financial
statements for the Advisor for the year-ended December 31, 2004 and unaudited
financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2005; (v) the Advisor's
Form ADV Parts I and II; (v) comparative performance data for the Fund relative
to peer funds (small closed-end funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin
American region); and (vi) comparative statistics and fee data for the Fund
relative to peer funds.

During its deliberations on whether to approve the continuance of the Agreement,
the Board considered many factors. The Board considered the nature, extent and
quality of the services to be provided by the Advisor and determined that such
services will meet the needs of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board
reviewed the services provided to the Fund by the Advisor as compared to
services provided by other advisors, which manage investment companies with
investment objectives, strategies and policies similar to those of the Fund. The
Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by
the Advisor were appropriate and consistent with the terms of the advisory
agreement, that the quality of those services had been consistent with industry
norms and that the Fund was likely to benefit from the continued provision of
those services. The Board also concluded that the Advisor had sufficient
personnel, with the appropriate education and experience, to serve the Fund
effectively and had demonstrated its continuing ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel

Both at the meeting and on an ongoing basis throughout the year, the Board
considered and evaluated the investment performance of the Fund and reviewed the
Fund's performance relative to other investment companies and funds with similar
investment objectives, strategies and policies, and its respective benchmark
index. The Board considered both the short-term and long-term performance of the
Fund. They concluded that the performance of the Fund was within an acceptable
range of performance relative to other funds with similar investment objectives,
strategies and policies.

Discussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment
Advisory Agreement (continued)
================================================================================

The Board considered the costs of the services provided by the Advisor, the
compensation and benefits received by the Advisor providing services to the
Fund, as well as the Advisor's profitability. In addition, the Board considered
any direct or indirect revenues received by affiliates of the Advisor including
the commissions paid to the Fund's affiliated broker/dealer, Thomas J. Herzfeld
& Co., Inc. The Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by the
Fund and relevant comparable fee data and statistics of a sampling of small
closed-end funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin American region. The
Board further discussed the services by the Advisor and concluded that the
advisory services performed were efficient and satisfactory and that the fee
charged was reasonable and not excessive. The Board concluded that the Advisor's
fees and profits derived from its relationship with the Fund in light of its
expenses, were reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services
provided, taking into account the fees charged by other advisors for managing
comparable funds with similar strategies. The Directors also concluded that the
overall expense ratio of the Fund was reasonable, taking into account the size
of the Fund, the quality of services provided by the Advisor, and the investment
performance of the Fund.

The Board also considered the extent to which economies of scale would be
realized relative to fee levels as the Fund grows, and whether the advisory fee
levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of shareholders. The
Board recognized that because of the closed-end structure of the Fund, and the
fact that there is no influx of capital, this particular factor is less relevant
to the Fund than it would be to an open-end fund. The Board concluded that only
marginal economies of scale could be achieved through the growth of assets since
the Fund is closed-ended.

The Board also considered its deliberations regarding the Advisor's services and
performance from the regular Board meetings held throughout the year, including
the Board's discussion of the Fund's investment objective, long-term
performance, investment style and process. The Board noted the high level of
diligence with which it reviews and evaluates the Advisor throughout the year
and the extensive information provided with respect to Advisor's performance and
the Fund's expenses on a quarterly basis. The Board also considered whether
there have occurred any events that would constitute a reason not to renew the
Agreement and concluded there were not.

After deliberation and further consideration of the factors discussed above and
information presented at the August 17, 2005 meeting and at previous meetings of
the Board, the Board and the Independent Directors determined to continue the
Agreement for an additional one-year period. In arriving at this decision, the
Board and the Independent Directors did not identify any single matter as
controlling, but made their determination in light of all the circumstances. The
Board and the Independent Directors did not consider any one of the factors and
considerations identified above to be determinative. The Board based its
decision to approve the Agreement on all the relevant factors in light of its
reasonable business judgment, and with a view to future long-term
considerations.

                                   APPENDIX A

                     THE HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.

                       Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures

      The Board of Directors of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") hereby adopts the following policy and procedures with respect to voting
proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund:

Policy

      It is the policy of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") to
delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities
held by the Fund to the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") as a part of
the Adviser's general management of the Fund, subject to the Board's continuing
oversight.' The voting of proxies is an integral part of the investment
management services that the Adviser provides pursuant to the advisory contract.

      The Adviser may, but is not required to, delegate the responsibility for
voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund to a
sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser") retained to provide investment advisory services, if
applicable. If such responsibility is delegated to a Sub-Adviser, then the
Sub-Adviser shall assume the fiduciary duty and reporting responsibilities of
the Adviser under these policy guidelines.
<PAGE>

Fiduciary Duty

      The right to vote a proxy with respect to portfolio securities held by the
Fund is an asset of the Fund. The Adviser, to which authority to vote on behalf
of the Fund is delegated, acts as a fiduciary of the Fund and must vote proxies
in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Procedures

      The following are the procedures adopted by the Board for the
administration of this policy:

      A. Review of Adviser Proxy Voting Procedures. The Adviser with authority
to vote proxies on behalf of the Fund shall present to the Board its policies,
procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies at least annually, and must
notify the Board promptly of material changes to any of these documents.

      B. Voting Record Reporting. No less than annually, the Adviser shall
report to the Board a record of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio
securities of the Fund during the year. With respect to those proxies that the
Adviser has identified as involving a conflict of interest(2), the Adviser shall
submit a separate report indicating the nature of the conflict of interest and
how that conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy.

Revocation

      The delegation by the Board of the authority to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Fund is entirely voluntary and may be revoked by the
Board, in whole or in part, at any time.

Annual Filing

      The Fund shall file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
its portfolio securities during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX not later than August 31 of each year.

Disclosures

      The Fund shall include in its annual report to stockholders:

      A description of this policy and of the policies and procedures used by
the Adviser to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities
(3); and

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website(4).

      The Fund shall also include in its annual and semi-annual reports to
stockholders:

      A statement disclosing that a description of the policies and procedures
used by or on behalf of the Fund to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Funds is available without charge, upon request, by
calling the Fund's toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(5)

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(6)
<PAGE>

Review of Policy.

      At least annually, the Board shall review this Policy to determine its
sufficiency and shall make and approve any changes that it deems necessary from
time to time

- ----------
(1)   This policy is adopted for the purpose of the disclosure requirements
      adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Release Nos. 33-8188,
      34-47304, IC-25922.

(2)   As it is used in this document, the term "conflict of interest" refers to
      a situation in which the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or affiliated persons of
      the Adviser or Sub-Adviser have a financial interest in a matter presented
      by a proxy other than the obligation it incurs as investment adviser to
      the Fund which compromises the Adviser's or Sub-Adviser's independence of
      judgment and action with respect to the voting of the proxy.

(3)   This disclosure shall be included in the annual report next filed by the
      Fund, on Form N-CSR on or after July 1, 2003.

                                  PROXY VOTING

                             POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I.    POLICY

Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. (the "Adviser") acts as discretionary
investment adviser for various clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and clients governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").

Selected clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. have elected
to have the Adviser vote proxies or act on the other shareholder actions on
their behalf, while other clients vote proxies themselves.

When voting proxies or acting on corporate actions for clients, the Adviser's
utmost concern is that all decisions be made in the best interest of its clients
(for ERISA accounts, plan beneficiaries and participants, in accordance with the
letter and spirit of ERISA). The Adviser will act in a manner deemed prudent and
diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the assets of
its clients' accounts.

II.   PURPOSE

The purpose of these Policies and Procedures is to memorialize the procedures
and policies adopted by the Adviser to enable it to comply with its
responsibilities and the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"). These Policies and Procedures
also reflect the fiduciary standards and responsibilities set forth by the
Department of Labor for ERISA accounts.

III.  PROCEDURES

Cecilia Gondor, Executive Vice President of the Adviser, is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that all proxies received by the Adviser are voted in a
timely manner and voted consistently across all portfolios. Although many proxy
proposals can be voted in accordance with the Adviser's established guidelines
(see Section V. below) (the "Guidelines"), the Adviser recognizes that some
proposals require special consideration, which may dictate that the Adviser
makes an exception to the Guidelines.
<PAGE>

Cecilia Gondor is also responsible for ensuring that all corporate actions
received by the Adviser are addressed in a timely manner and consistent action
is taken across all portfolios.

      A. Conflicts of Interest. Where a proxy proposal raises a material
conflict of interest between the Adviser's interests and that of one or more its
clients, the Adviser shall resolve such conflict in the manner described below.

            1. Vote in Accordance with the Guidelines. To the extent that the
Adviser has little or no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect
to the proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such
pre-determined voting policy.

            2. Obtain Consent of Clients. To the extent that the Adviser has
discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the proposal in
question, the Adviser shall disclose the conflict to the relevant clients and
obtain their consent to the proposed vote prior to voting the securities. The
disclosure to the clients will include sufficient detail regarding the matter to
be voted on and the nature of our conflict that the clients would be able to
make an informed decision regarding the vote. When a client does not respond to
such a conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser will
abstain from voting the securities held by that client's account.

      B. Limitations. In certain circumstances, in accordance with a client's
investment advisory contract (or other written directive) or where the Adviser
has determined that it is in the client's best interest, the Adviser will not
vote proxies received. The following are some circumstances where the Adviser
will limit its role in voting proxies received on client securities:

            1. Client Maintains Proxy Voting Authority: Where a client has not
specifically delegated the authority to vote proxies to the Adviser or that it
has delegated the right to vote proxies to a third party, the Adviser will not
vote the securities and will direct the relevant custodian to send the proxy
material directly to the client. If any proxy material is received by the
Adviser, it will promptly be forwarded to the client.

            2. Terminated Account: Once a client account has been terminated
with the Adviser in accordance with its investment advisory agreement, the
Adviser will not vote any proxies received after the termination. However, the
client may specify in writing that proxies should be directed to the client for
action.

            3. Limited Value: If the Adviser concludes that the client's
economic interest or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or
insignificant, the Adviser will abstain from voting a client's proxies. The
Adviser does not vote proxies received for securities which are no longer held
by the client's account. In addition, the Adviser generally does not vote
securities where the economic value of the securities in the client's account is
less than $500.

            4. Securities Lending Programs: When securities are out on loan,
they are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in
its discretion. However, where the Adviser determines that a proxy vote (or
shareholder action) is materially important to the client's account, the Adviser
may recall the security.

            5. Unjustifiable Costs: In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, the Adviser may abstain from voting where the cost of
voting a client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits of the proxy
proposal.

IV.   RECORD KEEPING

In accordance with Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, the Adviser will maintain
for the time periods set forth in the Rule (i) these proxy voting procedures and
policies, and amendments thereto; (ii) all proxy statements received regarding
client securities (provided however, that the Adviser may rely on the proxy
statement filed on EDGAR as its records)(1); (iii) a record of votes cast on
behalf of clients; (iv) records of client requests for proxy voting information;
(v) any documents prepared by the adviser that were material to making a
decision how to vote or that memorialized the basis for the decision; and (vi)
records relating to requests made to clients regarding conflicts of interest in
voting the proxy.
<PAGE>

The Adviser will describe in its Part II of Form ADV (or other brochure
fulfilling the requirement of Rule 204-3) its proxy voting policies and
procedures and advising clients how they may obtain information on how the
Adviser voted their securities. Clients may obtain information on how their
securities were voted or a copy of our Policies and Procedures by written
request addressed to the Adviser.

V.    GUIDELINES

Each proxy issue will be considered individually. The following guidelines are a
partial list to be used in voting proposals contained in the proxy statements,
but will not be used as rigid rules.

(1)        Issues regarding the issuer's Board entrenchment and anti-takeover measures such as the following:     Oppose

           b.  Proposals to limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings;

           c.  Proposals to require super majority votes;

           d.  Proposals requesting excessive increases in authorized common or preferred shares where
               management provides no explanation for the use or need for these additional shares;

           e.  Proposals regarding "poison pill" provisions; and

           f.  Permitting "green mail".
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)        Providing cumulative voting rights.                                                                    Oppose
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)        "Social issues," unless specific client guidelines supersede, e.g., restrictions regarding South       Oppose
           Africa.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)        Election of directors recommended by management, except if there is a proxy fight.                     Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)        Election of auditors recommended by management, unless seeking to replace if there exists a            Approve
           dispute over policies.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5)        Date and place of annual meeting.                                                                      Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6)        Limitation on charitable contributions or fees paid to lawyers.                                        Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7)        Ratification of directors' actions on routine matters since previous annual meeting.                   Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8)        Confidential voting                                                                                    Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

- ----------
      (1) Because the Adviser primarily invests its clients' assets in
securities of foreign issuers, the Adviser generally has not been receiving
proxy statements from such issuers because the laws of the countries in which
these issuers are domiciled respecting delivery of proxy statements to
shareholders are different than those of the U.S.
<PAGE>

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                                                            <C>
Confidential voting is most often proposed by shareholders as a means of eliminating undue management
pressure on shareholders regarding their vote on proxy issues.

The Adviser will generally approve these proposals as shareholders can later divulge their votes to
management on a selective basis if a legitimate reason arises.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9)        Limiting directors' liability                                                                           Approve
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(10)       Eliminate preemptive right                                                                              Approve

Preemptive rights give current shareholders the opportunity to maintain their current percentage ownership
through any subsequent equity offerings. These provisions are no longer common in the U.S., and can restrict
management's ability to raise new capital.

The Adviser approves the elimination of preemptive rights, but will oppose the elimination of limited
preemptive rights, e.g., on proposed issues representing more than an acceptable level of total dilution.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(11)       Employee Stock Purchase Plan                                                                            Approve
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(12)       Establish 401(k) Plan                                                                                   Approve
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(13)       Rotate annual meeting location/date                                                                     Approve
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(14)       Establish a staggered Board                                                                             Approve
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(15)       Eliminate director mandatory retirement policy                                                       Case-by-Case
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(16)       Option and stock grants to management and directors                                                  Case-by-Case
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
