Item 1. Report to Shareholders

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this update, you'll learn about how your trust performed during the
       reporting period. The portfolio management team will provide an overview
       of the market climate, and discuss some of the factors that helped or
       hindered performance during the reporting period. In addition, this
       report includes the trust's financial statements and a list of
       investments, as well as other information.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. The trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and,
       therefore, the value of the trust shares may be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return, common
share market price and net asset value will fluctuate and trust shares, when
sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor. Total return assumes an investment at the
common share market price at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all
distributions for the period in accordance with the trust's dividend
reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing common share market
price at the end of the period. Distribution rate represents the monthly
annualized distributions of the trust at the end of the period and not the
earnings of the trust.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2003

       Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the Adviser's High Yield
       team. Current members include Gordon Loery, Executive Director; Josh
       Givelber, Vice President and Chad Liu, Vice President.(1) The following
       discussion reflects their views on the trust's performance.

Q.     BEFORE YOU DISCUSS HOW THE TRUST PERFORMED, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE
       OVERALL MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

A.     The high-yield market roared ahead in the first half of 2003, posting its
       best six-month return since 1991. High-yield mutual fund inflows during
       the period were at their highest level ever, reflecting enormous demand
       on the part of individual and institutional investors. The market was
       also boosted by declining default rates and better earnings results from
       many companies.

       Overall, performance was inversely related to credit rating, with some
       CCC credits strongly outperforming B and BB rated bonds. Sector
       performance was dominated by industries such as wireless communications,
       utilities, telecommunications and cable that were among the worst
       performers in 2002.

Q.     HOW DID THE TRUST PERFORM DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.     The trust outperformed its benchmark.

        --  The trust returned 26.16 percent for the six months ended June 30,
            2003, based on common share market price.

        --  By comparison, the trust's benchmark, the Chase High Yield Index,
            returned 16.75 percent.

        --  The trust's monthly dividend of $0.037 translated to a distribution
            rate of 9.08 percent, based on the trust's common share market price
            as of June 30, 2003.

       See Performance Summary for additional information and index definition.

Q.     WHAT HELPED PERFORMANCE DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.      --  Strong security selection in the wireless sector helped the trust's
            performance. American Cellular performed especially well, rebounding
            strongly from a low valuation on the basis of its solid
            fundamentals.

        --  Housing companies such as CB Richard Ellis and Technical Olympic
            performed well as housing activity remained one of the economy's few
            bright spots.

        --  Our analysts found few compelling opportunities in the consumer-
            products sector, which led us to underweight the group relative to
            the benchmark. The sector's subsequent underperformance relative to
            the rest of the market supported their views.

Q.     WHAT FACTORS HINDERED PERFORMANCE?

A.      --  The portfolio's relatively high aggregate credit quality did not
            allow it to capitalize on the strong performance of some of the
            lowest-rated credits.

        --  The lack of compelling opportunities in the airline and utilities
            sectors led us to underweight those sectors, both of which enjoyed
            rallies coming off of their 2002 lows.

Q.     PLEASE WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU POSITIONED THE PORTFOLIO, HIGHLIGHTING
       KEY THEMES.

A.      --  Strong performance in the energy sector led us to take some profits
            there, though we maintained the portfolio's overweight position.

        --  Many of the transportation holdings are automobile
            parts-manufacturers; we reduced the portfolio's holdings in the
            sector because of concerns about the health of these companies going
            forward.

        --  We increased the portfolio's holdings of utilities to keep it in
            line with that sector's rapidly growing weighting in the benchmark.

        --  Through selective purchases, we added to the portfolio's cable
            holdings when our analysts were able to identify attractive
            companies.

Q.     NOW THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRUST, DO YOU HAVE ANY
       CLOSING THOUGHTS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS?

A.     After the strong rally of the past six months, we believe future gains in
       the high-yield market are more likely to come from yield than from price
       improvements. If this proves to be the case, security selection will
       assume increasing importance as a driver of total returns. We hope to see
       ongoing improvement in the economy, which should be supportive of the
       high-yield market, and will continue monitoring the market for
       opportunities to capture value.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

June 30, 2003 (Unaudited)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

June 30, 2003 (Unaudited)

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2002, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $22,397,747 which expires between December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2010. Of this amount, $2,448,303 will expire on December
31, 2003.

    At June 30, 2003, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets of the Trust.

    For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $2,500 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended June
30, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $13,900 representing
Van Kampen Investment Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost
of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are reported as
part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the Statement of
Operations.

                                                                              19

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

June 30, 2003 (Unaudited)

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments were $25,169,825 and $26,417,571, respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

    As of June 30, 2003, the Trust has outstanding 1,112 Auction Preferred
Shares ("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is currently
reset every 28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on June 30,
2003 was 1.150%. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the rates ranged
from 1.140% to 1.600%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of Preferred Share Maintenance
expense.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              21
<PAGE>

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing State Street Bank
and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

                                2800 Post Oak Blvd.
