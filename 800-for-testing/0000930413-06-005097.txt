ITEM 1. REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS: (unaudited)

     At May 31, 2006 the  Company's  net asset value was $70.16 per share.  This
compares  with $55.93 per share at November 30, 2005,  the end of the  Company's
previous fiscal year. The Company's most recent net asset value on June 16, 2006
was $63.09 per share.  On this date,  the closing market price of our shares was
$55.90 per share, a discount of 11.4% to the net asset value.

     Net  investment  income for the six months  ended May 31, 2006 was $.31 per
share vs. $.08 for the same period last year. The Board of Directors  declared a
semi-annual  dividend of $.20 per share on May 19, 2006  payable June 2, 2006 to
shareholders of record on May 26, 2006.

     At our annual meeting held on March 8, 2006 shareholders  reelected the ten
incumbent directors, ratified the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the
Company's  auditors for the fiscal year ending  November 30, 2006 and defeated a
shareholder proposal  recommending action with regard to the discount.  See page
15 of this report for details regarding the results of the voting.

     In early May, the U.S. dollar gold price began a sharp correction  bringing
its price down by mid June  approximately 19%. This decline was probably overdue
following  the gold price spike from $500 to over $700 earlier in the year.  The
Company's stock price,  impacted by this decline,  fell from a high of $73.15 on
May 9, 2006 to a low of $52.59 on June 14, 2006, a decline of approximately 28%.

     The fall in the gold price  denominated in South African rand was much more
subdued -  declining  only about 13%.  The recent  weakening  of the rand should
improve profit margins in the South African gold mines.

     Investors  appear to have  become  nervous  and  anxious to  bolster  their
liquidity in the face of statements by U.S.  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Bernanke
and other  international  spokesmen  expressing  concern over  inflation and the
higher  interest rates this implies.  The prospect of rising  interest rates has
helped to reverse the recent fall of the dollar.  A strong  dollar is  generally
not  helpful to the  dollar  gold  price.  In  addition,  the fall in the Middle
Eastern,  Asian and European stock markets seems to have resulted in a flight to
the  relative  security  of  the  U.S.  dollar,  adding  to its  strength  while
negatively impacting the gold price.

     Randgold Resources Limited was added to our portfolio in February and April
of this year.  This company was originally the  exploration  arm of Randgold and
Exploration  Company Limited. It was incorporated in the Channel Islands in 1995
and is now totally independent of its former parent company.  Randgold describes
itself as an African gold mining and exploration  business.  Gold discoveries to
date include  deposits in Southern  Mali,  Northern Mali and in the Ivory Coast.
These deposits total approximately 17 million ounces. Randgold's gold production
was up 54% in 2005 at a total cash cost of $211 per ounce.  The company has been
profitable  for the past five years and  earned a net  profit of $41  million in
2005.  Additional   exploration  is  being  undertaken  in  Senegal,   Tanzania,
Burkina-Fasco  and Ghana.  This  investment  provides  us with a position in the
rapidly developing gold prospects in Central Africa.

     Anglo  American  plc is the  only  company  in our  portfolio  whose  major
activity is not in the mining of precious  metals.  Over the past several  years
this company has been pursuing a strategy  designed to simplify its  complicated
shareholder structure. It has disposed of a number of smaller business interests
and has announced its intention to focus more on the mining of industrial metals
and coal while  continuing to dispose of additional  companies,  particularly in
the paper and packaging  business and in steel and vanadium  production.  It has
also announced its intention to reduce and eventually eliminate its 41% stake in
AngloGold  Ashanti  Limited,  thus,  removing  itself totally from the mining of
gold.  Finally,  it has announced  its  intention to continue  buying in its own
shares.

                                                                               1
<PAGE>

     The  prospect  of  further  reduction  by Anglo  American  of its  stake in
AngloGold Ashanti has placed a damper on AngloGold  Ashanti's stock price and it
has  underperformed  both  Harmony Gold Mining  Company  Limited and Gold Fields
Limited.

     Platinum also spiked higher during the year and in spite of a correction in
the past month is still up 18% in dollars.  Like gold,  it appears to still have
an intact  medium and  long-term  rising  trend.  Demand for the platinum  group
metals has been boosted by ongoing environmental  concerns. The current high oil
price, increased global warming concerns and soot emissions should stimulate the
demand for catalytic converters. Jewelry demand for platinum remains firm.

     Impala Platinum  Holdings Limited has been negotiating the participation of
the  Zimbabwean   government  in  the  company's  platinum   properties.   These
negotiations now appear to be resolved. Zimplats, its Zimbabwean subsidiary, has
agreed to release 36% of its  resources  to the  government  in return for Black
Empowerment  Credits and cash.  This agreement will allow Impala to proceed with
the development of its sizable platinum resources in Zimbabwe.

     In  February  2006,  after 48 years,  the Company  closed the  Johannesburg
office of its predecessor, ASA Limited. At the same time Mr. Ronald L. McCarthy,
who had served for 17 years as Managing  Director of ASA  Limited,  retired.  He
will remain on our Board and will be available  to provide us with  guidance and
advice as we evolve from a company  primarily  invested in gold mining companies
in South  Africa into a company  investing in gold and other  precious  minerals
companies worldwide.

value may be requested  from LGN Group,  LLC,  P.O. Box 269,  Florham  Park,  NJ

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                          SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2006
                                   (UNAUDITED)

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company")
is a closed-end management investment company registered under the United States
Investment  Company  Act of  1940,  and was  organized  as an  exempted  limited
liability  company under the laws of Bermuda.  The following is a summary of the
Company's  significant  accounting policies:

A. INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  listed on U.S. and foreign stock  exchanges are generally
valued at the last  reported  sales price on the last trading day of the period,
or the mean  between the closing bid and asked  prices of those  securities  not
traded on that date.  In the event that a mean price  cannot be computed  due to
the absence of either a bid or an asked price, then the bid price plus 1% or the
asked price less 1%, as applicable,  is used. Securities listed on foreign stock
exchanges  may be fair valued  based on  significant  events that have  occurred
subsequent the close of the foreign markets.

Securities  for which current market  quotations  are not readily  available are
valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by, or in accordance with
procedures adopted by, the Company's Board of Directors. If a security is valued
at a "fair  value",  that value is likely to be  different  from the last quoted
price for the security.  Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a good
faith  determination of a security's fair value. These factors include,  but are
not  limited  to, the nature of the  security;  relevant  financial  or business
developments  of the  issuer;  actively  traded  similar or related  securities;
conversion  rights on the security;  and changes in overall  market  conditions.

Where the Company holds  securities  listed on foreign stock  exchanges and ADRs
representing  these  securities  are  actively  traded  on the  New  York  Stock
Exchange,  the securities are fair valued based on the last reported sales price
of the ADRs.

The  difference  between cost and current  value is reflected  separately as net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.  The net realized gain or
loss from the sale of securities is determined  for  accounting  purposes on the
identified  cost basis.

There is no assurance that the valuation at which the Company's  investments are
carried could be realized upon sale.

B. CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company  considers  all money market and all highly  liquid  temporary  cash
investments  purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be
cash equivalents.

C. FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION

Portfolio  securities  and other assets and  liabilities  denominated in foreign
currencies  are  translated  into U.S.  dollar  amounts at the  closing  rate of
exchange on the date of valuation.  Purchases and sales of investment securities
and income and expense items  denominated  in foreign  currencies are translated
into U.S.  dollar  amounts on the  respective  dates of such  transactions.  The
resulting  net foreign  currency  gain or loss is included in the  statement  of
operations.

D. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

During  the six  months  ended May 31,  2006  sales of  securities  amounted  to
$33,773,417 and purchases of securities amounted to $24,677,970.

Dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date  (date  on  which  the
securities would be sold ex-dividend) net of withholding taxes, if any. Interest
income is recognized  on the accrual  basis.

E.  DISTRIBUTION  TO  SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.



                                                                               7
<PAGE>

The reporting for financial  statement purposes of distributions made during the
fiscal year from net  investment  income or net  realized  gains may differ from
their  ultimate  reporting for United States  federal  income tax purposes.  The
differences  are  caused  primarily  by the  separate  line item  reporting  for
financial  statement  purposes of foreign exchange gains or losses. See pages 11
through 13 for additional tax information for United States shareholders.

F. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

G. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial  statements  are presented in United States  dollars.

2 CUSTODIAN FEES For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the Company reversed its
accrual as of  November  30,  2005 in the amount of  $159,342 as a result of the
resolution of the fee structure related to custodian services.

3  RETIREMENT   PLANS  In  1994,   the  Company   entered  into  a  supplemental
non-qualified  pension  agreement  with its  Chairman.  Under  the  terms of the
agreement,  the  Company  agreed  to  credit  $25,000  per year for five  years,
beginning  December 1, 1993,  to a  Supplemental  Pension  Account with interest
credited at an annual rate of 3.5%.

   The Board of Directors  approved increases in the amount of the annual credit
as  follows:  $28,125 in May 1999;  $31,250 in February  2002,  $45,000 in March
2003, $55,000 in February 2004, $60,000 in March 2005 and $66,000 in March 2006.
As a result,  the Company has  recorded an expense of $33,000 for the six months
ended May 31, 2006.

   The  Company has  recorded an asset in the amount of $170,000  related to the
retirement  obligation  liability of $504,467 as of May 31,  2006.  The $504,467
represents the total liability payable under the agreement at May 31, 2006. Upon
retirement from the Company, the liability under the agreement is payable in ten
consecutive equal annual payments to the Chairman.

   During the fiscal year ended  November  30,  2005,  the  Company  recorded an
actuarially determined unfunded liability for retirement benefits due to current
and  future  retired  directors.  Directors  of the  Company  qualify to receive
retirement    benefits   if   they   have   served   the   Company    (and   its
predecessor, ASA Limited) for at least twelve years prior to retirement.  During
the six months ended May 31, 2006 the Company  recorded a net benefit of $46,772
in the  statement  of  operations  for this  item due to the  death of a retired
director.

4  ASA LIMITED  In  connection  with the  winding up of ASA Limited, the Company
incurred expenses of $552,031 for the six months ended May 31, 2006. This amount
includes a severance payment of $500,673 to Ronald L. McCarthy,  former Managing
Director.

5 CONCENTRATION RISK It is a fundamental policy of the Company that at least 80%
of its total assets be invested in securities of companies engaged,  directly or
indirectly,  in the exploration,  mining or processing of gold or other precious
minerals and/or in other gold and precious  mineral  investments.  A substantial
portion of the Company's assets currently is invested in South African companies
and other companies having significant assets or operations in South Africa. The
Company is, therefore,  subject to gold and precious metal related risks as well
as risks related to investing in South Africa,  including  political,  economic,
regulatory,  currency  fluctuation  and foreign  exchange  risks. As a result of
industry consolidation, the Company currently is invested in a limited number of
securities  and thus holds large  positions in certain  securities.  Because the
Company's  investments  are  concentrated  in a limited  number of securities of
companies involved in the mining of gold and other precious minerals and related
activities,  the net  asset  value of the  Company  may be  subject  to  greater
volatility than that of a more broadly diversified investment company.

6 INDEMNIFICATIONS  In the ordinary course of business,  the Company enters into
contracts  that contain a variety of  indemnifications.  The  Company's  maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Company has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification  provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.



                                                                               9

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited:

     We have reviewed the  accompanying  statement of assets and  liabilities of
ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited,  including the schedule of  investments,  as of May 31,
2006,  and  the  related  statements  of  operations,  changes  in  net  assets,
supplementary  information  and financial  highlights  for the six-month  period
ended  May 31,  2006.  These  financial  statements,  financial  highlights  and
supplementary information are the responsibility of the Company's management.

     A review of interim financial  information consists principally of applying
analytical  procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial
and  accounting  matters.  It is  substantially  less in scope  than an audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board,
the objective of which is the  expression of an opinion  regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

     Based on our review,  we are not aware of any material  modifications  that
should be made to the interim financial statements referred to above for them to
be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

     We have previously  audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting  Oversight Board, the statements of changes in net assets for
the year ended  November 30, 2005 and financial  highlights for each of the four
years in the period ended  November 30, 2005 and in our report,  dated  December
28, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial  statements and
financial  highlights.  The financial highlights for the year ended November 30,
2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased  operations and whose report
dated  December 18, 2001  expressed  an  unqualifed  opinion on those  financial
highlights.

CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION FOR
UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

From  December 1, 1963 through  November 30, 1987,  the Company was treated as a
"foreign  investment  company"  for United  States  federal  income tax purposes
pursuant to Section 1246 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Under that  section,  a
United States  shareholder  who has held his shares in the Company for more than
one year is subject to tax at  ordinary  income tax rates on his profit (if any)
on a sale of his shares to the extent of his  "ratable  share" of the  Company's
earnings  and  profits  accumulated  for the period  during  which he held those
shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987.  If such  shareholder's
profit on the sale of his  shares  exceeds  such  ratable  share and he held his
shares for more than one year,  then,  subject to the discussion below regarding
the United States  federal  income tax rules  applicable to taxable years of the
Company  beginning  after  November 30, 1987,  he is subject to tax at long-term
capital gain rates on the excess.

   The Company's per share earnings and profits  accumulated  (undistributed) in
each of the taxable years from 1964 through 1987 is available  upon request from
LGN Group, LLC, P.O. Box 269, Florham Park, NJ 07932.

   Under  rules  enacted  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  the  Company  became a
"passive foreign investment  company" (a "PFIC") on December 1, 1987. The manner
in which these rules apply depends on whether a United

                                                                              11
<PAGE>

States  shareholder (1) elects to treat the Company as a qualified electing fund
("QEF") with respect to his Company  shares,  (2) for taxable  years of a United
States shareholder beginning after December 31, 1997, elects to "mark-to-market"
his Company  shares as of the close of each taxable  year,  or (3) makes neither
election.

   In general,  if a United  States  shareholder  of the  Company  does NOT make
either such election, any gain realized on the disposition of his Company shares
will be treated as  ordinary  income.  In  addition,  such  shareholder  will be
subject to an  "interest  charge" on part of his tax  liability  with respect to
such  gain,  as well as with  respect to an  "excess  distribution"  made by the
Company (as explained in the following paragraph).  Furthermore,  shares held by
such a  shareholder  may be  denied  the  benefit  of any  otherwise  applicable
increase in tax basis at death.  Under  proposed  regulations,  a  "disposition"
would include a U.S. taxpayer's becoming a nonresident alien.

  As noted, the general tax consequences  described in the preceding  paragraph
apply to an "excess  distribution"  on Company  shares,  which is defined as the
total distri-butions by the Company a shareholder receives during a taxable year
that are more  than 125% of the  average  amount  it  distributed  for the three
preceding taxable years.* If the Company makes an excess distribution in a year,
a United States  shareholder who has not made a QEF or  mark-to-market  election
would be required to allocate the excess amount  ratably over the ENTIRE holding
period for his shares.  That allocation would result in tax being payable at the
highest  applicable rate in the prior taxable years to which the distribution is
allocated and interest charges being imposed on the resulting  "underpayment" of
taxes made in those years.  In contrast,  a  distribution  that is not an excess
distribution  would  be  taxable  to a  United  States  shareholder  as a normal
dividend,** with no interest charge.

   If a United  States  shareholder  elects to treat the  Company  as a QEF with
respect to his  shares  therein  for his first  year he holds his shares  during
which the Company is a PFIC (or later makes the QEF  election and also elects to
treat his shares  generally  as if they were sold for their fair market value on
the  first  day of the  first  taxable  year of the  Company  for  which the QEF
election is effective,  in which event the gain from such "deemed sale" would be
treated  as an  excess  distribution),  the  rules  described  in the  preceding
paragraphs  generally  would not apply.  Instead,  the  electing  United  States
shareholder would include annually in his gross income his PRO RATA share of the
Company's   ordinary  earnings  and  net  capital  gain  (his  "QEF"  inclusion)
regardless  of whether  such income or gain was actually  distributed.  A United
States shareholder who makes a valid QEF election will recognize capital gain on
any profit  from the  actual  sale of his  shares if those  shares  were held as
capital assets,  except to the extent of the shareholder's  ratable share of the
earnings and profits of the Company  accumulated  for the period during which he
held those shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987, as described
above.

   Alternatively,  if a  United  States  shareholder  makes  the  mark-to-market
election with respect to Company shares for taxable years  beginning on or after
January 1, 1998,  such  shareholder  would be  required  annually  to report any
unrealized  gain  with  respect  to his  shares  as  ordinary  income,  and  any
unrealized  loss would be permitted as an ordinary  loss, but only to the extent
of previous inclusions of ordinary income. Any gain subsequently  realized by an
electing United States shareholder on a sale or other disposition of his Company
shares also would be treated as ordinary income,  but such shareholder would not
be subject to an interest  charge on his resulting tax liability.  Special rules
apply to a United States shareholder that held his PFIC stock prior to his first
taxable year for which the mark-to-market election was effective.

   A United States  shareholder with a valid QEF election in effect would not be
taxed  on any  distributions  paid  by the  Company  to the  extent  of any  QEF
inclusions,  but any  distributions  out of accumulated  earnings and profits in
excess thereof would be treated as taxable  dividends.  Such a shareholder would
increase the tax basis in his Company shares by the amount of any QEF inclusions
and reduce  such tax basis by any  distributions  to him that are not taxable as
described  in the  preceding  sentence.  Special  rules  apply to United  States
shareholders  who make the QEF  election and wish to defer the payment of tax on
their annual QEF inclusions.

   Each  shareholder  who desires QEF  treatment  must  individually  elect such
treatment. The QEF election must be made for the taxable year of the shareholder
in which or with which the taxable  year of the Company  ends. A QEF election is
effective  for the  shareholder's  taxable  year  for  which  it is made and all
subsequent  taxable years of the  shareholder and may not be revoked without the
consent of the Internal Revenue Service.  A shareholder of the Company who first
held his Company shares after

* For example,  the Company made annual distributions of $.90, $.55 and $.80 per
share during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,  an average per year of $.75 per
share.  Accordingly,  any  distribution  in excess of $.9375 per share  (125% of
$.75) would be treated as an excess distribution for 2006. (All amounts in U.S.
currency.)

** Because the Company is a PFIC, dividends it pays will not qualify for the 15%
maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on dividends that  individuals  receive and
instead will be taxed at rates up to 35%.

November  30, 2005 and who files his tax return on the basis of a calendar  year
may make a QEF election on his 2006 tax return. A shareholder of the Company who
first held his Company  shares on or before  November 30, 2005 may also make the
QEF  election  on his  2006  tax  return  but  should  consult  his tax  advisor
concerning the tax consequences and special rules that apply when a QEF election
could have been made with respect to such shares for an earlier taxable year.

   A QEF election must be made by the due date, with extensions,  of the federal
income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is to apply. Under
Treasury  regulations,  a QEF election is made on Internal  Revenue Service Form
8621,  which must be completed  and attached to a timely filed income tax return
in which the shareholder reports his QEF inclusion for the taxable year to which
the election applies.  In order to allow United States  shareholders to make QEF
elections and to comply with the applicable annual reporting  requirements,  the
Company annually provides them a "PFIC Annual Information  Statement" containing
certain information required by Treasury regulations.

   In early 2007, the Company will send to United States  shareholders  the PFIC
Annual  Information  Statement for the Company's 2006 taxable year.  Such annual
information  statement  may be used for  purposes  of  completing  Form 8621.  A
shareholder  who either is subject  to a prior QEF  election  or is making a QEF
election for the first time must attach a completed  Form 8621 to his income tax
return each year.  Other United States  shareholders  also must attach completed
Forms 8621 to their tax returns  each year,  but  shareholders  not electing QEF
treatment will not need to report QEF inclusions thereon.

   Special rules apply to United States  persons who hold Company shares through
intermediate  entities or persons and to United States shareholders who directly
or indirectly pledge their shares, including those in a margin account.

   Ordinarily, the tax basis that is obtained by a transferee of property on the
death of the owner of that  property is adjusted to the  property's  fair market
value on the date of death (or  alternate  valuation  date).  If a United States
shareholder  dies  owning  shares  with  respect  to which he did not  elect QEF
treatment  (or elected such  treatment  after the first taxable year in which he
owned shares in which the Company was a PFIC and did not elect to recognize gain
as  described  above),  the  transferee  of those shares will not be entitled to
adjust  the tax  basis in such  shares to the fair  market  value on the date of
death (or alternate valuation date). In that case, in general, the transferee of
such shares  will take a basis in the shares  equal to the  shareholder's  basis
therein immediately before his death. If a United States shareholder dies owning
Company  shares for which a valid QEF  election  was in effect  for all  taxable
years in such  shareholder's  holding period during which the Company was a PFIC
(or the  shareholder  made a "deemed sale  election"),  then the basis  increase
generally will be available unless the holding period for his shares began on or
prior to November  30,  1987.  In the latter  case,  in general,  any  otherwise
applicable  basis  increase  will be reduced to the extent of the  shareholder's
ratable  share of the  earnings and profits of the Company  accumulated  for the
period during which he held those shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November
30, 1987.

   DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE APPLICABLE TAX RULES, UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS
OF THE COMPANY ARE STRONGLY  URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS  CONCERNING
THE  IMPACT  OF THESE  RULES ON THEIR  INVESTMENT  IN THE  COMPANY  AND ON THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS.


                                                                              13

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)

   Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") has been engaged to offer
a dividend  reinvestment  and stock purchase plan (the "Plan") to  shareholders.
Shareholders  may elect to participate in the Plan by signing an  authorization.
The  authorization  appoints  Computershare as agent to apply to the purchase of
common  shares of the Company in the open market (i) all cash  dividends  (after
deduction of the service  charge  described  below) that become  payable to such
participant on the Company's shares  (including  shares registered in his or her
name  and  shares  accumulated  under  the  Plan)  and (ii)  any  optional  cash
investments ($50 minimum, subject to an annual maximum of $60,000) received from
such participant.

   For the  purpose  of making  purchases,  Computershare  will  commingle  each
participant's  funds with those of all other participants in the Plan. The price
per  share of  shares  purchased  for each  participant's  account  shall be the
average price (including brokerage  commissions and any other costs of purchase)
of all shares  purchased in the open market with the net funds  available from a
cash dividend and any voluntary cash payments being concurrently  invested.  Any
stock  dividends or split shares  distributed on shares held in the Plan will be
credited to the participant's account.

   For each  participant,  a service charge of 5% of the combined  amount of the
participant's dividend and any voluntary payment being concurrently invested, up
to a maximum  charge  of $2.50 per  participant  plus  $.03 per  share,  will be
deducted  (and  paid  to  Computershare)  prior  to  each  purchase  of  shares.
Shareholder  sales of shares held by  Computershare in the Plan are subject to a
fee of $10.00  plus  $.12 per  share  deducted  from the  proceeds  of the sale.
Additional  nominal fees are charged by Computershare  for specific  shareholder
requests such as requests for  information  regarding share cost basis detail in
excess of two prior  years and for  replacement  1099  reports  older than three
years.

   Participation  in the Plan may be terminated by a participant  at any time by
written  instructions to  Computershare.  Upon  termination,  a participant will
receive a  certificate  for the full  number of  shares  credited  to his or her
account, unless he or she requests the sale of all or part of such shares.

   Dividends  reinvested  by a  shareholder  under  the Plan will  generally  be
treated for U.S.  federal  income tax  purposes in the same manner as  dividends
paid to such shareholder in cash. See "Certain tax information for United States
shareholders" for more information  regarding tax consequences to U.S. investors
of an investment in shares of the Company, including the effect of the Company's
status as a PFIC.  The  amount of the  service  charge  is  deductible  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to limitations.

   To  participate  in the Plan an investor  may not hold his or her shares in a
"street name" brokerage account.

   Additional information regarding the Plan may be obtained from Computershare,
P.O. Box 43081, Providence,  RI 02940-3081.  Information may also be obtained on
the internet at  WWW.COMPUTERSHARE.COM/EQUISERVE  or by calling  Computershare's
Telephone  Response  Center at  781-575-2723  between  9:00 a.m.  and 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern time, Monday through Friday.

                         report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
                         likely to materially affect, the registrant's  internal
                         control over financial reporting.

I, Robert J.A. Irwin, certify that:

          1.   I have  reviewed  this  report  on Form  N-CSR  of ASA  (Bermuda)
               Limited;

          2.   Based on my  knowledge,  this  report does not contain any untrue
               statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact
               necessary  to  make  the   statements   made,  in  light  of  the
               circumstances   under  which  such   statements  were  made,  not
               misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

          3.   Based  on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other
               financial  information included in this report, fairly present in
               all  material  respects  the  financial  condition,   results  of
               operations,  changes  in net  assets,  and  cash  flows  (if  the
               financial  statements are required to include a statement of cash
               flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
               the report;

          4.   I am responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure
               controls and  procedures  (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c)  under the
               Investment  Company  Act  of  1940)  and  internal  control  over
               financial  reporting  (as  defined  in Rule  30a-3(d)  under  the
               Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

               a.   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused
                    such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                    my supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                    to the registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries,
                    is  made  known  to  me by  others  within  those  entities,
                    particularly during the period in which this report is being
                    prepared;

               b.   Designed such internal control over financial reporting,  or
                    caused such internal control over financial  reporting to be
                    designed  under  my  supervision,   to  provide   reasonable
                    assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
                    and the  preparation  of financial  statements  for external
                    purposes in accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting
                    principles;

               c.   Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure
                    controls  and  procedures  and  presented  in this report my
                    conclusions   about  the  effectiveness  of  the  disclosure
                    controls and  procedures,  as of a date within 90 days prior
                    to the filing date of this report based on such  evaluation;
                    and

               d.   Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's
                    internal  control over  financial  reporting  that  occurred
                    during the second  fiscal  quarter of the period  covered by
                    this report that has materially  affected,  or is reasonably
                    likely  to  materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
                    control over financial reporting; and

<PAGE>

          5.   I have  disclosed  to the  registrant's  auditors  and the  audit
               committee  of the  registrant's  board of  directors  (or persons
               performing the equivalent functions):

               a.   All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                    design or  operation  of  internal  control  over  financial
                    reporting  which are reasonably  likely to adversely  affect
                    the registrant's ability to record, process,  summarize, and
                    report financial information; and

               b.   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                    or  other  employees  who  have a  significant  role  in the
                    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
