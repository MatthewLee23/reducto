             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Members of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC


In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2005, and the results of its operations, the changes in its members' capital,
its cash flows and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of investments at March 31, 2005 with the
custodian and portfolio funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by the
Fund valued at $175,951,080 (98.16% of the Fund's net assets), at March 31,
2005, the values of which have been fair valued by the Investment Manager based
on estimates provided by each portfolio fund, under the general supervision of
the Board of Directors, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values.
These estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences
could be material.

The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable by the average of total monthly  members'  capital.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

1.   ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
investment  company and which has many of the  features of a private  investment
fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both  "accredited  investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and  "qualified  clients"  under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment  objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an  attractive,  long-term  rate  of  return,  on  an  absolute  as  well  as  a
risk-adjusted  basis,  with low performance  volatility and minimal  correlation
with the equity and fixed income  markets.  The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in approximately  25-50 partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio
Funds") managed by different  investment managers and (ii) construct a portfolio
employing  various  arbitrage and equity  strategies to achieve the risk control
benefits  of  diversification  together  with the  value of a hedged  investment
approach.

Effective  December  4,  2004,  Banc  of  America  Investment   Advisors,   Inc.
("Adviser")  (formerly  known as Liberty  Asset  Management  Company) is the SEC
registered   investment  adviser  to  the  Fund.  The  Adviser  is  an  indirect
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Bank  of  America  Corporation  ("BOA").  Prior  to
December 4, 2004, Columbia Management Advisors,  Inc. ("CMA") was the investment
adviser to the Fund.  Prior to April 1, 2004, CMA was an indirect,  wholly owned
subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April
1, 2004,  FleetBoston  was acquired by BOA.  The Adviser has retained  Grosvenor
Capital Management,  L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the
Fund. The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated as special  members
(the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The  Fund's  investments  are  fair  valued  by the  Adviser  or  Subadviser  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably  determine the value of its investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments in Portfolio  Funds are generally  valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values,  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the identified cost basis.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the Members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E.   CASH

At March 31,  2005,  a total of  $1,347,055  in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust  Company,  the Fund's  custodian.  Of that amount,  $645,536 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

F.   ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING EXPENSES

The Adviser entered into an expense  deferral  agreement (the "Expense  Deferral
Agreement") with the Fund dated December 19, 2002, as amended December 31, 2002,
whereby the Fund,  upon request of the Adviser,  agreed to repay $366,088 to the
Adviser for organizational and initial offering costs advanced by the Adviser on
behalf of the Fund, subject to certain conditions. Such repayment was contingent
upon the expenses of the Fund (exclusive of brokerage costs, interest,  taxes or
extraordinary expenses and management fees or performance-based fees paid by the
Fund),  including such repayment,  being limited to no more than 0.75% per annum
of  average  members'  capital  of the  Fund.  The  Expense  Deferral  Agreement
terminates  on April 1,  2006,  and the  Fund  has no  obligation  to pay to the
Adviser any  organizational  or initial offering costs still  outstanding to the
Adviser as of that date.  Expenses  deferred  pursuant to the  Expense  Deferral
Agreement  have been  treated as  contingent  liabilities  of the Fund until the
point at which the criteria  specified in the Expense  Deferral  Agreement  have
been satisfied. Upon satisfaction of the criteria, the expenses are reflected as
organizational  fees reimbursed to the Adviser.  During the year ended March 31,
2004, the Adviser requested  reimbursement of $73,930 in deferred expenses,  and
the Adviser agreed to permanently  forego  reimbursement  of $28,623 in deferred
expenses.   During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2005,  the  Adviser  requested
reimbursement  of  $220,497  in  deferred  expenses,  and this  amount  has been
reflected in the statement of operations as  organizational  fees  reimbursed to
Adviser.  The Adviser agreed to permanently  forego $43,038 of  reimbursement of
deferred expenses during the year ended March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, no
amounts remain outstanding pursuant to the Expense Deferral Agreement.

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar  year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all Member's  Interest;  (iii) the
withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection with such party ceasing to
serve as Adviser or Subadviser to the Fund; or (iv) the dissolution of the Fund.
The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special  Members) for an Incentive
Period  equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of (a) profit net of losses
(after taking into account  expenses,  including the  management fee paid by the
Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for such Incentive Period over
(b) the greater of (i) the Member's Hurdle Rate Amount for that Incentive Period
and (ii) the  balance in the  Member's  Loss  Carryforward  as of the end of the
prior Incentive Period. A Member's "Loss Carryforward" for the initial Incentive
Period is zero and for each Incentive Period thereafter is equal to the Member's
Loss Carryforward as of the end of the immediately  preceding  Incentive Period,
increased  or  decreased,  but not  below  zero,  by the  positive  or  negative
difference  between the net losses over net profits  allocated to the Member for
the current  Incentive  Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member
would  receive if its  Interest as of the  beginning  of that  Incentive  Period
(adjusted  appropriately  for any  additional  contributions)  earned  a rate of
return equal to the one-year U.S.  Treasury note, as determined on the first day
of each calendar  quarter and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.
The Hurdle Rate Amount is not  cumulative  from  Incentive  Period to  Incentive
Period. The Hurdle Rate Amount for June 30, 2004,  September 30, 2004,  December
31,  2004,  and March 31, 2005 is 1.189%,  2.008%,  2.195% and 2.802% per annum,
respectively.  On December  31, 2004 an  incentive  allocation  of $624,322  was
realized.  Additional  capital of $84,598  would  have been  reallocable  to the
Special  Members had the Members'  measurement  period for incentive  allocation
closed on March 31, 2005.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



3.   MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Each director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $1,250 for each
meeting attended. Any director or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund. All directors are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective  October 1, 2004, the Board of Directors  appointed a Chief Compliance
Officer  ("CCO")  to  the  Fund  in  accordance  with  the  federal   securities
regulation. The Fund, along with other affiliated funds, paid its pro-rata share
of the expenses associated with the Office of the CCO. At March 31, 2005, $4,678
was expensed to Other expense on the Statement of Operations. Effective April 1,
2005, the CCO expense will be paid by the Adviser.

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)  serves as
administrator  and  accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides
certain accounting,  record keeping, tax and investor related services. The Fund
pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily upon
month-end Members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

5.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

5.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2004 and December 31, 2004. The interests  redeemed pursuant to such tenders are
shown in the Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

6.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined by the Board in its discretion

6.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

and such  repurchase  amount may  represent  only a small  portion of the Fund's
outstanding  Interests.  Because  the  Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds
themselves have limited liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund significant
repurchases.  Members whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the
risk that the Fund's members'  capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the
time  that  they  submit  their  request  for  repurchase  and  the  date of the
repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

7.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

Aggregate  purchases  of  Portfolio  Funds for the year  ended  March  31,  2005
amounted to  $56,403,299,  including  $4,500,000 in purchases of Portfolio Funds
paid in advance of Portfolio Fund  openings.  Portfolio  Fund  investments  sold
during the year ended March 31, 2005 amounted to $12,151,469.

7.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS (CONTINUED)

At March 31, 2005,  the Adviser and  Subadviser  are unaware of any  significant
issuer concentrations in the underlying Portfolio Funds.

8.   LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On  September 3, 2003,  the Office of the Attorney  General for the State of New
York  ("NYAG")   simultaneously   filed  and  settled  a  complaint  against  an
unaffiliated  hedge fund and its managers in  connection  with an  investigation
into  improper  mutual fund trading  practices  with certain  families of mutual
funds,  including the Nations Funds family ("Funds"),  for which an affiliate of
the Adviser serves as distributor. Specifically, the NYAG alleged that the hedge
fund and its managers  engaged in activities  that it  characterized  as "market
timing" and also "late trading."

On March 15, 2004, Bank of America  Corporation  reached agreements in principle
with the NYAG and the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC")  over
matters  related to late trading and market  timing of mutual  funds.  To settle
these matters,  on February 9, 2005,  BACAP  Distributors,  LLC, Bank of America
Capital  Management,  LLC and Banc of America  Securities  LLC,  entered into an
Assurance  of  Discontinuance  with  the NYAG and  consented  to the  entry of a
cease-and-desist  order by the SEC. These settlements contain  substantially the
same terms and conditions outlined in the agreements in principle.

Since September 5, 2003, a number of lawsuits have been filed in connection with
these  circumstances.  A number of the Adviser's  affiliates  have been named as
defendants in some of these lawsuits in connection with their relationships with
the  Nations  Funds.   More  than  200  cases  have  been   consolidated   in  a
multi-district  proceeding  and  transferred  to the Federal  District  Court in
Maryland.

8.   LITIGATION EVENT (CONTINUED)

On April 1, 2004, Bank of America  Corporation  acquired Fleet Boston  Financial
Corporation  ("Fleet").  As a result of this  acquisition,  Columbia  Management
Advisors,  Inc. ("CMA") and Columbia Funds  Distributor,  Inc.  ("CFDI") are now
indirect wholly-owned  subsidiaries of Bank of America Corporation.  The SEC and
NYAG filed  proceedings  against both CMA and CFDI on February 24, 2004 alleging
that they had  violated  certain  provisions  of the federal  securities  law in
connection with trading activity in mutual funds shares and violated certain New
York anti-fraud  statutes.  In March 2004, Fleet reached agreements in principle
with the NYAG and the SEC relating to these matters. To settle these matters, on
February 9, 2005, CMA and CFDI entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance  with
the NYAG and consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the SEC, each
of which contains  substantially  the same terms and conditions  outlined in the
agreements in principle.

The   settlements   with  the  SEC  are   available  on  the  SEC's  website  at
http://www.sec.gov.  The settlements  with the NYAG are available as part of the
Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

9.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Effective April 1, 2005, the Fund received  additional capital  contributions of
$1,750,000.

Effective May 1, 2005,  the Fund's  Adviser  changed its name to Banc of America
Investment Advisors, Inc.







The Fund files its complete  schedule of portfolio  holdings with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on
Form N-Q within  sixty days after the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is
available on the Commission's website at HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV, and may be reviewed
and  copied  at the  Commission's  Public  Reference  Room in  Washington,  D.C.

                            POLICY FOR ENGAGEMENT OF
                             INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                        FOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES



                                   MARCH 2005


I.   Objective

This Policy for Engagement of Independent Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit
Services (the "Policy") sets forth the understanding of the Audit Committee of
the Board of Managers of BAMS, the Board of Managers of BOS and the Board of
Directors of CMHF regarding the engagement of each Fund's(1) independent
accountants to provide:

     A. Audit and permissible audit-related, tax and other services to the Fund;

     B. Non-audit services to the Fund's Investment Adviser (as defined in
Section V.E. below), and any Control Affiliates (as defined in Section V.E.
below) of such Investment Adviser, that relate directly to the Fund's operations
and financial reporting; and

     C. Certain other audit and non-audit services to the Fund's Investment
Adviser and its Control Affiliates.



The purpose of this policy is to ensure each Fund's accountants' independence
and objectivity with respect to their audit services to the Fund.

II.  Background

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act") and related rules that the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has issued, and in accordance with
each Fund's Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for the
appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of each Fund's independent
accountants. The Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit
services that each Fund's independent accountants provide to the Fund, as well
as all non-audit services that they provide to the Fund's Investment Adviser or
any Control Affiliate of the Investment Adviser that relate directly to the
Fund's operations and financial reporting, before the engagement commences.
There are a number of services that independent accountants are not permitted to
perform, even with audit committee pre-approval. These services are listed in
Exhibit I.

The SEC's rules provide guidance on audit committee pre-approvals of services
provided by an accounting firm and require the audit committee to pre-approve
services by either:

- ----------------------------

(1)  "Fund" means BAMS, BOS and CMHF. All of them together may be referred to as
     the "Funds."

                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>

     A. Establishing pre-approval policies and procedures under which the
engagement with the independent accountants is permitted ("general
pre-approval"). The policies and procedures must be detailed as to the
particular service for which the independent accountants may be engaged, must
not include delegation of the audit committee's responsibilities under the
Securities Act of 1934, as amended, to management, and the audit committee must
be informed of each service provided based on general pre-approval, or

     B. Expressly approving the engagement of the independent accountants before
the accountants are engaged ("specific pre-approval").



This Policy incorporates both specific pre-approval and general pre-approval.
The Audit Committee believes that this combination results in an effective and
efficient procedure for pre-approving services performed by the independent
accountants. Under this Policy, unless a type of service receives general
pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is
to be provided by the independent accountants. Exhibit II to this Policy
describes the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and All Other Services that each Fund's
independent accountants may perform for the Fund (collectively, "Fund Services")
that the Audit Committee has approved by general pre-approval.

III. Delegation

As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may delegate
either type of pre-approval authority to any designated member or members of the
Audit Committee who are independent directors. The member or members to whom
this authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any
pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. The
Audit Committee is not permitted to delegate responsibilities with respect to
the pre-approval of services performed by the independent accountants to
management.

IV.  General Procedures

The independent accountants must not commence any engagement for a service
covered by this Policy that has not been pre-approved by either general
pre-approval or specific pre-approval.

          1.   General Pre-Approval

On an annual basis, at a regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, each
Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee must submit to the Audit Committee
schedules of the types of Fund Services and Fund-related Adviser Services (as
defined in Section V.E. below) that are proposed for general pre-approval.

These schedules, substantially in the form of Exhibits II (for Fund Services)
and III (for Fund-related Advisor Services), must provide a description of each
type of service that is proposed for general pre-approval and, where possible,
estimated fee caps for each instance of providing each service. The services and
related fees (where provided) should generally cover a one-year period (for
example, from April 1 through March 31 of the following year). The Audit
Committee must review the types of services and projected fees included in the
schedules and may modify the

                                                                             -5-
<PAGE>

schedules (including by adding or subtracting services). If the Audit Committee
approves the schedules, this approval indicates that the specific types of
services on the schedules, at the fee levels projected, are pre-approved by
general pre-approval. Approved schedules must be attached to this policy;
current approved schedules are attached to this Policy as Exhibits II and III.
The Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee must update the fee amounts listed
in Exhibits II and III to the extent necessary at each of the regularly
scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may revise
Exhibits II and III from time to time, but subsequent revisions do not affect
the pre-approved status of engagements already commenced that were pre-approved
at the time of commencement.

          2.   Specific Pre-Approval

If a Fund, its Investment Adviser or a Control Affiliate wishes to engage a
Fund's independent accountants to perform a service not included in Exhibits II
or III:

     B. Management must prepare a brief written request detailing the proposed
engagement, with an explanation as to why the service is proposed to be
performed by the independent accountants (E.G., particular expertise, timing,
etc.).

     C. Management must deliver the request to the Audit Committee and deliver a
copy of the request to the Fund's Treasurer.

     D. The Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee must arrange for a
discussion of the service to be included on the agenda for the next regularly
scheduled Audit Committee meeting, at which the Audit Committee will discuss the
proposed engagement and approve or deny the request.

     E. If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee, the
Chairperson of the Audit Committee may, in his or her discretion, either approve
or deny the request on behalf of the Audit Committee or call a special meeting
of the Audit Committee to consider the proposal. Should the Chairperson of the
Audit Committee be unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee may
serve as an alternate for the purpose of approving or denying the request or
calling a special meeting of the Audit Committee. The Fund's Treasurer or his or
her designee is responsible for discussing the project with the Chairperson (or
alternate, if necessary).



V.   Additional Procedures

          1.   Audit Services to the Fund

Audit services include the annual financial statement audit, other procedures
that the independent accountants must perform to form an opinion on the Fund's
financial statements and other services customarily required by the Fund in the
ordinary course of operations.


                                                                             -6-
<PAGE>

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services of the type described in
Exhibit II. All other permissible Audit services not listed in Exhibit II must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (see Section IV.B above).

The Audit Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement throughout the
year and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in terms and conditions
resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure or other items (see
Section IV.B. above).

          2.   Audit-related Services to the Fund

Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's financial
statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent accountants.
The Audit Committee believes that the provision of Audit-related services does
not impair the independence of the accountants and is consistent with the SEC's
rules on accountants' independence.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services of the type
described in Exhibit II. All other permissible Audit-related services not listed
in Exhibit II must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (see
Section IV.B. above).

          3.   Tax Services to the Fund

The Audit Committee believes that the independent accountants can provide Tax
services such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice to the Fund without
impairing the accountants' independence. The SEC's rules on accountant
independence permit independent accountants to provide such tax services if
pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Tax services of the type described in
Exhibit II. All other permissible Tax services not listed in Exhibit II must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (see Section IV.B. above).

          4.   All Other Services to the Fund

The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
independent accountants from providing specific non-audit services (as listed in
Exhibit I), that other types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly,
the Audit Committee believes it may grant general pre-approval to those
permissible non-audit services classified as All Other Services that it believes
are routine and recurring services, would not impair the independence of the
accountants and are consistent with the SEC's rules on accountant independence.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other Services of the type
described in Exhibit II. Permissible All Other Services not listed in Exhibit II
must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (see Section IV.B.
above).

          5.   Fund-related Services Provided to Adviser Entities

The engagement of the independent accountants to provide non-audit services to a
Fund's investment adviser, or any Control Affiliates, that relate directly to
the Fund's operations and

                                                                             -7-
<PAGE>

financial reporting (referred to as "Fund-related Adviser Services") must be
approved by the Fund's Audit Committee before the commencement of any such
engagement. For purposes of this Policy, the term "Control Affiliate" means any
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment
Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund, and the term "Investment
Adviser" means the Fund's investment adviser, excluding any unaffiliated
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
or overseen by another investment adviser. Attached as Exhibit IV is a list of
parties deemed to be either an Investment Adviser to a Fund or a Control
Affiliate of any such Investment Adviser (collectively referred to herein as
"Adviser Entities") for purposes of this Policy.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Fund-related Adviser Services listed of
the type described in Exhibit III. Permissible other Fund-related Adviser
Services not listed in Exhibit III must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (see Section IV.B. above).

          6.   Certain Other Services Provided to Adviser Entities

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed to
be provided by a Fund's independent accountants to Adviser Entities are not
Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of this Policy, but nonetheless
may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing evaluation of the accountants'
independence and objectivity with respect to audit services provided to a Fund.
As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
accountants to provide audit or non-audit services that are not Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit
Committee, and the projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of
all such engagements during the period covered by this Policy) exceeds $250,000,
the independent accountants or the relevant Fund's Treasurer or his or her
designee must notify the Audit Committee not later than its next meeting. This
notification must include a general description of the services provided, the
entity that is to be the recipient of the services, the timing of the
engagement, the entity's reasons for selecting the independent accountants, and
the projected fees. This information will allow the Audit Committee to consider
whether non-audit services provided to the Adviser Entities, which were not
subject to Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the
accountants' independence with respect to the Fund.

          7.   De Minimis Exception

Pre-approval of services other than audit, review or attest services provided to
the Fund, the Adviser or Control Affiliates is not required, however, if the "de
minimis" requirements set forth in the SEC's rules are met. The Fund's Treasurer
or his or her designee is responsible for compliance with the notification and
other requirements set forth in the SEC's rules relating to the de minimis
exception.

VI.  Scope of Procedures

This Policy applies to both direct and indirect engagements of a Fund's
independent accountants. Indirect engagements are situations where the
independent accountants are engaged by a service provider to a Fund or Adviser
Entity at an Adviser Entity's explicit direction or recommendation


                                                                             -8-
<PAGE>

(E.G., the engagement of the independent accountants by counsel to an Adviser
Entity to provide services relating to a Fund or Adviser Entity.)

VII. Reporting to the Audit Committee

Each Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee must report to the Audit Committee
at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or Fund-related
Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered, including:

     A. A general description of the services, and

     B. Actual billed and projected fees, and

     C. The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser Services
were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.



In addition, each Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee must make sure that
the independent accountants report to the Audit Committee annually, and no more
than 90 days before the filing of audit reports with the SEC, all non-audit
services provided to entities in each Fund's "investment company complex" (as
defined by SEC rules) that did not require pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

VIII. Internal Controls

The Audit Committee expects each Fund's independent accountants to implement and
maintain effective internal controls to:

     A. Monitor the independent accountants' independence;

     B. Prevent the independent accountants from providing any impermissible
non-audit services to the Fund;

     C. Prevent the independent accountants from providing any Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services without first obtaining assurances that any
pre-approval required by this Policy has been obtained; and

     D. Annually disclose to the Audit Committee all relationships of which the
independent accountants are aware that may be reasonably thought to bear on the
accountants' independence in compliance with Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees. In addition, the
independent accountants shall tabulate, calculate and disclose their fees
annually for the above relationships.



The Audit Committee also expects each Fund's Treasurer or his or her designee to
develop, implement and maintain effective internal controls with respect to the
second and third items in


                                                                             -9-
<PAGE>

the list above and to tabulate and calculate the fees paid to the independent
accountants that are required to be disclosed in Fund disclosure documents and
reports (E.G., Form N-CSR and certain proxy statements).

IX.  Amendments; Annual Approval by Audit Committee

The Audit Committee may amend this Policy from time to time. Prompt notice of
any amendments will be provided to the independent accountants and each Fund's
Treasurer. The Audit Committee must review and approve this Policy at least
annually. Each approval of this Policy shall be deemed to constitute a new
prospective approval of those services of the type described in Exhibits II and
III as of the date of such approval.








                                                                            -10-
<PAGE>
                                                                       EXHIBIT I

The Securities and Exchange Commission's principles of independence are based on
three basic principles, violations of which would impair the accountants'
independence:

     A. The accountants cannot function in the role of management

     B. The accountants cannot audit their own work

     C. The accountants cannot serve in an advocacy role for the client



Under Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, independent accountants are
prohibited from providing specific non-audit services to audit clients
contemporaneously with the audit:

     D. Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
financial statements of the audit client

     E. Financial information systems design and implementation

     F. Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
contribution-in-kind reports

     G. Actuarial services

     H. Internal audit outsourcing services

     I. Management functions or human resources

     J. Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services

     K. Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit

     L. Any other services that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
determines, by regulation, is impermissible

<PAGE>


     (e) (2) 100% of  the  services  to the Funds  requiring  pre-approval  were
          approved by the audit committee.

     (f)  Not applicable.

     (g)  During the years ended March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005, aggregate
          non-audit fees of approximately $14.7 million and $24.9 million,
          respectively were billed by the Fund's principal accountant to the
          Fund's investment adviser (not including a sub-adviser whose role is
          primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by
          another investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by,
          or under common control with the investment adviser that provides
          ongoing services to the Fund.

     (h)  The  Fund's  audit  committee  considered  whether  the  provision  of
          non-audit  services  rendered to the Fund's  investment  adviser  (not
          including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily  portfolio  management
          and is sub-contracted or overseen by another  investment  adviser) and
          any entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with
          the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund that
          were not  pre-approved  is compatible  with  maintaining the principal
          accountant's independence.

POLICY:

ALL PROXIES(1) REGARDING CLIENT SECURITIES FOR WHICH COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT
ADVISORS, INC. ("CMA") HAS ASSUMED AUTHORITY TO VOTE SHALL, UNLESS CMA
DETERMINES IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICIES STATED BELOW TO ABSTAIN FROM VOTING, BE
VOTED IN A MANNER CONSIDERED BY CMA TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CMA'S CLIENTS,
INCLUDING THE CMG FAMILY FUNDS(2) AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY
RESULTING BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT TO CMA OR ITS AFFILIATES. THE BEST INTEREST OF
CLIENTS IS DEFINED FOR THIS PURPOSE AS THE INTEREST OF ENHANCING OR PROTECTING
THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF CLIENT ACCOUNTS, CONSIDERED AS A GROUP RATHER THAN
INDIVIDUALLY, AS CMA DETERMINES IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. IN THE
EVENT A CLIENT BELIEVES THAT ITS OTHER INTERESTS REQUIRE A DIFFERENT VOTE, CMA
SHALL VOTE AS THE CLIENT CLEARLY INSTRUCTS, PROVIDED CMA RECEIVES SUCH
INSTRUCTIONS IN TIME TO ACT ACCORDINGLY.

CMA ENDEAVORS TO VOTE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY, ALL PROXIES OF WHICH IT
BECOMES AWARE, SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS (UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED)
WHEN CMA EXPECTS TO ROUTINELY ABSTAIN FROM VOTING:

     1.  PROXIES WILL USUALLY NOT BE VOTED IN CASES WHERE THE SECURITY HAS BEEN
         LOANED FROM THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.

     2.  PROXIES WILL USUALLY NOT BE VOTED IN CASES WHERE CMA DEEMS THE COSTS TO
         THE CLIENT AND/OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE INCONVENIENCE OF VOTING THE
         SECURITY (E.G., SOME FOREIGN SECURITIES) OUTWEIGH THE BENEFIT OF DOING
         SO.

CMA SEEKS TO AVOID THE OCCURRENCE OF ACTUAL OR APPARENT MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST IN THE PROXY VOTING PROCESS BY VOTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREDETERMINED
VOTING GUIDELINES, AS STATED BELOW. FOR THOSE PROXY PROPOSALS THAT REQUIRE
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OR IN INSTANCES WHERE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY REQUIRE
VARYING FROM THE PREDETERMINED GUIDELINES, THE CMG PROXY COMMITTEE WILL
DETERMINE THE BEST INTEREST OF CMA'S CLIENTS AND VOTE ACCORDINGLY, WITHOUT
CONSIDERATION OF ANY RESULTING BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT TO CMA OR ITS AFFILIATES.

[GRAPHIC OMITTED]
OVERVIEW:

- ----------
(1) The term "proxy" as used herein refers to consents, elections and
authorizations solicited by any party with respect to securities of any sort.

(2) A CMG Family Fund or a Fund is a registered investment company or series of
a registered investment company managed or advised by Columbia Management
Advisors, Inc.

<PAGE>

CMA's policy is based upon its fiduciary obligation to act in its clients' best
interest. Citing this obligation, the SEC has adopted rules pursuant to the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Investment Company Act of 1940 with respect
to proxy voting.

PROCEDURE:

I.  ACCOUNT POLICIES

Except as otherwise directed by the client, CMA shall vote as follows:

SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS

CMA shall vote proxies on securities held in its separately managed accounts.

COLUMBIA TRUST COMPANY (CTC) TRUST POOLS

CMA shall vote proxies on securities held in the trust pools.

CMG FAMILY FUNDS/CMA FUND TRUST

CMA shall vote proxies on securities held in the Funds, including multi-managed
and subadvised Funds.

COLUMBIA PRIVATE PORTFOLIO

CMA shall vote proxies on securities held in its separately managed accounts.

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT GROUP

CMA's clients may invest in securities ("Alternative Investments") issued by
alternative investment vehicles (i.e. hedge funds, private equity funds, and
other alternative investment pools) that are structured as private limited
partnerships ("LPs"), limited liability companies ("LLCs") or offshore
corporations. Generally, CMA's Alternative Investment Group ("AIG") is the
platform through which CMA provides advisory services relating to Alternative
Investments.

The voting rights of Alternative Investments generally are rights of contract
set forth in the limited liability company or limited partnership agreement, in
the case of LLCs and LPs, or Memorandum and Articles of Association or By-laws,
in the case of offshore corporations. Also, as privately placed securities,
Alternative Investments generally are not subject to the regulatory scheme
applicable to public companies. Consequently, in most cases, proxies are not
solicited regarding Alternative Investment vehicles. Instead, consents may be
solicited from members, limited partners or shareholders.

Because of the unique characteristics of Alternative Investments, CMA has a
tailored process for voting Alternative Investment proxies and consents.

Process

AIG will vote all Alternative Investment proxies and consents in accordance with
this Policy. The committee voting AIG proxies consists of AIG senior management,
investment and operations professionals. Conflicts of interest are to be
monitored and resolved as set forth in this Policy.



II. PROXY COMMITTEE

CMA shall establish a Proxy Committee whose standing members shall include the
head of core equity, head of value, head of growth, head of income strategies,
head of equity research and head of fixed income research. Each standing member
may designate a senior portfolio manager or a senior analyst officer to act as a
substitute in a given matter on their behalf.

The Proxy Committee's functions shall include, in part,

         (a) direction of the vote on proposals where there has been a
         recommendation to the Committee, pursuant to Section IV.B, not to vote
         according to the predetermined Voting Guidelines stated in Section IV.A
         or on proposals which require special, individual consideration in
         accordance with Section IV.C;

         (b) review at least annually of this Proxy Voting Policy and Procedure
         to ensure consistency with internal policies, client disclosures and
         regulatory requirements;

         (c) review at least annually of existing Voting Guidelines and need for
         development of additional Voting


<PAGE>

         Guidelines to assist in the review of proxy proposals; and

         (d) development and modification of Voting Procedures, as stated in
         Section V, as it deems appropriate or necessary.

The Proxy Committee shall establish a charter, which shall set forth the
Committee's purpose, membership and operation. The Committee's charter shall be
consistent, in all material respects, with this policy and procedure.


III. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

With Other Bank of America Businesses
- -------------------------------------
Bank of America Corporation ("BAC"), the ultimate corporate parent of CMA, Bank
of America, N.A. and all of their numerous affiliates owns, operates and has
interests in many lines of business that may create or give rise to the
appearance of a conflict of interest between BAC or its affiliates and those of
Firm-advised clients. For example, the commercial and investment banking
business lines may have interests with respect to issuers of voting securities
that could appear to or even actually conflict with CMA's duty, in the proxy
voting process, to act in the best economic interest of its clients.

Within CMA
- ----------
Conflicts of interest may also arise from the business activities of CMA. For
example, CMA might manage (or be seeking to manage) the assets of a benefit plan
for an issuer. CMA may also be presented with an actual or apparent conflict of
interest where proxies of securities issued by BAC or a CMG Family Fund, for
which CMA serves as investment adviser, are to be voted for a client's account.

Management of Conflicts
- -----------------------
CMA's policy is to always vote proxies in the best interest of its clients, as a
whole, without regard to its own self-interest or that of its affiliates. BAC as
well as CMA has various compliance policies and procedures in place in order to
address any material conflicts of interest that might arise in this context.

     1.  BAC's enterprise-wide Code of Ethics specifically prohibits the flow of
         certain business-related information between associates on the
         commercial and/or investment banking side of the corporation and
         associates charged with trust or (as in the case of BACAP associates)
         non-trust fiduciary responsibilities, including investment
         decision-making and proxy voting.

     2.  In addition, BAC has adopted "Global Policies and Procedures Regarding
         Information Walls and Inside Information." Pursuant to these policies
         and procedures, "information barriers" have been established between
         various BAC business lines designed to prohibit the passage of certain
         information across those barriers.

     3.  Within CMA, CMA's Code of Ethics affirmatively requires that associates
         of CMA act in a manner whereby no actual or apparent conflict of
         interest may be seen as arising between the associate's interests and
         those of CMA's Clients.

     4.  By assuming his or her responsibilities pursuant to this Policy, each
         member of the Proxy Committee and any CMA or BAC associate advising or
         acting under the supervision or oversight of the Proxy Committee
         undertakes:

         o  To disclose to the chairperson of the Proxy Committee and the
            chairperson to the head of CMG Compliance any actual or apparent
            personal material conflicts of interest which he or she may have
            (e.g., by way of substantial ownership of securities, relationships
            with nominees for directorship, members of an issuer's or
            dissident's management or otherwise) in determining whether or how
            CMA shall vote proxies. In the event the chairperson of the Proxy
            Committee has a conflict of interest regarding a given matter, he or
            she shall abstain from participating in the Committee's
            determination of whether and/or how to vote in the matter; and

         o  To refrain from taking into consideration, in the decision as to
            whether or how CMA shall vote proxies:

               o  The existence of any current or prospective material business
                  relationship between CMA, BAC or any of their affiliates, on
                  one hand, and any party (or its affiliates) that is soliciting
                  or is otherwise interested in the proxies to be voted, on the
                  other hand; and/or
<PAGE>

               o  Any direct, indirect or perceived influence or attempt to
                  influence such action which the member or associate views as
                  being inconsistent with the purpose or provisions of this
                  Policy or the Code of Ethics of CMA or BAC.

Where a material conflict of interest is determined to have arisen in the proxy
voting process that may not be adequately mitigated by voting in accordance with
the predetermined Voting Guidelines, CMA's policy is to invoke one or more of
the following conflict management procedures:

     1.  Convene the Proxy Committee for the purpose of voting the affected
         proxies in a manner that is free of the conflict.

     2.  Causing the proxies to be voted in accordance with the recommendations
         of a qualified, independent third party, which may include CMA's proxy
         voting agent.

     3.  In unusual cases, with the Client's consent and upon ample notice,
         forwarding the proxies to CMA's clients so that they may vote the
         proxies directly.


IV. VOTING GUIDELINES

A. THE PROXY COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR VOTING PROXIES:

1. Matters Relating to the Board of Directors/Corporate Governance
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

CMA generally will vote FOR:

     o   Proposals for the election of directors or for an increase or decrease
         in the number of directors, provided that no more than one-third of the
         Board of Directors would, presently or at any time during the previous
         three-year period, be from management.


         However, CMA generally will WITHHOLD votes from pertinent director
         nominees if:

            (i)   the board as proposed to be constituted would have more than
                  one-third of its members from management;

            (ii)  the board does not have audit, nominating, and compensation
                  committees composed solely of directors who qualify as being
                  regarded as "independent," i.e. having no material
                  relationship, directly or indirectly, with the Company, as
                  CMA's proxy voting agent may determine (subject to the Proxy
                  Committee's contrary determination of independence or
                  non-independence);

            (iii) the nominee, as a member of the audit committee, permitted the
                  company to incur excessive non-audit fees (as defined below
                  regarding other business matters -- ratification of the
                  appointment of auditors);

            (iv)  a director serves on more than six public company boards;

            (v)   the CEO serves on more than two public company boards other
                  than the company's board.

         On a CASE-BY-CASE basis, CMA may WITHHOLD votes for a director nominee
         who has failed to observe good corporate governance practices or,
         through specific corporate action or inaction (e.g. failing to
         implement policies for which a majority of shareholders has previously
         cast votes in favor), has demonstrated a disregard for the interests of
         shareholders.

     o   Proposals requesting that the board audit, compensation and/or
         nominating committee be composed solely of independent directors. The
         Audit Committee must satisfy the independence and experience
         requirements established by the Securities and Exchange Commission
         ("SEC") and the New York Stock Exchange, or appropriate local
         requirements for foreign securities. At least one member of the Audit
         Committee must qualify as a "financial expert" in accordance with SEC
         rules.

     o   Proposals to declassify a board, absent special circumstances that
         would indicate that shareholder interests are better served by a
         classified board structure.
<PAGE>

CMA generally will vote FOR:

     o   Proposals to create or eliminate positions or titles for senior
         management. CMA generally prefers that the role of Chairman of the
         Board and CEO be held by different persons unless there are compelling
         reasons to vote AGAINST a proposal to separate these positions, such as
         the existence of a counter-balancing governance structure that includes
         at least the following elements in addition to applicable listing
         standards:
            o  Established governance standards and guidelines.
            o  Full board composed of not less than two-thirds "independent"
               directors, as defined by applicable regulatory and listing
               standards.
            o  Compensation, as well as audit and nominating (or corporate
               governance) committees composed entirely of independent
               directors.
            o  A designated or rotating presiding independent director appointed
               by and from the independent directors with the authority and
               responsibility to call and preside at regularly and, as
               necessary, specially scheduled meetings of the independent
               directors to be conducted, unless the participating independent
               directors otherwise wish, in executive session with no members of
               management present.
            o  Disclosed processes for communicating with any individual
               director, the presiding independent director (or, alternatively,
               all of the independent directors, as a group) and the entire
               board of directors, as a group.
            o  The pertinent class of the Company's voting securities has
               out-performed, on a three-year basis, both an appropriate peer
               group and benchmark index, as indicated in the performance
               summary table of the Company's proxy materials. This requirement
               shall not apply if there has been a change in the Chairman/CEO
               position within the three-year period.

     o   Proposals that grant or restore shareholder ability to remove directors
         with or without cause.

     o   Proposals to permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board
         vacancies.

     o   Proposals that encourage directors to own a minimum amount of company
         stock.

     o   Proposals to provide or to restore shareholder appraisal rights.

     o   Proposals to adopt cumulative voting.

     o   Proposals for the company to adopt confidential voting.


CMA generally will vote AGAINST:

     o   Proposals to classify boards, absent special circumstances indicating
         that shareholder interests would be better served by a classified board
         structure.

     o   Proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the
         board without shareholder approval.

     o   Proposals that provide directors may be removed only by supermajority
         vote.

     o   Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.

     o   Proposals which allow more than one vote per share in the election of
         directors.

     o   Proposals that provide that only continuing directors may elect
         replacements to fill board vacancies.

     o   Proposals that mandate a minimum amount of company stock that directors
         must own.

     o   Proposals to limit the tenure of non-management directors.


CMA will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis in contested elections of directors.

CMA generally will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis on board approved proposals
relating to corporate

governance. Such proposals include, but are not limited to:

     o   Director and officer indemnification and liability protection. CMA is
         opposed to entirely eliminating directors' and officers' liability for
         monetary damages for violating the duty of care. CMA is also opposed to
         expanding coverage beyond just legal expenses to acts, such as
         negligence, that are more serious violations of fiduciary obligation
         than mere carelessness. CMA supports proposals which provide such
         expanded coverage in cases when a director's or officer's legal defense
         was unsuccessful if: (i) the director was found to have acted in good
         faith and in a manner that he/she reasonably believed was in the best
         interests of the company, AND (ii) if the director's legal expenses
         would be covered.

     o   Reimbursement of proxy solicitation expenses taking into consideration
         whether or not CMA was in favor of the dissidents.

     o   Proxy contest advance notice. CMA generally will vote FOR proposals
         that allow shareholders to submit proposals as close to the meeting
         date as possible while allowing for sufficient time for Company
         response, SEC review, and analysis by other shareholders.


2. Compensation
- ---------------

CMA generally will vote FOR management sponsored compensation plans (such as
bonus plans, incentive plans, stock option plans, pension and retirement
benefits, stock purchase plans or thrift plans) if they are consistent with
industry and country standards. However, CMA generally is opposed to
compensation plans that substantially dilute ownership interest in a company,
provide participants with excessive awards, or have objectionable structural
features. Specifically, for equity-based plans, if the proposed number of shares
authorized for option programs (excluding authorized shares for expired options)
exceeds an average of 10% of the currently outstanding shares over the previous
three years or an average of 3% over the previous three years for directors
only, the proposal should be referred to the Proxy Committee. The Committee will
then consider the circumstances surrounding the issue and vote in the best
interest of CMA's clients. CMA requires that management provide substantial
justification for the repricing of options.

CMA generally will vote FOR:

     o   Proposals requiring that executive severance arrangements be submitted
         for shareholder ratification.

     o   Proposals asking a company to expense stock options.

     o   Proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

     o   Employee stock purchase plans that have the following features: (i) the
         shares purchased under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of
         their market value, (ii) the offering period under the plan is 27
         months or less, and (iii) dilution is 10% or less.


CMA generally will vote AGAINST:

     o   Stock option plans that permit issuance of options with an exercise
         price below the stock's current market price, or that permit replacing
         or repricing of out-of-the money options.
     o   Proposals to authorize the replacement or repricing of out-of-the money
         options.


CMA will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis proposals regarding approval of specific
executive severance arrangements.


3. Capitalization
- -----------------

CMA generally will vote FOR:

     o   Proposals to increase the authorized shares for stock dividends, stock
         splits (and reverse stock splits) or general issuance, unless proposed
         as an anti-takeover measure or the proposal increases the authorization
         by more than 30% without a clear need presented by the company.
         Proposals for reverse stock splits should include an overall reduction
         in authorization.

<PAGE>

         For companies recognizing preemptive rights for existing shareholders,
         CMA generally will vote FOR general issuance proposals that increase
         the authorized shares by more than 30%. CMA will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE
         basis all such proposals by companies that do not recognize preemptive
         rights for existing shareholders.

o        Proposals for the elimination of authorized but unissued shares or
         retirement of those shares purchased for sinking fund or treasury
         stock.

o        Proposals to institute/renew open market share repurchase plans in
         which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

o        Proposals to reduce or change the par value of common stock, provided
         the number of shares is also changed in order to keep the capital
         unchanged.


4. Mergers, Restructurings and Other Transactions
   ----------------------------------------------

CMA will review, on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, business transactions such as mergers,
acquisitions, reorganizations, liquidations, spinoffs, buyouts and sale of all
or substantially all of a company's assets.

5. Anti-Takeover Measures
   ----------------------

CMA generally will vote AGAINST proposals intended largely to avoid acquisition
prior to the occurrence of an actual event or to discourage acquisition by
creating a cost constraint. With respect to the following measures, CMA
generally will vote as follows:

Poison Pills

     o   CMA votes FOR shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its
         poison pill for shareholder ratification.

     o   CMA generally votes FOR shareholder proposals to eliminate a poison
         pill.

     o   CMA generally votes AGAINST management proposals to ratify a poison
         pill.


Greenmail

     o   CMA will vote FOR proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw
         amendments or to otherwise restrict a company's ability to make
         greenmail payments.


Supermajority vote

     o   CMA will vote AGAINST board-approved proposals to adopt anti-takeover
         measures such as supermajority voting provisions, issuance of blank
         check preferred stock, the creation of a separate class of stock with
         disparate voting rights and charter amendments adopting control share
         acquisition provisions.


Control Share Acquisition Provisions

     o   CMA will vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share acquisition
         statutes.


6. Other Business Matters
   ----------------------

CMA generally will vote FOR:

     o   Proposals to approve routine business matters such as changing the
         company's name and procedural matters relating to the shareholder
         meeting such as approving the minutes of a prior meeting.

     o   Proposals to ratify the appointment of auditors, unless any of the
         following apply in which case CMA will generally vote AGAINST the
         proposal:

<PAGE>

            o  Credible reason exists to question:
                  |X|    The auditor's independence, as determined by applicable
                         regulatory requirements.
                  |X|    The accuracy or reliability of the auditor's opinion as
                         to the company's financial position.
            o  Fees paid to the auditor or its affiliates for "non-audit"
               services were excessive, i.e., in excess of the total fees paid
               for "audit," "audit-related" and "tax compliance" and/or "tax
               return preparation" services, as disclosed in the company's proxy
               materials.

     o   Bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (e.g.,
         updates or corrections).

     o   Proposals to approve the annual reports and accounts provided the
         certifications required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have been
         provided.


CMA generally will vote AGAINST:

     o   Proposals to eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written
         consent or call special meetings.

     o   Proposals providing management with authority to adjourn an annual or
         special shareholder meeting absent compelling reasons, or to adopt,
         amend or repeal bylaws without shareholder approval, or to vote
         unmarked proxies in favor of management.

     o   Shareholder proposals to change the date, time or location of the
         company's annual meeting of shareholders.


CMA will vote AGAINST:

     o   Authorization to transact other unidentified substantive (as opposed to
         procedural) business at a meeting.


CMA will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis:

         o  Proposals to change the location of the company's state of
            incorporation. CMA considers whether financial benefits (e.g.,
            reduced fees or taxes) likely to accrue to the company as a result
            of a reincorporation or other change of domicile outweigh any
            accompanying material diminution of shareholder rights.

         o  Proposals on whether and how to vote on "bundled" or otherwise
            conditioned proposals, depending on the overall economic effects
            upon shareholders.

CMA generally will ABSTAIN from voting on shareholder proposals predominantly
involving social, socio-economic, environmental, political or other similar
matters on the basis that their impact on share value can rarely be anticipated
with any high degree of confidence. CMA may, on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, vote:

         o  FOR proposals seeking inquiry and reporting with respect to, rather
            than cessation or affirmative implementation of, specific policies
            where the pertinent issue warrants separate communication to
            shareholders; and

         o  FOR or AGAINST the latter sort of proposal in light of the relative
            benefits and detriments (e.g. distraction, costs, other burdens) to
            share value which may be expected to flow from passage of the
            proposal.

7. Investment Company Matters

CMA will vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis proposals for the election of directors,
considering the following factors:

CMA will WITHHOLD votes from directors who:
<PAGE>

     o   Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without
         a valid excuse for the absences. Valid reasons include illness or
         absence due to company business. Participation via telephone is
         acceptable. In addition, if the director missed only one meeting or one
         day's meetings, votes should not be withheld even if such absence
         dropped the director's attendance below 75 percent.
     o   Ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of shares
         outstanding;
     o   Ignore a shareholder proposal this is approved by a majority of the
         votes cast for two consecutive years;
     o   Are interested directors and sit on the audit or nominating committee;
         or

not fundamentally alter the investment focus of the fund and do comply with

CMA will vote FOR:
     o   Proposals allowing the Board to impose, without shareholder approval,
         fees payable upon redemption of fund shares, provided imposition of
         such fees is likely to benefit long-term fund investors (e.g., by
         deterring market timing activity by other fund investors)
     o   Proposals enabling the Board to amend, without shareholder approval,

            -------------------

B. ABILITY TO VOTE PROXIES OTHER THAN AS PROVIDED IN A ABOVE.

A Portfolio Manager, sub-adviser or other party involved with a client's account
may conclude that the best interest of the firm's client, as defined above,
requires that a proxy be voted in a manner that differs from the predetermined
proxy Voting Guidelines stated in Section IV.A. In this situation, he or she
shall request that the Proxy Committee consider voting the proxy other than
according such Guidelines. If any person, group,or entity requests the Proxy
Committee (or any of its members) vote a proxy other than according to the
predetermined Voting Guidelines, that person shall furnish to the Proxy
Committee a written explanation of the reasons for the request and a description
of the person's, group's, or entity's relationship, if any, with the parties
proposing and/or opposing the matter's adoption.

C. PROPOSALS REQUIRING SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

The following proposals require special, individual consideration. The Proxy
Committee will determine how proxies related to all such proposals will be
voted.

                  1. NEW PROPOSALS. For each new type of proposal that is
                  expected to be proposed to shareholders of multiple companies,
                  the Proxy Committee will develop a Voting Guideline which will
                  be incorporated into this Policy.

                  2. ACCOUNTS ADHERING TO TAFT HARTLEY PRINCIPLES. All proposals
                  for these accounts shall be voted according to the Taft
                  Hartley Guidelines developed by Institutional Shareholder
                  Services, Inc. ("ISS").

                  3. ACCOUNTS ADHERING TO SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PRINCIPLES. All
                  proposals for these accounts shall be voted according to the
                  Socially Responsible Guidelines developed by ISS or as
                  specified by the client.

                  4. PROXIES OF INTERNATIONAL ISSUERS WHICH BLOCK SECURITIES
                  SALES BETWEEN THE TIME A SHAREHOLDER SUBMITS A PROXY AND THE
                  VOTE. Proposals for these securities shall be voted only on
                  the specific instruction of the Proxy Committee and to the
                  extent practicable in accordance with the Voting Guidelines
                  set forth in this Policy.

                  5. PROXIES OF INVESTMENT COMPANY SHARES. Proposals on issues
                  other than those specified in Section IV.A.

                  6. EXECUTIVE/DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. Except as provided in
                  Section IV.A, proposals relating to compensation of any
                  executive or director will be voted as recommended by ISS or
                  as otherwise directed by the Proxy Committee.

                  7. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS. Proposals to create or eliminate
                  shareholder preemptive rights. In evaluating these proposals
                  the Proxy Committee will consider the size of the company and
                  the nature of its shareholder base.

<PAGE>

V. VOTING PROCEDURES

The Proxy Committee has developed the following procedures to aid the voting of
proxies according to the Voting Guidelines set forth in Section IV above. The
Proxy Committee may revise these procedures from time to time, as it deems
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of this Policy.

     o   CMA shall use an independent, third-party vendor (currently
         Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS")), to implement its proxy
         voting process as CMAs proxy voting agent. This retention is subject to
         CMA continuously assessing the vendor's independence from CMA and its
         affiliates, and the vendor's ability to perform its responsibilities
         (and, especially, its responsibility to vote client proxies in
         accordance with CMA's proxy voting guidelines) free of any actual,
         potential or apparent material conflicts of interests that may arise
         between the interests of the vendor, its affiliates, the vendor's other
         clients and the owners, officers or employees of any such firm, on the
         one hand, and CMA's clients, on the other hand. As means of performing
         this assessment, CMA will require various reports and notices from the
         vendor, as well as periodic audits of the vendor's voting record and
         other due diligence.

     o   ISS shall provide proxy analysis and record keeping services in
         addition to voting proxies on behalf of CMA in accordance with this
         Policy.

     o   On a daily basis CMA shall send to ISS a holdings file detailing each
         equity holding held in all accounts over which CMA has voting
         authority. Information regarding equity holdings for international
         portfolio shall be sent weekly.

     o   ISS shall receive proxy material information from Proxy Edge or the
         custodian bank for the account. This shall include issues to be voted
         upon, together with a breakdown of holdings for CMA accounts. ISS shall
         then reconcile information it receives from CMA with that it has
         received from Proxy Edge and custodian banks. Any discrepancies shall
         be promptly noted and resolved by ISS, with notice to CMA.

     o   Whenever a vote is solicited, ISS shall execute the vote according to
         CMA's Voting Guidelines previously delivered by CMA to ISS as set forth
         in Section IV.A.

         o  If ISS is not sure how to vote a particular proxy, then ISS will
            issue a request for voting instructions to CMA over a secure
            website. CMA personnel shall check this website regularly. The
            request shall be accompanied by a recommended vote. The recommended
            vote shall be based upon CMA's understanding of the Voting
            Guidelines previously delivered to ISS. CMA shall promptly provide
            ISS with any amendments or modifications to the Voting Guidelines if
            necessary. CMA shall return a final instruction to vote to ISS,
            which ISS shall record with Proxy Edge or the custodian bank as our
            agent.

     o   Each time that ISS shall send CMA a request to vote the request shall
         be accompanied by the recommended vote determined in accordance with
         CMA's Voting Guidelines. ISS shall vote as indicated in the request
         unless the client has reserved discretion, the Proxy Committee
         determines that the best interest of clients requires another vote or
         the proposal is a matter as to which the Proxy Committee affords
         special, individual consideration under Section IV.C. In such
         situations ISS shall vote based on the direction of the client or the
         Proxy Committee, as the case may be. The interests of CMA's Taft
         Hartley or Socially Responsible clients may impact a proposal that
         normally should be voted in a certain way. ISS shall inform CMA of all
         proposals having impact on its Taft Hartley and or Socially Responsible
         clients. The Proxy Voting Committee shall be consulted before a vote is
         placed in cases where Taft Hartley or Socially Responsible issues are
         presented.

     o   ISS shall have procedures in place to ensure that a vote is cast on
         every security holding maintained by CMA on which a vote is solicited
         unless otherwise directed by the Proxy Committee. On a yearly basis, or
         as required by our clients CMA shall receive a report from ISS
         detailing CMA's voting for the previous period.

                                                                  EX-99.CODE ETH


                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code") governs the investment companies within
the Nations Funds complex (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") as set
forth in Exhibit A. It applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or Controller and any other
persons conducting similar functions for the Funds (the "Covered Officers") as
set forth in Exhibit B. This Code promotes:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the
         Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
         communications made by the Funds;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to both actual
and apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
     OF INTEREST.

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal
interest interferes with the interest of, or his service to, the Funds. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Funds.

     Certain provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisors
Act") govern certain conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships
<PAGE>

between Covered Officers and the Funds. If such conflicts are addressed in
conformity with applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, they will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with
the Funds because they are "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The Funds' and
their investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conduct that is consistent with such programs and procedures falls
outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationships
between the Funds and the investment adviser, distributor and/or administrator
of which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees (each, a "Primary
Service Provider"). As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers
will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Funds or
for the Primary Service Providers, or for both), be involved in establishing
policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on the
Primary Service Providers and the Funds. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationships between
the Funds and the Primary Service Providers and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Funds. If
such conflicts are addressed in conformity with applicable provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, they will be deemed to
have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Boards of
Trustees and Directors (such Trustees and Directors collectively, "Trustees")
that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by other similar codes of ethics and that the codes
of ethics of those investment companies will apply to the Covered Officers
acting in those distinct capacities for those other investment companies.

     This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to provisions
in the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The overarching
principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be
placed improperly before the interest of the Funds. Certain examples of such
conflicts of interest follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o   not knowingly use his personal influence or personal relationships
         improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by
         the Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
         detriment of the Funds;
<PAGE>

     o   not knowingly cause the Funds to take action, or fail to take action,
         for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
         the benefit the Funds;

     o   not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
         contemplated for the Funds to trade personally or cause others to trade
         personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;
         and


     o   report at least annually known affiliations or other relationships that
         may give rise to conflicts of interest with respect to the Funds.

     If a Covered Officer believes that he has a potential conflict of interest
that is likely to materially compromise his objectivity or his ability to
perform the duties of his role as Covered Officer, including a potential
conflict of interest that arises out of his responsibilities as an officer or
employee of one or more Primary Service Providers or other funds, he should
consult with the Funds' Chief Legal Officer ("Legal Counsel"), the Funds'
outside counsel, or counsel to the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of
the Funds as defined in the Investment Company Act ("Independent Trustees"), as
appropriate. Under appropriate circumstances, the Covered Officer should also
consider whether to present the matter to the Board or an appropriate committee
thereof.

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer include:

     o   service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
         service as a public official;

     o   the receipt of a non-nominal gift when the gift is in relation to doing
         business directly or indirectly with the Funds;

     o   the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Funds have
         current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
         business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place,
         and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     o   an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Funds' service providers, other than the Primary
         Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and
<PAGE>

     o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the Funds for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE & COMPLIANCE

It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     o   to familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements generally
         applicable to the Funds, as well as the business and financial
         operations of the Funds;


     o   to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
         misrepresent, facts about the Funds to others, whether within or
         outside the Funds, including to the Trustees and the Funds' auditors,
         and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o   to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult
         with other officers and employees of the Funds and the Primary Service
         Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
         understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file
         with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
         the Funds; and

     o   within his or her area of responsibility, to adhere to and promote
         compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
         laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer and annually
         thereafter, affirm in writing to the Funds' Boards of Trustees that he
         has received, read, and understands the Code on the attached form;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has reviewed and
         believes that he has complied with the requirements of the Code on the
         attached form;

     o   not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
         potential violations that are made in good faith; and
<PAGE>

     o   notify Legal Counsel, the Funds' outside counsel, or counsel to the
         Independent Trustees promptly if he knows of any violation of this
         Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     Legal Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations
in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret
this Code in any particular situation. However, any approvals or waivers sought
by Covered Officers will be considered by the appropriate Audit Committee. Legal
Counsel is authorized and encouraged to consult, as appropriate, with the chair
of the Audit Committee, the Funds' outside counsel or counsel to the Independent
Trustees.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
     Code:

     o   Legal Counsel will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
         investigate any potential violations reported to him;

     o   if, after such investigation, Legal Counsel believes that no violation
         has occurred, Legal Counsel is not required to take any further action;

     o   any matter that Legal Counsel believes is a violation will be reported
         to the appropriate Audit Committee;

     o   if the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
         inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider
         appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
         modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
         appropriate personnel of the Funds' Primary Service Providers or their
         boards; a recommendation to censure, suspend or dismiss the Covered
         Officer or referral to of the matter to the appropriate authorities for
         civil action or criminal prosecution;

     o   the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as
         appropriate; and

     o   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
<PAGE>

policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' Primary Service Providers, or
other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities
of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by
this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of
this Code and this Code does not address the overlap or conflict. The Funds' and
their investment adviser's and investment sub-advisers' and principal
underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and the adviser's more detailed policies and procedures set forth in its
Compliance Manual are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Except as to Exhibit A, this Code may not be amended except in written
form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the
Funds' board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code or upon advice of
counsel, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Board and their counsel,the Primary Service Providers or their
affiliates and counsel and, if deemed appropriate, the Boards of the other
Funds.


VIII. RECORDKEEPING

     The Funds will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an easily
accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the Board:
(i) that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver to this Code, and (ii)
relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions imposed for such violation,
together with a written record of the approval or action taken by the Audit
Committee and/or Board.

IX.  INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
