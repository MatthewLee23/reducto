CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds for the 12 months ended October 31,
2006. The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds'
investments, and their audited financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
exempt from regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific fund, a high
level of current income exempt from that state's personal income taxes (and in
the case of the New York Fund, New York City personal income tax).

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds because our experience and
research indicate strongly that this maturity range has historically offered the
best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds--with less volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ PETER SUNDMAN

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS PORTFOLIO COMMENTARIES

Mixed economic signals and uncertainty regarding future Federal Reserve monetary
policy decisions restrained bond returns in the first half of the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2006. However, as investors saw more evidence that the economy
was beginning to decelerate and gained confidence that the extended Federal
Reserve tightening cycle was nearing an end, fixed income markets firmed. The
Fed's August 8 decision to leave the Fed Funds Rate unchanged at 5.25% (a
neutral posture that has remained intact through subsequent Fed meetings)
contributed to a bond market rally that resulted in respectable returns for the
fiscal year.

We are pleased to report that on a net asset value (NAV) basis, all three of
Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds posted healthy gains
and materially outperformed the Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index for the
fiscal year.

Throughout the year, the Funds' weighted average maturities and durations were
maintained in a narrow range reflecting our modestly bullish posture. Sector
allocations remained heavily weighted in advantageously priced revenue bonds.
During the first half of the fiscal year, our high credit quality standards
restrained relative returns as lower rated bonds outperformed. However, credit
quality did not have a material impact on relative returns in the second half.
And with today's historically tight credit spreads (or a minimal yield
differential between higher and lower rated bonds), there is even less incentive
to sacrifice quality for yield. In fact, we think that the credit risk of some
lower rated bonds has increased substantially. For example, real estate
developments financed partially through the issuance of municipal debt (in the
lingo of municipal bond investors, "dirt deals") may be especially risky in view
of the current housing market slump.

Although investors' perspective has changed since the beginning of last year,
all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve. The questions DU JOUR are now "How long
will the Fed maintain a neutral posture?" and "Is the next move to hike or cut
rates?" Following the announcement of surprisingly weak 1.6% third quarter GDP
growth (later revised up to 2.2%) and a chorus of bad news from homebuilding
companies, the bond market seemed to be pricing in anticipation of a Fed rate
cut in first quarter 2007. Then, much better-than-anticipated third quarter
corporate profits and a strong October jobs report led economists and market
strategists to not only question whether the Fed might begin easing interest
rates, but also to consider whether there could actually be one or two more rate
hikes in the offing. With today's flat yield curve providing no financial
incentive to lengthen the Funds' weighted average maturities or durations, we
will likely maintain the portfolios' current interest rate exposure until we see
a clearer direction for the economy and the Fed.

Our outlook for the municipal securities market remains largely constructive.
There are some potholes in the market in the form of municipal entities
suffering financial stress due to underfunded pension plans and/or rising health
care costs. That's why our internal credit analysis remains critical. However,
in general, we believe that municipal balance sheets are strong enough to
accommodate any decrease in revenues resulting from a slower growth economy or
even a mild recession. Most importantly, municipal bond yields still provide a
meaningful return advantage for investors in high federal income tax brackets.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

(+)       Investments in securities by Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
          Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate
          Municipal Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York
          Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund",
          and collectively, the "Funds") are valued daily by obtaining bid price
          quotations from independent pricing services on all securities
          available in each service's data base. For all other securities, bid
          prices are obtained from principal market makers in those securities
          or, if quotations are not readily available, by methods each Fund's
          Board of Directors has approved on the belief that they reflect fair
          value. Numerous factors may be considered when determining the fair
          value of a security, including available analyst, media or other
          reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer of the
          security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
          Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may
          be valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned,
          approximates market value.

##        At October 31, 2006, selected Fund information on a U.S. federal
          income tax basis was as follows:

                                       GROSS          GROSS            NET

CALIFORNIA           $153,312      $ 5,589          $ --        $ 5,589
INTERMEDIATE          468,543       16,264           166         16,098
NEW YORK              125,079        3,583           181          3,402

@         At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
          within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least
          80% of total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical
          rating organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
          Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not
          rated, are determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of
          comparable quality. Approximately 81%, 69%, and 58% of the municipal
          securities held by California, Intermediate, and New York,
          respectively, have credit enhancement features backing them, which the
          Funds may rely on, such as letters of credit, insurance, or
          guarantees. Without these credit enhancement features the securities
          may or may not meet the quality standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded
          bonds are supported by securities in escrow issued or guaranteed by
          the U.S. Government, its agencies, or instrumentalities. The amount
          escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic interest due and the
          principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds the right to
          sell back the issue on the date specified.

~         Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

^         Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
          securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt
          from registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under
          Rule 144A and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid.
          At October 31, 2006, these securities amounted to $4,482,000 or 1.5%
          of net assets applicable to common shareholders for Intermediate.

^^        Not rated by a NRSRO.

*         All or a portion of this security was purchased on a when-issued
          basis. At October 31, 2006, these securities amounted to $2,966,000 or
          .96% of net assets for Intermediate.

**        All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for
          when-issued purchase commitments.

#         Floating rate securities are securities whose yields vary with a
          designated market index or market rate. These securities are shown at
          their current rates as of October 31, 2006.

@@        Credit ratings are unaudited.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
     ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds")
     were organized as Maryland corporations on July 29, 2002. California and
     New York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end management
     investment companies and Intermediate is registered as a diversified,
     closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act
     of 1940, as amended. Each Fund's Board of Directors may classify or
     re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes
     of preferred stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The assets of each Fund belong only to that Fund, and the liabilities of
     each Fund are borne solely by that Fund and no other.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on trade date for financial reporting purposes. Interest income,
     including accretion of discount (adjusted for original issue discount,
     where applicable) and amortization of premium, where applicable, is
     recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities
     transactions are recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated in the
     Statements of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for U.S.
     federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to continue to
     qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
     requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
     regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
     earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
     provision is required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by each Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by each Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2006, there were no permanent differences
     resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at fiscal
     year-end.

</TABLE>

     The differences between book basis and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments.

     To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset
     by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
     distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2006, the Funds had
     unused capital loss carryforwards available for federal income tax purposes

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to declare
     quarterly and pay monthly distributions. Distributions from net realized
     capital gains, if any, are normally distributed in December. Distributions
     to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions to
     preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     Subsequent to October 31, 2006, each Fund declared three monthly
     distributions to common shareholders payable December 15, 2006, January 16,
     2007 and February 15, 2007 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2006,

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund. Expenses
     borne by the complex of related investment companies, which includes
     open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management serves as
     investment manager, that are not directly attributed to a Fund are
     allocated among the Funds and the other investment companies in the complex
     or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
     appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
     unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
     Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), as follows:

     On December 13, 2002, the Funds issued several series of AMPS, as follows:

     All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
     per share plus any accumulated unpaid distributions, whether or not earned
     or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation
     Value"). Distributions to AMPS shareholders, which are cumulative, are
     accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay distributions every 7
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS
     Series B, unless in a special rate period.

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an auction.
     For the year ended October 31, 2006, distribution rates ranged from:

                                                               DISTRIBUTION RATE

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     28 days for each Fund's AMPS Series B, based on the results of an auction.
     For the year ended October 31, 2006, distribution rates ranged from:

     The Funds declared distributions to AMPS shareholders for the period
     November 1, 2006 to November 30, 2006, for each series of the AMPS as
     follows:

                                               SERIES A SHARES   SERIES B SHARES
CALIFORNIA                                         $ 72,413         $ 82,404
INTERMEDIATE                                        258,346          261,113
NEW YORK                                             66,302           64,842

     The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part, on
     the second business day preceding any distribution payment date at
     Liquidation Value.

     The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value.

     The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or a Fund's
     charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
     entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a
     majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions
     on AMPS for two consecutive years.

8    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
     held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
     developments, including those particular to a specific industry or region.
     California and New York normally invest substantially all of their assets
     in municipal bonds of issuers located in the state of California and the
     state of New York, respectively. The value of the Funds securities are more
     susceptible to adverse economic, political, regulatory or other factors
     affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds than a fund that does not
     limit its investments to such issuers.

9    INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
     documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal service contracts and
     in the normal course of their business, the Funds enter into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against each Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
     rates:

                               2011             0.05

     Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
     31, 2011.

     For the year ended October 31, 2006, such waived fees amounted to $397,685,
     $1,208,640, and $322,194 for California, Intermediate, and New York,
     respectively.

     Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the
     New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to each Fund, are wholly-owned
     subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned holding
     company. Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with investment
     recommendations and research information without added cost to each Fund.
     Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each Fund are also
     employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

     Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
     custodian contract. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $2,106, $4,763, and $2,534 for
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that each
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require each Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. Each Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report which is reflected in the
     Statements of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     NOTE E--RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
     Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions
     should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
     statements. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by
     prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to
     meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
     that a "more-likely-than-not" threshold be met before the benefit of a tax
     position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how
     such benefit should be measured. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal
     years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
     tax years as of the effective date. At this time, Management is evaluating
     the implications of FIN 48 and its impact in the financial statements has
     not yet been determined.

     In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value
     Measurement" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a
     framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
     value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
     November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
     Management believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material
     impact on the financial positions or results of operations.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results
     represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current
     returns may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment
     returns may fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than
     original cost. For each Fund, total return would have been lower if
     Management had not waived the investment management fee.

     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc. (the "Funds"), including the schedules of investments, as of
October 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc., and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., at October 31, 2006, the results of their operations for
the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and their financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN CONT'D

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

MARYLAND ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES

By resolution of the Board of Directors, each Fund has opted into the Maryland
Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. In
general, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control
shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition may
not be voted except to the extent approved by shareholders at a special meeting
by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter
(excluding shares owned by the acquiror and by officers or directors who are
employees of the corporation). "Control shares" are voting shares of stock
which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in
respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of
voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the
acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within certain
statutorily-defined ranges (one-tenth but less than one-third, one-third but
less than a majority, and more than a majority of the voting power). In general,
the Maryland Business Combination Act prohibits an interested shareholder (a
shareholder that holds 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock
of the corporation) of a Maryland corporation from engaging in a business
combination (generally defined to include a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, sale of a substantial amount of assets, a transfer of the
corporation's securities and similar transactions to or with the interested
shareholder or an entity affiliated with the interested shareholder) with the
corporation for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the
interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. No Fund is aware of any
shareholder that holds control shares or that is an interested shareholder under
the statutes.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting held on September 27, 2006, the Boards of Directors (collectively
the "Boards," each a "Board") of Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. and
Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. (each a "Fund"),
including the Directors who are not "interested persons" of each Fund
("Independent Fund Directors"), approved continuance of the Management and
Sub-Advisory Agreements ("Agreements") for each Fund.

In evaluating the Agreements, the Boards, including the Independent Fund
Directors, reviewed materials furnished by Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
("Management") and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger") in response to questions
submitted by counsel to the Independent Fund Directors, and met with senior
representatives of Management and Neuberger regarding their personnel and
operations. The Independent Fund Directors were advised by counsel that is
experienced in Investment Company Act of 1940 matters and that is independent of
Management and Neuberger. The Independent Fund Directors received a memorandum
from independent counsel discussing the legal standards for their consideration
of the proposed continuance of the Agreements. They met with such counsel
separately from representatives of Management to discuss the annual contract
review. The annual contract review extends over two regular meetings of the
Boards to ensure that Management and Neuberger have time to respond to any
questions the Independent Fund Directors may have on their initial review of the
report and that the Independent Fund Directors have time to consider those
responses. In addition, during this process, the Boards held a separate meeting
devoted to reviewing and discussing Fund performance.

Each Board considered the following factors, among others, in connection with
its approval of the continuance of the Agreements: (1) the nature, extent, and
quality of the services provided by Management and Neuberger; (2) the
performance of each Fund compared to relevant market indices and a peer group of
investment companies; (3) the costs of the services provided and profits
historically realized by Management and its affiliates from the relationship
with the Funds; (4) the extent to which economies of scale might be realized as
each Fund grows; and (5) whether fee levels reflect those potential economies of
scale for the benefit of investors in each Fund. In their deliberations, the
members of each Board did not identify any particular information that was
all-important or controlling, and each Director may have attributed different
weights to the various factors.

Each Board evaluated the terms of the Agreements and whether the Agreements were
in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders. Each Board considered,
with respect to each Fund, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided under the Agreements and the overall fairness of the Agreements to the
Funds.

With respect to the nature, extent and quality of the services provided, each
Board considered the performance of each Fund and the degree of risk undertaken
by the portfolio managers. The Boards considered the experience and staffing of
portfolio management and the investment research personnel of Management and
Neuberger dedicated to performing services for the Funds. The Boards noted that
Management also provides certain administrative services, including fund
accounting and compliance oversight. The Boards also considered Management's and
Neuberger's policies and practices regarding brokerage and allocation of
portfolio transactions for the Funds. The Boards also reviewed whether
Management and Neuberger used brokers to execute Fund transactions that provide
research and other services to Management and Neuberger, and the types of
benefits potentially derived by Management, Neuberger, the Funds and by other
clients of Management and Neuberger from such services. In addition, the Boards
noted the positive compliance history of Management and Neuberger, as each firm
has been free of significant compliance problems.

With respect to the performance of each Fund, each Board considered the
performance of each Fund on both a market return and net asset value basis
relative to its benchmark and a peer group of investment companies pursuing
broadly similar strategies. Each Board also considered the performance in
relation to the degree of risk undertaken by the portfolio managers. Each Board
discussed each Fund's performance with Management and discussed steps that
Management had taken, or intended to take, to improve each Fund's performance.
The Boards also considered Management's resources and responsiveness with
respect to each Fund.

With respect to the overall fairness of the Agreements, the Boards considered
the fee structure of the Agreements as compared to a peer group of comparable
funds and any fall-out benefits likely to accrue to Management or Neuberger or
their affiliates. The Boards also considered the profitability of Management and
its affiliates from their association with the Funds.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS CONT'D

The Boards reviewed a comparison of each Fund's management fee and overall
expense ratio to a peer group of comparable funds. Each Board considered the
mean and median of the management fees and expense ratios of the peer group.
With regard to the sub-advisory fee paid to Neuberger, the Boards noted that
this fee is reflective of an "at cost" basis and there is no profit to Neuberger
with regard to these fees. Each Board considered each Fund's overall expenses in
relation to the overall expenses of the peer group mean and median. In addition,
each Board considered the contractual waiver of a portion of the management fee
undertaken by Management for each Fund. For Neuberger Berman California
Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
Municipal Fund Inc., each Fund's respective Board noted that Management incurred
a loss on the Fund on an after-tax basis.

The Boards considered whether there were other funds that were sub-advised by
Management or its affiliates or separate accounts managed by Management with
similar investment objectives, policies and strategies as the Funds. The Boards
noted that there were no comparable sub-advised funds or separate accounts.

Each Board also evaluated any actual or anticipated economies of scale in
relation to the services Management provides to each Fund. The Boards considered
that each Fund was a closed-end fund that is not continuously offering shares
and that, without daily inflows and outflows of capital, there were not at this
time significant economies of scale to be realized by Management in managing
each Fund's assets.

In concluding that the benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by
virtue of their relationship to the Funds were reasonable in comparison with the
costs of providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to
each Fund, each Board reviewed specific data as to Management's profit or loss
on each Fund for a recent period and the trend in profit or loss over time. The
Boards also carefully examined Management's cost allocation methodology and had
an independent consultant review the methodology. It also reviewed an analysis
from an independent data service on investment management profitability margins.
The Boards recognized that Management should be entitled to earn a reasonable
level of profits for services it provides to the Funds and, based on its review,
concluded it was satisfied that Management's level of profitability from its
relationship with the Funds was not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

In approving the Agreements, each Board concluded that the terms of each
Agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the Agreements is in the
best interest of each Fund and its shareholders. In reaching this determination,
each Board considered that Management and Neuberger could be expected to provide
a high level of service to each Fund; that it retained confidence in
Management's and Neuberger's capabilities to manage the Funds; that each Fund's
fee structure appeared to each Board to be reasonable given the nature and
quality of services expected to be provided; and that the benefits accruing to
Management and its affiliates by virtue of their relationship to the Funds were
reasonable in comparison with the costs of providing the investment advisory
services and the benefits accruing to each Fund.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The  complete  schedule  of  investments  for each  series is  disclosed  in the
Registrant's Annual Report, which is included as Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility   to  vote  proxies   related  to  the  securities  held  in  the
Registrant's  portfolio.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by
the Board to vote proxies related to portfolio  securities in the best interests
of the Registrant and its  stockholders.  The Board permits  Neuberger Berman to
contract  with a third  party to  obtain  proxy  voting  and  related  services,
including research of current issues.

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger Berman has voting  authority,  including the Registrant.  The
Proxy Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman addresses any conflicts
that may arise  between its  interests  and those of its clients with respect to
proxy voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

<PAGE>

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

(a)(1)   The   following   Portfolio   Managers   have   day-to-day   management

Conflicts of Interest
- ---------------------

Actual or apparent  conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio Manager has
day-to-day  management  responsibilities  with  respect to more than one fund or
other  account.  The  management  of  multiple  funds  and  accounts  (including
proprietary  accounts)  may give rise to potential  conflicts of interest if the
funds and  accounts  have  different  or similar  objectives,  benchmarks,  time

<PAGE>

horizons,  and  fees  as the  Portfolio  Manager  must  allocate  his  time  and
investment ideas across multiple funds and accounts.  The Portfolio  Manager may
execute  transactions  for another fund or account that may adversely impact the
value of securities held by the  Registrant.  Moreover,  if a Portfolio  Manager
identifies a limited  investment  opportunity that may be suitable for more than
one fund or other account, the Registrant may not be able to take full advantage
of that  opportunity.  Securities  selected for funds or accounts other than the
Registrant  may  outperform  the  securities  selected  for the  Registrant.  NB
Management,  Neuberger Berman and the Registrant have adopted certain compliance
procedures  which are  designed to address  these types of  conflicts.  However,
there is no guarantee that such  procedures will detect each and every situation
in which a conflict arises.

(a)(3) Compensation (as of October 31, 2006)
       ------------------------------------


A portion of the  compensation  paid to each Portfolio  Manager is determined by
comparisons to pre-determined peer groups and benchmarks, as opposed to a system
dependent on a percent of management  fees.  The  Portfolio  Managers are paid a
base salary that is not dependent on  performance.  Each Portfolio  Manager also
has a "target  bonus,"  which is set each year and can be increased or decreased
prior to payment based in part on performance measured against the relevant peer
group and benchmark.  Performance is measured on a three-year rolling average in
order to emphasize longer-term performance. There is also a subjective component
to  determining  the bonus,  which  consists of the following  factors:  (i) the
individual's  willingness to work with the marketing and sales groups;  (ii) his
or her effectiveness in building a franchise; and (iii) client servicing. Senior
management  determines this component in appropriate cases. There are additional
components  that  comprise  the  Portfolio  Managers'   compensation   packages,
including:  (i) whether the manager was a partner/principal  of Neuberger Berman
prior to Neuberger Berman Inc.'s initial public  offering;  (ii) for more recent
hires,  incentives  that  may have  been  negotiated  at the time the  Portfolio
Manager  joined the  Neuberger  Berman  complex;  and (iii) the total  amount of
assets for which the Portfolio Manager is responsible.


NB Management's Portfolio Managers have always had a degree of independence that
they would not get at other firms that have, for example, investment committees.
NB Management believes that its Portfolio Managers are retained not only through
compensation  and  opportunities  for  advancement,  but also by a collegial and
stable money management environment.


In addition, there are additional stock and option award programs available.


NB Management  believes the  measurement  versus the peer groups on a three-year
rolling average basis creates a meaningful disincentive to try and beat the peer
group  and  benchmark  in any  given  year by taking  undue  risks in  portfolio
management.  The incentive is to be a solid performer over the longer-term,  not
necessarily to be a short-term winner in any given year.

(a)(4) Ownership of Securities
       -----------------------

Set forth below is the dollar range of equity securities  beneficially  owned by
each Portfolio Manager in the Registrant as of October 31, 2006.

       Financial and Accounting  Officer of the  Registrant  have concluded that
       such  disclosure  controls and  procedures  are  effectively  designed to
       ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by the  Registrant  on
       Form  N-CSR  and  Form  N-Q  is  accumulated  and   communicated  to  the
       Registrant's  management  to allow timely  decisions  regarding  required
       disclosure.

       over financial reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
       occurred  during the  Registrant's  second  fiscal  quarter of the period
       covered by this report that have materially  affected  or  are reasonably
       likely to  materially  affect,  the  Registrant's  internal  control over
       financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

       Form N-CSR,  Investment Company Act file number 811-21168 (filed July 10,

(a)(2) The  certifications  required by Rule 30a-2(a) of the Act and Section 302
       of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  ("Sarbanes-Oxley  Act") are filed
       herewith.

(a)(3) Not applicable to the Registrant.

(b)    The  certifications  required by Rule 30a-2(b) of the Act and Section 906
       of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are filed herewith.

The certifications provided pursuant to Rule 30a-2(b) of the Act and Section 906
