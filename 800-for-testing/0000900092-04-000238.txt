Semi-Annual Report
June 30, 2004



Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide
shareholders with current income and capital appreciation. The
Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a
portfolio of equity and debt securities of U.S. and foreign issuers.

This report, including the financial information herein, is
transmitted to shareholders of Capital and Income Strategies Fund,
Inc. for their information. It is not a prospectus. The Fund
leverages its Common Stock to provide Common Stock shareholders with
a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risk for
Common Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater
volatility of net asset value and market price of Common Stock
shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates
may reduce the Common Stock's yield. Past performance results shown
in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. Statements and other information herein are as dated
and are subject to change.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to
determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through
borrowings or issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of
Preferred Stock. The concept of leveraging is based on the premise
that the cost of assets to be obtained from leverage will be based
on short-term interest or dividend rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term
portfolio investments. To the extent that the total assets of the
Fund (including the assets obtained from leverage) are invested in
higher-yielding portfolio investments, the Fund's Common Stock
shareholders are the beneficiaries of the incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the
likelihood of greater net asset value and market price volatility.
In addition, there is the risk that fluctuations in interest rates
on borrowings (or in the dividend rates on any Preferred Stock, if
the Fund were to issue the Preferred Stock) may reduce the Common
Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets
received from leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net
income will be greater than if leverage had not been used.
Conversely, if the income from the securities purchased is not
sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will
be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the amount
available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be
reduced.

A Letter From the President


Dear Shareholder

As we ended the current period, all eyes were on the Federal Reserve
Board (the Fed). In a much-anticipated move, the Fed raised the
Federal Funds rate on June 30 for the first time in four years,
bringing the target rate to 1.25%, up from a 45-year low of 1%. The
25 basis point (.25%) increase was the first, but is not expected to
be the last, this year as the Fed moves to "normalize" interest
rates in the face of increasing inflation. The Fed has reiterated
its intention to take a "measured" approach to interest rate
increases in an effort to avoid upsetting the economy or the
financial markets. Still, in its very deliberate wording, the Fed
has stated that it may move more aggressively if inflation and
economic growth indicate the need.

In any case, interest rates are likely to remain low by historical
standards for some time, particularly if the Fed does maintain its
commitment to a gradual tightening. To provide some perspective, the
Federal Funds rate was at 6.5% before the current easing cycle began
in 2001 and had reached double-digits in the late 1970s and early
1980s.

The transition to higher interest rates can cause concern among
equity and fixed income investors alike. As interest rates rise,
fixed income securities may become a more attractive investment
option and thereby pressure equity prices. Higher interest rates
also translate into increases in business costs, potentially cutting
into corporate profits. For bond investors, rising interest rates
means the value of older bonds declines because they carry the
former lower interest rates.

June month-end also brought the transfer of power in Iraq. Like
the Fed tightening, this was a pivotal event. However, the outcome
and the market repercussions are less easy to predict. We do know
that markets will always fluctuate and that there are many
uncertainties - including the possibility of geopolitical events -
that can translate into negative market movements. Still, many of
the world's economies are much stronger today than they were just
one year ago. With this in mind, we encourage you to revisit your
portfolio and your asset allocation strategy to ensure you are well
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.
Importantly, you should consult with your financial advisor, who can
help you assess the market and economic environment and then develop
a strategy most suitable for your circumstances and financial goals.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with
your investment assets, and we look forward to serving you in the
months and years ahead.



Sincerely,



(Terry K. Glenn)

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Managers


We are pleased to provide you with this first shareholder report for
Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. The Fund's objective is to
provide current income and capital appreciation.


What is the Fund's investment strategy?

The Fund invests in a portfolio of equity and debt securities of
U.S. and foreign issuers. From time to time, the Fund's investment
adviser may vary the Fund's asset allocation based on such factors
as market and economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, and
the relative security valuation and yield of the various debt and
equity asset classes. To enable the Fund to take advantage of this
flexible investment approach, the Fund may invest without limitation
in any type of equity or debt security and derivative, including
preferred securities or debt securities that are rated below
investment grade or, if unrated, are considered by the Fund's
investment adviser to be of comparable quality.


How has the Fund performed since its inception in light of the
existing market and economic conditions?

The Fund was introduced on April 30, 2004, in an environment
characterized by market volatility, interspersed with bright spots.
The market uncertainty was fueled by geopolitical factors, rising
oil prices and somewhat mixed economic data in the United States. On
June 30, 2004, the Federal Reserve Board raised its target rate .25%
to 1.25%. The Fed worked hard to telegraph its intentions well ahead
of its action. As a result, the hike had already been priced into
the stock and bond markets by the time the interest rate increase
occurred.

Since inception (April 30, 2004) through June 30, 2004, the total
investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +2.77%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $19.10 to $19.63. Until the
Fund's first quarterly dividend payment, which is scheduled for
September 9, 2004, the Fund has no quotable yield.

For the same period, the Fund's composite benchmark returned +.74%,*
while its comparable Lipper category of Income and Preferred Stock
Funds had an average return of +.47%. (Funds in this Lipper category
normally seek a high level of current income through investing in
income-producing stocks, bonds and money market instruments, or
funds in the category may invest primarily in preferred securities,
often considering tax-code implications.)


*The Fund's composite benchmark is a blend of the Merrill Lynch
Preferred Stock, DRD Eligible Index; the JP Morgan Emerging Markets
Bond Global Index; the Merrill Lynch 1 - 3 Year Corporate &
Government Index; and the Standard & Poor's 500 Barra Value Index.


Relative to our composite benchmark, the Fund's preferred securities
allocation drove most of the positive performance. This was largely
due to an underweight position in preferred securities in favor of
cash as we were making the Fund's initial investments in early May.
The preferred market was relatively weak at this time, therefore,
our underweighting was an advantage. Subsequently, the Fund was
better positioned to capture much of the rally that ensued in the
preferred market in mid May and June. The Fund also generated income
from its option (call-writing) program, whereby the Fund sold call
options on the Fund's common stock holdings. This is a strategy that
we are able to employ and have found particularly helpful during the
Fund's ramp-up phase. Essentially, the call-writing program
generates additional income, thereby helping the Fund to meet its
goal of providing shareholders with quarterly distributions at an
annualized rate of 6% of the initial public offering price per
share. The Fund's common stock and emerging market components
slightly underperformed their respective benchmarks for the period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a
change in the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as
measured by the trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York
Stock Exchange), and assuming reinvestment of dividends, please
refer to the Financial Highlights section included in this report.
As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a
result, total investment returns based on changes in the market
value of the Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total
investment returns based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.



CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC., JUNE 30, 2004



How has the Fund been managed since its inception?

The Fund was created with the following strategic allocation: 55%
equities, 30% preferred securities, 10% short-term investment grade
bonds, and 5% emerging market bonds. We have the flexibility to vary
the Fund's asset allocation from time to time based on market and
economic conditions or relative valuation and yield considerations
in our relevant markets. We initiated the Fund in May with a
tactical underweight relative to our composite benchmark in short-
term U.S. bonds and overweight in short-term emerging market bonds.
Thus, the Fund commenced operations with a 55% allocation in
equities, 30% in preferred securities, 5% in intermediate-term to
long-term emerging market bonds and 10% in short-term emerging
market bonds.

At June 30, 2004, the Fund was approximately 31% leveraged. For
a complete discussion of the benefits and risks of leverage, see
page 2 of this report to shareholders.


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the
period?

Despite strong first-quarter corporate earnings, expectations for
solid second-quarter earnings, and continuing acceleration in
worldwide economies, we remain concerned about several factors.
Specifically, the government of China is attempting to orchestrate a
slowdown in the nation's economy, which has been a vital catalyst
for global growth. In the United States, we are entering a period of
uncertainty in which the presidential election and geopolitical
events are weighing negatively on the markets. While we probably
have seen the high water mark for the economy, as measured by year-
over-year earnings growth, we do not believe this signals the end of
the stock market uptrend. Hence, we maintain our 55% allocation to
stocks, with a current bias toward dividend-paying stocks.

Generally speaking, we expect interest rates to rise and foresee a
continued favorable domestic and international credit environment.
In the preferred securities portfolio, our current duration position
is neutral relative to our benchmark. Duration is a measure of a
Fund's sensitivity to interest rate movements. Generally, the longer
an investment's duration, the more that investment's value will
fluctuate with increases in interest rates. Therefore, we believe a
neutral duration profile is prudent in a rising interest rate
environment.

On a sector basis, we continue to be heavily concentrated in the
financials and utility sectors. Such concentrations are consistent
with the preferred securities market, as utilities and financials
comprise more than 60% of the dividends received deduction (DRD)
market. (DRD is a tax benefit that allows a U.S. corporation to
exclude from taxable income 70% of dividends received from the
preferred stock of another U.S. company. The market for these
securities is referred to as the DRD market and is not accessible to
individual investors.) The average credit-rating quality of the
portfolio at period-end was Baa1.

In terms of emerging market investments, most of the risks going
forward are likely to be found in the global economy, global
interest rates, oil and commodity prices, and geopolitical factors.
If we were to see a rapid increase in global interest rates, it is
likely to occur in the context of a boom in world growth, in which
emerging market economies would be major beneficiaries. Such a
development would result in emerging market credit upgrades and
spread compression, which should offset the initial increase in U.S.
Treasury yields. This reaction seems logical from a historical
perspective, as there tends to be little medium-term statistical
correlation between U.S. Treasury yields and emerging market bond
returns. Based on this scenario, the Fund currently has an
overweight position in short-term emerging market bonds.

Finally, we plan to monitor market conditions in the months ahead in
order to evaluate the possibility of extending our call-writing
strategy. This would allow us to continue to generate income beyond
that which is provided by the portfolio's underlying investments,
thereby helping the Fund to meet its current managed distribution
rate.

CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC., JUNE 30, 2004



Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company. Prior to
commencement of operations on April 30, 2004, the Fund had no
operations other than those relating to organizational matters and
the sale of 5,236 shares of Common Stock on April 13, 2004 to Fund
Asset Management, L.P. ("FAM") for $100,008. The Fund's financial
statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which may require the use of management
accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
to present a fair statement of the results for the interim period.
All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Fund
determines and makes available for publication the net asset value
of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CII.
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments--Equity securities that are held by the
Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the Nasdaq National
Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price on
the exchange, as of the close of business on the day the securities
are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last available bid
price for long positions, and at the last available ask price for
short positions. In cases where equity securities are traded on more
than one exchange, the securities are valued on the exchange
designated as the primary market by or under the authority of the
Board of Directors of the Fund. Long positions traded in the over-
the-counter ("OTC") market, Nasdaq Small Cap or Bulletin Board are
valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board
of Directors of the Fund. Short positions traded in the OTC market
are valued at the last available ask price. Portfolio securities
that are traded both in the OTC market and on a stock exchange are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market.

Options written are valued at the last sale price in the case of
exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the OTC
market, the last ask price. Options purchased are valued at their
last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the
case of options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. Swap
agreements are valued daily based upon quotations from market
makers. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are
traded on exchanges, are valued at their last sale price as of the
close of such exchanges. Obligations with remaining maturities of
60 days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Investment
Adviser believes that this method no longer produces fair
valuations.

Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest. The
Fund employs pricing services to provide certain securities prices
for the Fund. Securities and assets for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of the
Fund, including valuations furnished by the pricing services
retained by the Fund, which may use a matrix system for valuations.
The procedures of a pricing service and its valuations are reviewed
by the officers of the Fund under the general supervision of the
Fund's Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. government
securities and money market instruments, is substantially completed
each day at various times prior to the close of business on the
NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the net asset
value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign
currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior to the
close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the
values of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between
the times at which they are determined and the close of business on
the NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's
net asset value. If events (for example, a company announcement,
market volatility or a natural disaster) occur during such periods
that are expected to materially affect the value of such securities,
those securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in
good faith by the Fund's Board of Directors or by the Investment
Adviser using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the
Fund's Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various
portfolio investment strategies both to increase the return of the
Fund and to hedge, or protect, its exposure to interest rate
movements and movements in the securities markets. Losses may arise
due to changes in the value of the contract or if the counterparty
does not perform under the contract.



CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC., JUNE 30, 2004



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


* Options--The Fund may write and purchase call and put options.
When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium
received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent
liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to
market to reflect the current market value of the option written.

When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or
deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
(or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option
expires (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund
realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums
received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell
financial futures contracts and options on such futures contracts.
Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities
at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon
entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and maintains as
collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on which
the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund
agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal
to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or
payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund
as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the
value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed.

* Swaps--The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are over-the-
counter contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make
periodic net payments on a specified notional amount. The net
payments can be made for a set period of time or may be triggered by
a predetermined credit event. The net periodic payments may be based
on a fixed or variable interest rate; the change in market value of
a specified security, basket of securities, or index; or the return
generated by a security.

(c) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security
transactions are recorded on the dates the transactions are entered
into (the trade dates). Realized gains and losses on security
transactions are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates. Interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all premiums and
discounts on debt securities.

(e) Offering expenses--Direct expenses relating to the public
offering of the Fund's Common Stock were charged to capital at the
time of issuance of the shares.

(f) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment
income are declared and paid quarterly, commencing in September
2004. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the ex-dividend
dates.

(g) Securities lending--The Fund may lend securities to financial
institutions that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by
the U.S. government as collateral, which will be maintained at all
times in an amount equal to at least 100% of the current market
value of the loaned securities. The market value of the loaned
securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and
any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the
next business day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral
for the loaned securities, it collects a fee from the borrower. The
Fund typically receives the income on the loaned securities but does
not receive the income on the collateral. Where the Fund receives
cash collateral it may invest such collateral and retain the amount
earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the
borrower. Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the
borrower, after notice, is required to return borrowed securities
within five business days. The Fund may pay reasonable finder's,
lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in connection with
its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its obligation
to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access
to the collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value
of the collateral falls below the market value of the borrowed
securities, in the event of borrower default or in the event of
losses on investments made with cash collateral.

CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC., JUNE 30, 2004



Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)


4. Capital Share Transactions:
The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of capital stock,
par value $.10, all of which were initially classified as Common
Stock. The Board of Directors is authorized, however, to reclassify
any unissued shares of capital stock without approval of holders of
Common Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding during the period April 30, 2004 to
June 30, 2004 increased 12,825,000 from shares sold.


5. Short-Term Borrowings:
On May 26, 2004, the Fund entered into a $135,000,000 revolving
credit and security agreement with Citibank, N.A. and other lenders
(the "Lenders"). Under the revolving credit and security agreement,
the Fund may borrow money through (i) a line of credit from certain
Lenders at the eurodollar rate plus .75% or the highest of the
Federal Funds rate plus .50%, a base rate as determined by Citibank,
N.A. and/or the latest three-week moving average of secondary market
morning offering rates in the United States for three-month
certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks plus .50%,
or (ii) the issuance of commercial paper notes by certain Lenders at
rates of interest based upon the weighted average of the per annum
rates paid or payable by such Lenders in respect of those commercial
paper notes. As security for its obligations to the Lenders under
the revolving credit and security agreement, the Fund has granted a
security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor
of the Lenders. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs which
include a commitment fee for this facility at the annual rate of
..10% and a program fee of .24% on the borrowings outstanding.

For the period April 30, 2004 to June 30, 2004, the average amount
borrowed was approximately $68,661,000 and the daily weighted
average interest rate was 1.38%.

CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC., JUNE 30, 2004



Managed Distribution Policy


The Fund has adopted a policy of paying regular distributions on its
Common Stock (the "Managed Distribution Policy"). The Fund's Board
of Directors has initially determined to pay quarterly distributions
at an annualized rate of 6% of the initial public offering price per
share ($.30 per share, per quarter). The Fund's Board of Directors
has determined to pay additional distributions on an annual basis
equal to any income earned by the Fund in excess of the quarterly
distributions as may be necessary to distribute substantially all of
the Fund's net investment company taxable income for that year.

The Fund generally is not permitted to distribute net realized long-
term capital gains more than once per year without exemptive relief
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the Fund
has applied for an exemption that will permit the Fund to make
periodic distributions of realized long-term capital gains to its
stockholders. Until such time, if any, as the exemptive relief is
granted, the Fund intends to make distributions from its net
investment income on a quarterly basis and from its net realized
long term capital gains, if any, on an annual basis. If such
exemptive relief is granted, the Fund intends to make distributions
from its net investment income and its realized long term capital
gains, if any, on a quarterly basis.

If the total distributions paid by the Fund to its stockholders for
any calendar year exceed the Fund's net investment company taxable
income and net realized capital gain for that year, the excess will
generally be treated as a tax-free return of capital up to the
amount of a shareholder's tax basis in his or her stock. Any
distributions that constitute tax-free return of capital will reduce
a stockholder's tax basis in his or her stock. In effect, a return
of capital is the return of a stockholder's investment in the Fund
and will result in a corresponding decline in the Fund's net asset
value. Return of capital distributions also may have the effect of
increasing the Fund's operating expense ratio. Any amounts
distributed to a stockholder in excess of such stockholder's tax
basis in his or her stock will generally be taxable to the
stockholder as capital gain.

The Fund currently expects that the amount of distributions made
under the Managed Distribution Policy generally will be independent
of, and not contingent upon, the Fund's performance in any of the
first three quarters of the Fund's fiscal year. Distribution rates
under the Managed Distribution Policy may be increased in the Fund's
fourth fiscal quarter in light of the Fund's performance for the
fiscal year and to enable the Fund to comply with the distribution
requirements applicable to regulated investment companies. It also
is currently expected that the Fund's investment portfolio initially
will not produce sufficient dividend and interest income to fully
fund distributions under the Managed Distribution Policy.
Consequently, if the Fund does not realize sufficient short-term
capital gains and long-term capital gains to make up any shortfall,
distributions to the Fund's common stockholders will include returns
of capital. Prior to receipt of the above-referenced exemptive
order, long-term capital gains will be available to make up any
shortfall in funding distributions only on an annual basis, thereby
increasing the likelihood that distributions will include returns of
capital to stockholders. The Fund is not required to maintain the
Managed Distribution Policy and such policy (including the amount of
the quarterly distribution) may be modified or terminated at any
time without notice. Any such modification or termination of the
Managed Distribution Policy may have an adverse effect on the market
price of the Fund's common stock.
