    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") increased by 18.2%* in U.S. dollar terms for
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006. During the same period, the Taiwan Total
Return Index (TRI) increased by 13.8% in U.S. dollar terms. The Fund
outperformed the TRI by 3.9% during the year.

The out-performance was due to both sector allocation and stock selection. On a
sector basis, the Fund's overweight positions in the technology sector and
underweight positions in the financial sector enhanced performance. Stock
selection in technology, financial and industrials sectors all benefited
performance during the year.

In the technology sector, the Fund's exposure to IT hardware companies Hon Hai
and Foxconn Tech continued to positively contribute to performance due to strong
earnings growth. IT component companies such as Tripod Technology and Catcher
Technology also added to relative performance. In the financial sector, the
biggest performance contributor was insurance company Cathay FHC. On the
negative side, the Fund's overweight positions in transistor liquid crystal
display ("TFT-LCD") and underweight positions in materials mildly detracted from
relative performance during the year.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Considering the softening U.S. housing market, rising oil prices and geographic
risk, global economic growth will likely slow. The World Bank forecasts global
economic growth of 3.2% and 3.3% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") leading
indicators were down 0.1 point in June to 109.7 from 109.8 in May. The 6-month
rate of change fell for the third consecutive month, signaling that a modest
slowdown is underway in the Major Seven countries.

After strong growth in the first quarter of 2006, U.S. GDP growth decreased to
2.5% in the second quarter of 2006. Household consumer spending, accounting for
60 percent of U.S. GDP, has continued to slow recently. The Fed has put a hold
on interest rate hikes after 17

consecutive rises, leaving the federal funds rate at 5.25%. We believe that the
accumulative effects of previous liquidity tightening and slowing demand can be
expected to ease inflationary pressure. Orders for non-defense and ex-aircraft
capital goods, indicating future business investment, continue to rise. Although
U.S. consumption is retrenching, business investment spending is expected to
sustain the economy.

Taiwan's financial indicators have been weak of late, while real economic
activity indicators have been solid. This explains why the Leading Index has
been stagnating. Taiwan's economic growth edged down to 4.7% in the second
quarter of 2006, due to slackening domestic demand. Economic growth in the first
half of 2006 was underpinned by soaring net exports. We anticipate the economy
will grow at a slower pace in the second half of 2006 and 2007, given soft
domestic demand and a less favorable global environment. We anticipate Taiwan's
GDP to grow by 4.0% and 3.6% in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Private consumption, negatively impacted by cash/credit card loan problems and
negative real wage growth, is weighing on GDP in Taiwan. Both consumer
confidence and real purchasing power are being affected. We expect consumer
banking problems to linger for one to two more quarters and consumption momentum
to recover moderately. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.8% in 2006
and 2.3% in 2007. On the investment front, domestic investment appears to be
sluggish, making a negative contribution of 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth
in the second quarter of 2006. Capital equipment imports have increased over the
past two months, showing signs of modest rebound of investment momentum. The
investment momentum is expected to pick up gradually into 2007. We expect gross
fixed capital investment to decline by 0.5% in 2006, before rising about 1.6%
growth in 2007. In addition, the Taiwan government has vowed to push
cross-strait policies, including opening up the local tourism market to Chinese
visitors and starting regular cross-strait charter flights. If these
cross-strait policies materialize, businesses will likely benefit and investment
confidence and market sentiment will likely improve.

Exports, thanks to solid foreign demand, have grown at a brisk rate so far this
year. China and the United States, accounting for about 50% of Taiwan's exports,
are the two major drivers of Taiwan's foreign trade. However, with the U.S.
economy slowing and private consumption declining, strong export growth is not
expected to be sustained

                                                                               5

but to grow at a slower pace toward year-end and 2007. Moreover, the Chinese
government has reinitiated macro-control measures. It has continued to tighten
up liquidity. If it allows further appreciation of the Chinese currency,
China-bound exports will likely take a hit. Given the external outlook and high
base, we expect Taiwan's exports growth to slow. We anticipate Taiwan's export
growth to be 9% in 2006 and 5% in 2007, respectively.

While real interest rates are still relatively low and the rate disparity
between the U.S. dollar and NT dollar still has room to improve, we expect
Taiwan's central bank to continue to raise the rediscount rate. Consumer prices
have risen by 1.4% since the beginning of the year -- reflecting moderate
inflation compared with the average number of 2% over the past two years.
However, wholesale prices jumped by 9.1% year-over-year in July, affected by
rising crude oil and basic metal prices. Inflationary pressure is looming. The
Consumer Price Index is expected grow by 1.8% in 2006. With the Fed pausing
interest rate increases, Japan's zero-interest-rate policy having been lifted
and China continuing macro tightening, more funds are expected to flow into
Asia. We expect to see mild NT dollar appreciation, as with other Asian
currencies.

We believe Taiwan's economy will continue to grow on foreign demand. However,
the contribution of net exports to growth will likely level-off as external
demand remains volatile and domestic demand picks up. We expect modest growth
for the remainder of the year and in 2007 for Taiwan's economy.

MARKET OUTLOOK AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Following a nice run in the first four months of 2006, the TAIEX pulled back
significantly from early-May to July, due mainly to rising global risk aversion
(from mounting inflation/interest rate fears) and worse-than-expected technology
data-points. Investors' expectations for technology demand in the second quarter
of 2006 were originally fairly high despite it being the traditional slow
season. However, market conditions have turned out to be sluggish, with poor PC
sales and inventory mounting in the semiconductor, TFT-LCD, and even handset
space. With expectations declining, the technology sub-index has dropped over
20% from its peak this year. Following the sharp correction, we expect
technology shares to regain momentum as the inventory

 6

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

correction finishes and restocking begins. We expect current restocking activity
to continue into the fourth quarter of 2006.

In the current cycle, inventory levels in the technology industry have been
below historical averages due to better capital expenditure discipline over the
past few years. After experiencing worse-than-expected market conditions in the
middle of 2006, semiconductor inventory is indeed high, but inventory in
channels and at system makers remains reasonable. This means that when seasonal
demand kicks in, it will quickly feed through the food chain, leading to a
reduction in upstream inventory.

While the technology sector is set for a rebound in the short term, this does
not mark the start of a genuine recovery, in our view. In the near term, further
earnings downgrades are likely on the back of lackluster company guidance and
muted macro data. Together with a lack of new major products/applications to
drive tech demand in the second half of 2006, upside for technology shares will
be capped, although niche players that deliver solid financial results are
expected to perform well on a per share basis. As a result, the likelihood of
the TAIEX exceeding its previous high of 7,474 points is low. Apart from
technology fundamentals, continued political noise, sluggish performance of the
financial sector, and uncertainty surrounding inflation and consumption in the
United States are also casting a shadow over the TAIEX.

In Taiwan, the President Chen administration is being weakened by a spate of
scandals. Former Democratic Progressive Party ("DPP") chairman Shih Ming-teh's
campaign against Chen has created further political noise in the stock market.
Premier Su, the likely DPP candidate for the next presidential election, has
been struggling with party hardliners to improve cross-strait links. But
progress has been disappointing. While restrictions on Chinese visitors to
Taiwan are likely to be eased soon, the removal of the 40% investment limit in
China (which has a more significant impact on corporate earnings) is not
expected to happen in the near term.

Accounting for 16% of the index in terms of market cap, the performance of
financial shares has a significant impact on the TAIEX. Affected by the cash and
credit card crisis, Taiwan's cash and credit card loans as a percentage of total
lending has declined markedly from the peak of 4.0% in November 2005 to 3.0% in
June 2006, with total loans down from NT$657 billion to NT$509 billion during
the same period. As cash and credit card write-offs amounted to as much as

                                                                               7
<PAGE>

    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NT$85 billion in the first half of 2006, aggregate earnings of local banks
plunged 57% to NT$36 billion during the same period. Major financial holding
companies noted in their investor conferences that one-month-pass-due loans
peaked in the second quarter of 2006, but that charge-offs won't peak until the
third quarter of 2006, making the amount of provisions in the second half of
2006 similar to that in the first half of 2006. During the previous corporate
banking crisis (1998-1999), banks turned to the consumer business after being
hit by huge write-offs. Profits reached record highs on low interest rates and
reversal of write-offs in 2004. In the current cash/credit card crisis, however,
funding costs are higher due to rising interest rates, average lending rates are
shrinking due to reduced card loans, and disposal losses of non-performing loans
are high. These factors have combined to pressure banking earnings and thus
related shares' performance in the near term. Though the pain may be eased in
the fourth quarter of 2006, with more profits coming from declining provisions,
sluggish top line momentum (due to a lack of revenues from high yield assets)
and undecided repayment rate of restructured bad loans are still major
uncertainties in the long term.

On the macro front, while the Fed's rate hikes have paused amid positive
inflation numbers, the market focus is seemingly switching from interest rate
concerns to the slowing U.S. economy. The stubbornly high oil prices and
slower-than-expected U.S. housing data will be likely to have a negative impact
on U.S. consumption, and thus the export growth of Asian countries. Christmas
sales will be a key indicator for judging the strength of U.S. consumption.

Despite the aforementioned negative factors, we believe the TAIEX will be
protected by the Fed's move to pause rate hikes (which should cause liquidity to
flow back to Asia) and the upcoming peak season for technology companies. Thus,
we expect the TAIEX to be range bound until the fourth quarter of 2006.
Technology is our favorite sector, particularly dynamic random access memory
("DRAM"), handset, and packaging & testing. However, we would underweight
operators in the Fund's portfolio. After the expected technology bounce, we may
add some positions in financials to the Fund's portfolio at the year end of 2006
when the sector is expected to bottom out.

We believe we will see a more significant pick-up in technology fundamentals in
the fourth quarter of 2006 and onwards. Our long-term positive view towards the
TAIEX remains intact as: (1) underlying

 8
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

valuations remain attractive on both a regional and historical basis; and (2)
global emerging market funds remain underweight Taiwan.

Potential catalysts for the TAIEX include: (1) the scheduled launch of
Microsoft's Vista consumer operating system in January 2007, which could be a
key catalyst for a tech sector rally; and (2) switch to an expansionary policy
by the Fed. Although this is uncertain, history suggests it will have a positive
impact on the stock market if it happens.

To conclude, we expect investors to receive reasonable rewards from certain
sectors' positive results. In the year ahead, we intend to maintain the Fund's
exposure in high-beta stocks to take advantage of these diverse themes and
achieve better investment returns. We will continue to strive to achieve
superior performance through a process of bottom-up stock selection. We are
confident that the Taiwanese stock market and healthy economic conditions will
provide significant investment opportunities for investors in the foreseeable
future.

Thank you for your support and we look forward to presenting our strategy again
in coming reports.

Sincerely,

    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a Delaware corporation, is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end management investment company.

The Fund is not permitted to invest directly in the securities of Republic of
China ("ROC") companies. Therefore, it invests through a contractual securities
investment trust fund arrangement. This arrangement was established by means of
the Securities Investment Trust, Investment Management and Custodian Contract
("Management Contract") among HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited ("Adviser"), the
International Commercial Bank of China ("Custodian") and the Fund. Under the
Management Contract the Adviser manages and invests the assets of the Fund and
the Custodian holds the assets. The Fund is the sole beneficiary of the assets
held under the Management Contract and, as required by ROC regulations, its
interest in the assets is evidenced by units of beneficial interest.

The Fund concentrates its investments in the securities listed on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange. Because of this concentration, the Fund may be subject to
additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in
Taiwan and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws of currency
exchange restrictions affecting Taiwan.

The policies described below are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

Security Valuation.  All securities, including those traded over-the-counter,
for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sales
price prior to the time of determination of the Fund's net asset value per share
or, if there were no sales on such date, at the closing price quoted for such
securities (but if bid and asked quotations are available, at the mean between
the last current bid and asked prices, rather than such quoted closing price).
In certain instances where the price determined above may not represent fair
market value, the value is determined in such manner as the Board of Directors
may prescribe. Foreign securities may be valued at fair value according to
procedures approved by the Board of Directors if the closing price is not
reflective of current market values due to trading or events occurring in the
valuation time of the Fund. In addition, substantial changes in values in the
U.S. markets subsequent to the close of a foreign market may also affect the
values of securities traded in the foreign market. The value of foreign
securities may be adjusted if such movements in the U.S. market exceed a
specified threshold. Short-term investments, having a maturity of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, with accrued
interest or discount earned included in interest receivable.

Repurchase Agreements.  In connection with transactions in repurchase
agreements, it is the Fund's policy that its custodian take possession of the
underlying collateral securities, the fair value of which exceeds the principal
amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest, at all times.
If the seller defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

Foreign Currency Translation.  The financial accounting records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate. Purchases and sales of securities, income receipts and
expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
dates of the transactions.

Reported net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from disposition of foreign currencies, currency
gains and losses realized between the trade dates and settlement dates of
security transactions, and the difference between the amount of net investment
income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are not
segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of changes in market
prices of those securities, but are included in realized and unrealized gain or
loss on investments in securities.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Forward Foreign Currency Transactions.  A forward foreign currency contract
("Forward") is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell currency at a set
price on a future date. The Fund may enter into Forwards in order to hedge
foreign currency risk or for other risk management purposes. Realized gains or
losses on Forwards include net gains or losses on contracts that have matured or
which the Fund has terminated by entering into an offsetting closing
transaction. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation of Forwards is included in
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and is carried on a net basis. The
portfolio could be exposed to risk of loss if the counterparty is unable to meet
the terms of the contract or if the value of the currency changes unfavorably.
As of August 31, 2006 the Fund had no open Forwards.

Indemnification Obligations.  Under the Fund's organizational documents, its
Officers and Trustees are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of
the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course
of business the Fund enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications
to other parties. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.

Taxes.  As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent
that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains for its fiscal year. In addition to federal income tax
for which the Fund is liable on undistributed amounts, the Fund is subject to
federal excise tax on undistributed investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains. The Schedule of Investments includes information
regarding income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information." The Fund is
organized in Delaware and as such is required to pay Delaware an annual
franchise tax. Also, the Fund is currently subject to a Taiwan security
transaction tax of 0.3% on equities and 0.1% on mutual fund shares of the
transaction amount.

The Fund's functional currency for tax reporting purposes is the New Taiwan
dollar.

Investment Income.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except
where the ex-dividend date may have passed; certain dividends from foreign
securities are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date.

Taiwanese companies typically declare dividends in the Fund's third fiscal
quarter of each year. As a result, the Fund receives substantially less dividend
income in the first half of its year. Interest income, which includes accretion
of original discount, is accrued as earned.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received.

Distributions to Shareholders.  The distributable income from the assets held
under the Management Contract, which is limited to cash dividends and interest
income received, may be distributed to the Fund only once in each year at the
Fund's discretion and is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized capital
gains and stock dividends may also be distributed to the Fund. Within the above
limitations the Fund will, under current ROC regulations, be able to remit out
of the ROC the proceeds of income and capital gains distributions, unit
redemptions and other distributions of assets held under the Management
Contract.

The Fund distributes to shareholders at least annually, substantially all of its
taxable ordinary income and expects to distribute its taxable net realized
gains. Certain foreign currency gains (losses) are taxable as ordinary income
and, therefore, increase (decrease) taxable ordinary income available for
distribution. Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"), shareholders may elect to have all distributions automatically
reinvested in Fund shares. (See the summary of the Plan.) Shareholders who do
not participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check
in U.S. dollars. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. No capital gain distributions shall be made
until any capital loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or expired.

                                                                              19

    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency
transactions, losses deferred due to wash sales and net operating losses.
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder distributions
will result in reclassifications to paid in capital. Reclassifications recorded
at August 31, 2006 were ($42,483) from undistributed Net Investment Income,
$1,028,869 from Accumulated Gain (Loss) and ($986,386) to Paid in Capital.

Security Transactions.  Security transactions are accounted for as of the trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

2. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, purchases and sales of securities,
other than short-term securities, aggregated $290,468,222 and $286,516,720,
respectively.

3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Management Fee.  As the Fund's investment adviser, HSBC Investments (Taiwan)
Limited (the "Adviser") receives a basic fee that is computed daily at an annual
rate of 1.30% of the Fund's average net assets. The basic fee is subject to
monthly performance adjustments based on the Fund's investment performance as
compared to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index over a rolling 36-month period. The
basic fee may increase or decrease by + or -0.30% depending on the Fund's
performance.

For the year ended August 31, 2006, the management fee, including the
performance adjustments, was equivalent to an annual rate of 1.20% of average
net assets, excluding the following one-time charge. During the period, the
basic fee included a one-time charge of approximately $154,000 as a further
revision to correct errors in the calculation of performance fee adjustments for
the fiscal years prior to 2000 (See footnote 6). The management fee including
this charge is equivalent to an annual rate of 1.15% of average net assets.

Directors Fees.  No director, officer or employee of the Adviser or its'
affiliates will receive any compensation from the Fund for serving as an officer
or director of the Fund. The Fund pays each of its directors who is not a
director, officer or employee of the Adviser an annual fee of $15,000 plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or other Committee meeting attended,
and $2,000 for each meeting attended by telephone. On July 18, 2005 the Board of
Directors approved an increase in the annual fee from $10,000 to $15,000
effective September 1, 2005. In addition, the Fund will reimburse each of the
directors for travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
Board of Directors' meetings.

Administration Fees.  State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street")
provides, or arranges for the provision of certain administrative and accounting
services for the Fund, including maintaining the books and records of the Fund,
and preparing certain reports and other documents required by federal and/or
state laws and regulations. The Fund pays State Street a fee at the annual rate
of 0.11% of the Fund's average daily net assets up to $150 million, 0.08% of the
next $150 million, and 0.05% of those assets in excess of $300 million, subject
to certain minimum requirements. The Fund also pays State Street $130,000 per
year for certain legal administrative services, including corporate secretarial
services and preparing regulatory filings.

4. FUND SHARES

At August 31, 2006, there were 20,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value capital
stock authorized, of which 16,365,572 were issued and outstanding.

5. DISTRIBUTIONS

The Fund made a distribution of $856,410 from ordinary income during the year
ended August 31, 2006. As of August 31, 2006, the components of distributable
earnings on a tax basis were $0 of Undistributed Ordinary Income, $0 of
Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gain, $65,273,168 of Unrealized Appreciation and
($32,501,720) of accumulated capital and other losses.

The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash
sales.

6. PRIOR PERIODS RESTATEMENT

On August 31, 2004, the Fund restated its statement of changes in net assets for
the year ended August 31, 2003 and its financial highlights for the years ended
August 31, 2000 through 2003 to reflect correction of errors in the calculation
of management fee performance adjustments recorded by the Fund during these
years and prior. The incorrect performance adjustments were calculated based on
average net assets of the Fund over a period different than the period over
which average net assets of the Fund should have been calculated as stipulated
in the Management Contract and resulted in overpayments being made to the
investment adviser. The cumulative effect at September 1, 1999, and the yearly
net effect, of these corrections on net assets, net asset value per share and
the ratio of expenses were as follows:

7. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48- Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which
requires the tax effects of certain tax positions to be recognized. These tax
positions must meet a "more likely than not" standard that based on their
technical merits, have a more than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
examination. FASB Interpretation No. 48 is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after December 15, 2006. At adoption, the financial statements must be
adjusted to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be
sustained. Management of the Fund is currently evaluating the impact that FASB
Interpretation No. 48 will have on the Fund's financial statements.

                                                                              21

    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN?

The Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") offers
shareholders of the Fund, a prompt and simple way to reinvest their dividends
and capital gains distributions in shares of the Fund. The Fund will distribute
to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its net income and
expects to distribute annually its net realized capital gains. Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (formerly, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.) (the "Plan
Administrator"), a federally chartered trust institution, acts as Plan
Administrator for shareholders in administering the Plan. The Plan also allows
you to make optional cash investments in Fund shares through the Plan
Administrator.

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN?

If you own shares in your own name, you can elect to participate directly in the
Plan. If you own shares that are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or
other nominee, you should contact your nominee to arrange for them to
participate on your behalf.

WHAT DOES THE PLAN OFFER?

The Plan has two components; reinvestment of dividends and capital gains
distributions, and a voluntary cash purchase feature.

REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS DISTRIBUTIONS

If you choose to participate in the Plan, your dividends and capital gains
distributions will be promptly invested for you, automatically increasing your
holdings in the Fund. If the Fund declares a dividend or capital gains
distribution payable in cash, you will automatically receive shares purchased by
the Plan Administrator on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open
market.

If a distribution is declared which is payable in shares or cash at the option
of the shareholder and if on the valuation date (generally the payable date) the
market price of shares is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, the Fund
will issue new shares to you at the greater of the following: (a) net asset
value per share or (b) 95% of the market price per share. If the market price
per share on the valuation date is less than the net asset value per share, the
Fund will issue new shares to you at the market price per share on the valuation
date.

All reinvestments are in full and fractional shares, carried to three decimal
places. In the case of foreign (non-U.S.) shareholders, reinvestment will be
made net of applicable withholding tax.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE OPTION

Plan participants have the option of making investments in Fund shares through
the Plan Administrator. You may invest any amount from $100 to $3,000
semi-annually. The Plan Administrator will purchase shares for you on the New
York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market on or about February 15 and
August 15. If you hold shares in your own name, you should deal directly with
the Plan Administrator. Checks should be make payable to "Computershare". The
Plan Administrator will not accept cash, traveler's checks, money orders, or
third party checks for voluntary cash purchase. We suggest you send your check
to the following address to be received at least two business days before the
investment date: Computershare, c/o The Taiwan Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010. The Plan Administrator will return any cash payments
received more than thirty days prior to February 15 or August 15, and you will
not receive interest on uninvested cash payments. If you own shares that are
held in the name

                                                                              25
<PAGE>
    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your nominee to
arrange for them to participate in the cash purchase option on your behalf.

IS THERE A COST TO PARTICIPATE?

Each participant will pay a pro rata portion of brokerage commissions payable
with respect to purchases of shares by the Plan Administrator on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market. Otherwise, there is no charge to
participants for reinvesting dividends and capital gains distributions, since
the Plan Administrator's fees are paid by the Fund. Brokerage charges for
purchasing shares through the Plan are expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charges for individual transactions, because the Plan Administrator
will purchase stock for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower
commissions for each individual participant.

For purchases from voluntary cash payments, participants are charged a service
fee of $.75 for each investment and a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.

Brokerage commissions and service fees, if any, will be deducted from amounts to
be invested.

WHAT ARE THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS?

You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to help
you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

If the Fund issues shares upon reinvestment of a dividend or capital gains
distribution, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount reportable in
respect of the reinvested amount of the dividend or distribution will be the
fair market value of the shares received as of the payment date, which will be
reportable as ordinary dividend income and/or long term capital gains. The
shares will have a tax basis equal to such fair market value, and the holding
period for the shares will begin on the day after the payment date. State, local
and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PLAN, MAY I WITHDRAW FROM IT?

You may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by calling the Plan
Administrator at 1-800-426-5523, by accessing your Plan account at the Plan
Administrator's web site, www.computershare.com/equiserve or by written notice
to the Plan Administrator.

If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in
your name for all full shares, or, if you wish, the Plan Administrator will sell
your shares and send you the proceeds, less a service fee of $2.50 and less
brokerage commissions. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares
you hold at the time of your withdrawal to cash at the current market price and
send you a check for the proceeds.

All sale requests having an anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are
expected to be submitted in the written form. In addition, all sale requests
within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be submitted in
written form.

WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION?

If you hold shares in your own name, please address all notices, correspondence,
questions, or other communications regarding the Plan to: Computershare, c/o The

your shares are not held in your name, you should contact your brokerage firm,
bank, or other nominee for more information and to arrange for them to
participate in the Plan on your behalf.

Either the Fund or the Plan Administrator may amend or terminate the Plan.
Except in the case of amendments necessary or appropriate to comply with
applicable law, rules or policies or a regulatory authority, participants will
be mailed written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any
amendment. In the case of termination, participants will be mailed written
notice at least 30 days before the record date of any dividend or capital gains
distribution by the Fund.

which are attached hereto as Exhibit 12(a)(4).

ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANY.

(a)(1)   As of September 30, 2006, the portfolio managers of the registrant are
as follows:

CHIH-HUI LEE

Mr. Lee has been the Lead Portfolio Manager of the Taiwan Fund, Inc. since
September 9, 2006. Mr. Lee is a Senior Fund Manager and Vice President of HSBC
Investments (Taiwan) Limited. Since joining HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited in
September, 2005, Mr. Lee has managed the HSBC Taiwan Electronic Fund and HSBC
Taiwan Small and Mid Cap Fund. As of September 30, 2006, Mr. Lee only manages
the Taiwan Fund, Inc.

Prior to joining HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited, Mr. Lee worked at Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management (Taiwan) where he was Head of Domestic Equities
(January 2003 to August 2005) and a Fund Manager (March 2002 to January 2003).
Prior to that, Mr. Lee worked at Allianz President Life Insurance in Taiwan
where he was an Equity Analyst (September 2000 to March 2002). Mr. Lee began his
investment career in 1999 as an analyst at Allianz Asset Management in Hong
Kong.

STEVEN CHAN

Since joining HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited in October 2005, Mr. Chan has

                                       5
<PAGE>

(a)(2)

As of September 30, 2006, Mr. Lee managed the Taiwan Fund, Inc. with a total of
approximately $283 million in assets. As of September 30, 2006, Mr. Lee does not
manage any other mutual funds, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts.

As of September 30, 2006, Mr. Chan does not manage any other mutual funds,
pooled investment vehicles or other accounts but only co-manages the Taiwan
Fund, Inc. with Mr. Lee.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Although Mr. Lee and Mr. Chan do not currently manage any
other mutual fund, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts, actual or
potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager has
management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund. For example, a
portfolio manager may identify a limited investment opportunity that may be
appropriate for the Fund as well as for the other funds or accounts he manages.
A conflict of interest also might arise where a portfolio manager has a larger
personal investment in one fund than in another. A portfolio manager may
purchase a particular security for one or more funds while selling the security
for one or more other funds; this could have a detrimental effect on the price
or volume of the securities purchased or sold by a fund. A portfolio manager
might devote unequal time and attention to the funds he manages. The Investment
Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies and procedures that it
believes are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of
interest. As a result, the Investment Adviser does not believe that any of these
potential sources of conflicts of interest will affect the portfolio managers'
professional judgment in managing the Fund. However, there is no guarantee that
such procedures will detect each and every situation where a conflict arises.

(a)(3)

COMPENSATION:

The Investment Adviser has structured a compensation program based on factors
designed to attract and retain key personnel as well as to provide incentives
for top quality performance. The program is designed to recognise the long-term
nature of the firm's business, and to encourage retention and continuity of
service of the people who contribute to the organization's success.

The Investment Adviser, through a performance review system rewards both team
and individual contribution. Each individual has a job profile and a set of Key
Performance Measures ("KPMs") to ensure that the year's objectives are clear and
attainable. KPMs do not just reflect tangible outputs of an individual's role;
they also incorporate the behaviours and team efforts displayed by each member
of staff. Thus, the firm's portfolio managers are not assessed solely on the
performance of the funds that they manage.

Investment professionals typically receive a base salary and an incentive bonus.
The total sum set aside for bonus payments each year is a function of HSBC
Investment's profitability as a whole. In determining the amount to allocate to
each individual, three factors are assessed:

     - The performance of the local company;
     - The performance of the investment team; and
     - The performance of the individual.

During the annual appraisal process, each department manager reviews his/her
team's performance and contribution to the Investment Adviser for the past year
on an individual basis. Bonuses and raises are


                                       6
<PAGE>

awarded based on the individual's contribution to the team. Promotions are
awarded to individuals who have performed well beyond what was expected for
their level.

         or 15d-15(b) under the 1934 Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or
         240.15d-15(b)).

(b)      There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17

         materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
