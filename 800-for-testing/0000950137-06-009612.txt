PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index is generally representative of
high-yield securities. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales
charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be
considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

The Lehman Brother U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index is generally
representative of high-yield securities. Based on the Trust's asset composition,
the Trust's Investment Advisor, believes the Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High
Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index is the more appropriate broad-based benchmark for the
Trust than the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index. The Trust began using the
Lehman Brother's U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index in April 2006.

                                                                               1

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

The high-yield market performed well during the reporting period, especially in
the first quarter of the year, as continued economic strength, a strong equity
market and increased investor appetite for risk combined to support the market.
Gains in high yield came despite declining Treasury prices, tight credit
spreads, moderate new bond issuance and outflows from mutual funds. High-yield
market returns slowed in the second quarter as rising market volatility,
concerns about inflation and increased issuance dampened performance. The end
result was modestly positive returns for the six-month period.

In keeping with this performance pattern, high-yield credit spreads (a
reflection of investors' willingness to assume credit risk) tightened during the
first three months of the year, leveled off early in the second quarter, then
widened in June, closing the reporting period at 359 basis points over U.S.
Treasuries.

Within the high-yield asset class, the riskiest segment of the
market--securities rated CCC and below--outperformed high-rated securities
throughout the reporting period. Industry sector returns, however, varied
considerably. The strongest performing sectors included transportation (due to
strong gains by the auto component), manufacturing, telecommunication services,
retail and cable. The worst performers included the energy, broadcasting,
information technology, health care and utilities sectors. Forest products, the
leading sector in the first quarter, turned in poor performance in the second
quarter.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns may differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV and Market price basis, the trust underperformed both the
Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index and the J.P.
Morgan Global High Yield Index.

Early in the reporting period, we reduced risk in the trust's portfolio by
increasing its overall credit quality. This defensive positioning versus the
benchmark was the main reason for the trust's relative underperformance, as it
kept the trust from participating fully in the first quarter's rally of lower-
quality securities.

Security selection in the trust's portfolio provided more mixed results.
Selected issues in the forest products and food/tobacco sectors detracted from
returns. On a more positive note, security selection in transportation and
utilities contributed to overall returns during the period.

Over the course of the reporting period, we remained focused on maintaining a
balanced and well-diversified portfolio while also implementing strategic
overweights in securities and sectors that we believed offered the most
attractive risk profiles. As part of the trust's overall conservative
positioning, we added to its exposure to traditionally defensive sectors such as
food and tobacco and health care, and reduced the portfolio's exposure to what
we believed were riskier companies in the housing sector. We also added to the
portfolio's exposure to companies in the automotive sector. The trust ended the
period with lower exposure to manufacturing and wireless companies, where bonds
were either called or tendered.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Federal Open Market
Committee's policy of raising interest rates throughout the period made the
trust's borrowing activity more expensive, thereby tempering its benefits.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

CHANGES TO INVESTMENT POLICIES

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

Swaps. The Trust recently approved a change in its investment policies to allow
the Trust to enter into interest rate, index, total rate of return and credit
default swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps, floors and collars. The
Trust expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or
spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio, as a duration
management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of
securities the Trust anticipates purchasing at a later date. The Trust intends
to use these transactions as hedges and not as speculative investments and will
not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other
instruments providing the income stream the Trust may be obligated to pay.

                                                                               3

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the Trust with another party of
their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g., an exchange of
floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount
of principal. The purchase of an interest rate cap entitles the purchaser, to
the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate, to
receive payments of interest on a contractually-based principal amount from the
party selling the interest rate cap. The purchase of an interest rate floor
entitles the purchaser, to the extent that a specified index falls below a
predetermined interest rate, to receive payments of interest on a
contractually-based principal amount from the party selling the interest rate
floor. An interest rate collar combines the elements of purchasing a cap and
selling a floor. The collar protects against an interest rate rise above the
maximum amount but foregoes the benefit of an interest rate decline below the
minimum amount. An index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional
amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices. For example, the
Trust may agree to swap the return generated by a fixed-income index for the
return generated by a second fixed-income index. The purchase of a cap entitles
the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party
selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined
interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to
receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such
floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest
rate or amount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a
certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values.

A total rate of return swap is an agreement in which one party (total return
payer) transfers the total economic performance of a reference obligation to the
other party (total return receiver). Total economic performance includes income
from interest and fees, gains or losses from market movements, and credit
losses. The total return receiver assumes the entire economic exposure--that is,
both market and credit exposure--to the reference asset. The total return
payer--often the owner of the reference obligation--gives up economic exposure
to the performance of the reference asset and in return takes on counterparty
credit exposure to the total return receiver in the event of a default or fall
in value of the reference asset.

The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts or credit-linked notes
for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may
otherwise invest. A credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to
exchange the credit risk of an issuer (reference entity). A buyer of a credit
default swap is said to buy protection by paying periodic fees in return for a
contingent payment from the seller if the reference entity has a credit event
such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations or deteriorating
credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit default swap is said
to sell protection and thus collects the periodic fees and profits if the credit
of the reference entity remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding
but the seller in a credit default swap contract would be required to pay an
agreed

<PAGE>

upon amount to the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the
reference entity. A credit-linked note is a synthetic security, typically issued
by a special purpose vehicle, that trades like a bond issued by the reference
entity but with the economics of the credit default swap. For this security, the
buyer of protection sells the note. The buyer of protection (note seller) will
pay periodic payments and profit if the reference entity defaults. Unlike the
swap, the buyer of protection in a credit-linked note will receive money at the
time of transaction from the sale of the note, and will return this money at the
contract's maturity if no credit event occurs. Conversely, the seller of
protection purchases the notes. As with a credit default swap, the note
purchaser (protection seller) receives periodic payments. Unlike the swap
transaction, the protection seller must pay for the note at the time of the
transaction and will collect this money at the contract's maturity if no credit
event occurs.

The Trust will enter into swap, cap or floor transactions only with
counterparties approved by the Adviser in accordance with guidelines established
by the Trust's Board of Trustees. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties to the Trust's swap, cap, floor and collar transactions on an
ongoing basis. If there is a default by the other party to such a transaction,
the Trust will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction. The Trust may enter into swaps on either an asset-based or
liability-based basis, and will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e.,
the two payment streams are netted out, with the Trust receiving or paying, as
the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the
excess, if any, of the Trust's obligations over its entitlements with respect to
each swap will be accrued on a daily basis and the Trust segregates an amount of
cash and/or liquid securities having an aggregate net asset value at least equal
to the accrued excess. If the Trust enters into a swap transaction on other than
a net basis, the Trust would segregate the full amount accrued on a daily basis
of the Trust's obligations with respect to the swap. To the extent the Trust
sells (i.e. writes) caps, floors and collars, it will segregate cash and/or
liquid securities having an aggregate net asset value at least equal to the full
amount, accrued on a daily basis, of the Trust's net obligations with respect to
the caps, floors or collars.

The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment
techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio
securities transactions. If the Adviser is incorrect in its forecasts of the
market values, interest rates and other applicable factors, the investment
performance of the Trust would diminish compared with what it would have been if
these investment techniques were not used. The use of swaps may also have the
effect of shifting the recognition of income between current and future periods.

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Multiclass Pass-Through Securities. The
Trust may invest in collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"). CMOs are debt
obligations collateralized by mortgage loans or mortgage pass-through
securities. Typically, CMOs are collateralized by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC

                                                                               5
<PAGE>

certificates, but also may be collateralized by whole loans or private pass-
through securities (such collateral collectively hereinafter referred to as
"Mortgage Assets"). Multiclass pass-through securities are equity interests in a
trust composed of Mortgage Assets. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all
references herein to CMOs include multiclass pass-through securities. Payments
of principal of and interest on the Mortgage Assets, and any reinvestment income
thereon, provide the funds to pay debt service on the CMOs or make scheduled
distributions on the multiclass pass-through securities. CMOs deemed to be U.S.
government securities are those issued or guaranteed as to principal and
interest by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government. The issuer of a series of CMOs may elect
to be treated as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (a "REMIC").

In a CMO, a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes. Each
class of CMOs, often referred to as a "tranche," is issued at a specific fixed
or floating coupon rate and has a stated maturity or final distribution date.
Principal prepayments on the Mortgage Assets may cause the CMOs to be retired
substantially earlier than their stated maturities or final distribution dates.
Interest is paid or accrues on all classes of the CMOs on a monthly, quarterly
or semi-annual basis. The principal of and interest on the Mortgage Assets may
be allocated among the several classes of a series of a CMO in innumerable ways.

The Trust may invest in, among others, parallel pay CMOs and Planned
Authorization Class CMOs ("PAC Bonds"). Parallel pay CMOs are structured to
provide payments of principal on each payment date to more than one class. These
simultaneous payments are taken into account in calculating the stated maturity
date or final distribution date of each class, which, as with other CMO
structures, must be retired by its stated maturity date or final distribution
date but may be retired earlier. PAC Bonds generally require payments of a
specified amount of principal on each payment date. PAC Bonds are always
parallel pay CMOs with the required principal payment on such securities having
the highest priority after interest has been paid to all classes. Substantially
all of the CMOs in which the Trust invests are PAC Bonds.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 22, 2006, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the contract over a
period of several months and the non-management trustees held sessions both with
the investment adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and
considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of factors
control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all factors
together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval

<PAGE>

of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and
its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain matters
considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund and changes made
in the Fund's portfolio management team over time. The trustees also discuss
certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the
investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain
accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined that the
nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment adviser
support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio
management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated
expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that
the analysis of the

                                                                              11
<PAGE>

investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At June 30, 2006, the Trust had no when-issued and
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

                                                                              23

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2005, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $60,509,040 which will expire according to the
following table:

    A portion of the capital loss carryforward above was acquired due to a
merger with another regulated investment company, please see Footnote 3 for

above may be limited due to the merger.

    At June 30, 2006, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually to common shareholders. Distributions from net
realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains which are
included in ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31,
2005 were as follows:

<Table>

    As of December 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $227,255
Long-term capital gain......................................       -0-
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of 0.70% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. Effective July 1,
2006, the Adviser has voluntary agreed to waive investment advisory fees equal
to 0.05% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. This waiver is voluntary
in nature and can be discontinued at the Advisor's discretion.

    For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $3,700 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the six months ended June 30,
2006, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $26,300 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as, the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Legal" expenses on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

                                                                              25

    On July 29, 2005 the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust (ticker symbol VIT) through a tax free reorganization
approved by VIT shareholders on July 22, 2005. The Trust issued 10,784,621
common shares with a net asset value of $49,072,045 and 1,504 Auction Preferred
Shares (APS) with a liquidation value of $37,600,000 in exchange for VIT's net
assets. The shares of VIT were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
0.786581 to 1 and 1 to 4, for common shares and APS, respectively. Net
unrealized depreciation of VIT as of July 29, 2005 was $1,265,478. The Trust
assumed VIT book to tax accretion differences, which resulted in a $263,880
increase to accumulated undistributed net investment income and a corresponding
decrease to net unrealized appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to
common shares on the day of reorganization were $85,969,581 and combined net
assets including preferred shares were $151,369,581. Included in these net
assets was a capital loss carryforward of $33,329,662, of which all can be
utilized by the acquiring Trust, deferred compensation and retirement plan
balance of $229,390 and non-accrual interest income of $16,968, all carried
forward from VIT. The Trust incurred merger expenses of $213,360, which
represent costs related to the preparation, printing, and distribution of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization Agreement and registration statements
as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $43,363,343 and $41,099,915,
respectively.

5. PREFERRED SHARES

As of June 30, 2006, the Trust has outstanding 2,616 Auction Preferred Shares
(APS). Series A contains 1,112 shares and Series B contains 1,504 shares.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are currently reset every 28
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on June 30, 2006 was
5.016%. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the rates ranged from 2.750%
to 5.360%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              27

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 30
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 30 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the

     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
