NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of  Managers").  There are
         six  members of the Board of  Managers,  one of whom is  considered  an
         "interested  person" under the Act. On March 1, 2006, the Company named
         James E. Buck as lead Independent Manager of the Board of Managers. The
         Company's investment adviser is Advantage Advisers Management,  L.L.C.,
         a Delaware limited liability company (the "Adviser").  The Adviser is a
         subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer   Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM")  and  an
         affiliate of  Oppenheimer  & Co. Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is
         responsible for managing the Company's  investment  activities pursuant
         to an  investment  advisory  agreement  dated June 5, 2003.  OAM is the
         managing member of the Adviser,  and Alkeon Capital  Management  L.L.C.
         ("Alkeon")  is  a  non-managing  member  of  the  Adviser.   Investment
         professionals  employed by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who
         serves  as  the  Company's  portfolio  manager,  manage  the  Company's
         portfolio  on  behalf of the  Adviser  under  the  supervision  of OAM.
         Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to approval by the Board of Managers. The Company may from time
         to time offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to written  tenders by
         Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms
         as may be  determined by the Board of Managers,  in their  complete and
         exclusive  discretion.  The  Adviser  expects  that  generally  it will
         recommend to the Board of Managers that the Company offer to repurchase
         interests  from  Members  twice each year,  effective at the end of the
         second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         a.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i)  Domestic  exchange  traded  securities  (other than options and
              those securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

              (1) at their last  composite  sale  prices as  reported  on the
                  exchanges where those securities are traded; or

              (2) If  no  sales  of  those   securities  are  reported  on  a
                  particular  day, the securities are valued based upon their
                  composite  bid prices for  securities  held long,  or their

                  adjusted up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the last traded
                  price is below  such bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best  offer
                  price if the last trade is above such offer price); or

              (2) if no NOCP is  available,  at the  last  sale  price on the
                  NASDAQ prior to the  calculation  of the net asset value of
                  the Company; or

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

             (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

             (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the price
                 will be deemed  "stale"  and the value  will be  determined  in
                 accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Disclosures  about  Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement  ofAssets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         c.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within  three  months at the time of purchase as cash  equivalents.  At
         June 30, 2007, $43,711,449 in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank.

         d.  INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes on
         the  profits of the  Company is made as the  Members  are  individually
         liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

         The  Company  has   reclassified   ($2,272,925)  and  $50,724,619  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2006.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         During the six months ended June 30, 2007,  Oppenheimer earned $129,551
         as brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf
         of the Company.  Mainsail Group,  L.L.C., a broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,   earned  $890,261  as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the six months
         ended June 30, 2007,  an Incentive  Allocation of $394,327 was credited
         to the  Special  Advisory  Members'  capital  account.  Based  upon the
         profits  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2007,  the  incentive
         allocation  that  would  have been  credited  to the  Special  Advisory
         Account is  $24,658,016.  However,  this amount is not reflected in the
         accompanying  Statement  of Changes in  Members'  Capital  because  the
         incentive allocation is credited at the end of the calendar year.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  The
         lead independent manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers
         who are  "interested  persons"  do not  receive any annual or other fee
         from  the  Company.  Managers  who are  not  "interested  persons"  are
         reimbursed  by the Company for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to
         the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
         recordkeeping and investor related  services.  The Company pays PFPC an
         accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the average net
         assets  of the  Company  as of the  last  day of  each  month,  payable
         monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its discretion.  For the six months ended June 30, 2007,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $93,750.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30, 2007, amounted
         to $1,129,521,716 and $1,122,503,485, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,  for the six  months  ended  June  30,  2007,  amounted  to
         $665,285,347 and $658,774,775, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2006,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $483,709,250, and $214,852,584, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2006,  accumulated net
         unrealized  appreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet purchased was  $28,897,783,  consisting  of  $41,381,068  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $12,483,285 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet purchased,  net of excess cash, held at the prime broker as of June
         30, 2007.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  As of June 30, 2007, the Company had no outstanding  margin
         borrowings.  For the six months ended June 30, 2007,  the average daily
         amount of such  borrowings was $605,490 and the daily weighted  average
         annualized interest rate was 5.69%.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include options,
         swaps  and  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,  these
         financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell
         other  financial  instruments  at specific  terms at  specified  future
         dates. Each of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of
         off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the
         securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets,  liabilities and members' capital. Primarily all investments in
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased and due from broker are positions
         with,  and  amounts  due  from,  the  prime  broker,   Morgan  Stanley.
         Accordingly,  the Fund has a concentration  of individual  counterparty
         credit risk with the prime  broker.  The Fund pledges  securities in an
         account at PFPC Trust Company,  for the benefit of the prime broker, to
         meet the margin requirement as determined by the prime broker.

         A swap is a contract  under  which two parties  agree to make  periodic
         payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index or
         the value of some other instrument,  applied to a stated, or "notional"
         amount.  Swaps  generally  can be  classified  as interest  rate swaps,
         currency swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include
         contracts for difference,  depending on the type of index or instrument
         used to calculate the payments.  Such swaps would  increase or decrease
         the Company's  investment  exposure to the  particular  interest  rate,
         currency,  commodity or equity  involved.  Securities  associated  with
         swaps are marked-to-market  based on the Company's valuation procedures
         that are outlined in Section 2b of these notes.  The change in value of
         swaps,  including  the  periodic  amounts  of  interest  to be  paid or
         received on swaps,  is reported  as  unrealized  gains or losses in the
         Statement of Operations.  Net unrealized gains are reported as an asset
         and net unrealized  losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
         of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. A realized gain or loss is
         recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination
         of swap agreements.

         Most  swap   agreements   entered  into  by  the  Company  require  the
         calculation  of the  obligations  of the parties to the agreements on a
         "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap
         agreement  generally will be equal to only to the net amount to be paid
         or received  under the  agreement  based on the relative  values of the
         positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         The Company is subject to the market risk  associated  with  changes in
         the  value  of the  underlying  investment  or  instrument,  as well as
         exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on
         swap  contracts.  The risk of loss with  respect to swaps is limited to
         the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually  obligated
         to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the Fund's risk of loss
         consists of the net amount of payments  that the Company  contractually
         is  entitled  to  receive,  which  may be  different  than the  amounts
         recorded on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         The  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather  than the  notional
         amount,  represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
         respectively.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the
         premium  is added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
         security in  determining  whether  the  Company has  realized a gain or
         loss.  In writing an option,  the  Company  bears the market risk of an
         unfavorable change in the price of the security or index underlying the
         written  option.  Exercise of an option  written by the  Company  could
         result in the Company selling or buying a security at a price different
         from the current  market  value.  During the six months  ended June 30,
         2007, the Company had no transactions in written options.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In September  2006,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157, "FAIR VALUE
         MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
         value for  financial  reporting,  establishes a framework for measuring
         fair value and requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair
         value  measurements.  FAS 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements
         issued for fiscal years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim
         periods within those fiscal years. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
         does not  believe  the  adoption  of FAS 157 will  impact  the  amounts
         reported in the financial statements,  however,  additional disclosures
         will be required about the inputs used to develop the  measurements  of
         fair value and the effect of certain of the  measurements  reported  in
         the statement of operations for a fiscal year.

     10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         Subsequent  to  June  30,  2007,  the  Company   received  initial  and
         additional capital contributions from Members of $10,894,230.

III.     APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting  held on February  28,  2007,  the Board of Managers of the Company
(the "Board")  completed its annual  consideration  of, and approved the renewal
of, the Company's investment advisory agreement with the Adviser.

In  approving  the  renewal of the  investment  advisory  agreement,  the Board,
including each of the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written materials
provided  by the  Adviser  at the  request  of the Board and  assessed:  (i) the
nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided to the  Company;  (ii) the
investment  performance of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii)
advisory  fees and other fees and  expenses  of the Company  (including  fee and
expense  information for comparable  funds) and the profitability of the Adviser
and its affiliates with respect to its relationship  with the Company;  (iv) the
extent to which  economies  of scale would be realized as the  Company's  assets
under management increase;  and (v) whether advisory fee levels reflect any such
economies  of scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also  approved the
renewal  of the  administrative  services  agreement  between  the  Company  and
Oppenheimer,  an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In  considering  the nature,  extent and  quality of  services  that the Adviser
provides  to the  Company,  the Board  reviewed  presentations  from  management
relating to staffing, management and the organizational structure of the various
departments  of  Oppenheimer  providing  services  to  the  Company.  Management
reviewed the investment  management,  compliance,  regulatory  risk  management,
administration, accounting infrastructure and investor related services provided
by the Adviser and Oppenheimer and reviewed the costs  associated with providing
these services.  The Independent  Managers had, over the previous twelve months,
considered var-

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ious  matters  relevant  to the  consideration  of the  renewals  of the various
agreements,  including:  the nature, extent and quality of the services provided
to the Company; Oppenheimer's commitment to the advisory business, including the
alternative  investment  advisory  business,  and its  platform  of  proprietary
products;  the research and portfolio  management  capabilities of the personnel
responsible  for managing  the  Company's  assets;  the  appropriateness  of the
Adviser's staffing levels and the commitment of resources to fund accounting and
administration,  shareholder services and regulatory  compliance;  the Adviser's
oversight of third-party service providers; the Company's investment performance
and the profitability of the Adviser  attributable to providing  services to the
Company, among other matters.

Based on its review,  the Board  concluded  that the Company  benefits  from the
services provided by the Adviser,  including  research and portfolio  management
services and also  benefits  from the  administrative  services  and  compliance
infrastructure  provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer.  The Board noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, extent and quality of services provided by
the Adviser and concluded  that the Company was receiving the services  required
from the Adviser under its agreement  with the Company,  and that these services
were of appropriate quality.

In connection with its consideration of the investment advisory  agreement,  the
Board reviewed materials relating to the Company's  investment  performance on a
quarterly basis. The Board also considered the Company's  historical  investment
performance,  including a comparison of such  performance to the  performance of
similar funds and relevant  indices.  The consensus of the Board was that during
the past year the  investment  performance  of the Company had  improved and was
competitive  with its peers.  The Independent  Managers  concluded that the fees
paid to Oppenheimer  and the Adviser were  reasonable and  appropriate  and were
within industry norms, based on the comparisons to similar funds. In particular,
a fee comparison  showed that the fees charged -- a 1.0%  management fee and 20%
incentive  allocation  -- is  comparable  for  similar  products.  The  indirect
benefits  received  by  the  Adviser  and  its  affiliates  attributable  to its
relationships to the Company also were considered.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services  provided by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer
under the investment  advisory agreement and administrative  services agreement,
respectively.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's
fees and expenses to those of comparable  registered  funds,  and concluded that
the  Company's  fees and expenses  are similar to those of the other funds.  The
Board also considered  revenues received by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from the
Company, including fees and incentive allocations, as well as data regarding the
Adviser's financial condition, compensation and profitability, including related
direct and indirect operating expenses relating to the Company and payments made
to  registered  representatives  of  Oppenheimer  for  services  they provide to
investors.  The Board  noted  that  registered  representatives  of  Oppenheimer
continue  to be  paid  out of  Oppenheimer's  resources  for  providing  various
investor  services.  The Board also noted that the positive  performance  of the
Company  during the past year and the  incentive  allocations  from the  Company
resulting from this performance have allowed  Oppenheimer to provide  additional
compensation to financial  advisers whose customers are invested in the Company,
which has  increased  such  financial  advisers'  interest  in the Company as an
investment  option for their customers.  The Board reviewed the methodology used
to estimate these costs, as set forth in the profitability materials provided by
management. It also considered the indi-


                                      -36-

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rect benefits  received by the Adviser and its affiliates  attributable to their
relationships  to  the  Company.   The  Board  noted  the  Adviser's   continued
willingness to manage the Company and  Oppenheimer's  willingness to support the
Adviser's operations evidenced their commitment to providing quality services to
the Company.

Although the Board also noted that the Adviser and Oppenheimer have not realized
significant  profits in the recent past from their  relationship to the Company,
due to positive  investment  performance,  the Adviser had received an incentive
allocation  during the previous  year,  increasing  the  Adviser's  revenues and
profitability  and the  Adviser  and OAM  continue  to be  willing to manage the
Company, thereby evidencing their commitment to the Company.

Based on its review of  information  relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the  profitability  of the Adviser and its  affiliates,  the Board concluded
that  the  Company's   fees  under  the   investment   advisory   agreement  and
administrative services agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the services
provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer,  and  concluded  that the  Company's
advisory fees and expenses were within industry norms.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated with services  provided to the Company,  the Board concluded that, as
economies of scale are predicated on increasing  levels of assets,  economies of
scale are not being  realized at the present time because the asset level of the
Company had not increased appreciably.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

 1. the nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided by the Adviser are
adequate and appropriate;

 2. the fees paid to the Adviser and  Oppenheimer are reasonable and appropriate
in light of comparative  expense and advisory fee information and benefits to be
derived  by the  Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  from  their  relationships  with the
Company;

 3. the Adviser's  fees are  reasonable in light of the advisory fees charged by
the Adviser  (and other  affiliates)  and other  investment  advisers to similar
investment  vehicles  receiving  similar  services and in light of the fact that
absent any  performance  allocation,  the  expenses  associated  with  providing
services to the Company had exceeded in the past,  and may exceed in the future,
the fees payable by the Company.

 4. in the absence of  significant  asset  growth of the  Company,  economies of
scale are not being  realized by the  Adviser or  Oppenheimer  at current  asset
levels; and

 5. the approval of the renewal of the Company's  investment  advisory agreement
and administrative  services agreement for an additional annual period is in the
best interests of the Company and its members.
