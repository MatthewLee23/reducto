John A. Hill and
George Putnam, III

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Although generally benign, recent conditions in financial markets have
hardly been predictable. Over the past 12 months, massive stimulus from
the 2003 tax cuts and from the Federal Reserve Board's low interest-rate
policy has vanquished recessionary forces, restored economic growth, and
recharged corporate earnings. In this environment, bonds have generally
performed well but have been negatively influenced by an
uncharacteristic lack of job growth that has kept bond yields near their
lowest levels in 40 years. However, in months when job creation has
surged, concerns about higher interest rates have caused bond prices to
fall. In addition to these issues, terrorism and geopolitical
uncertainty remain factors that occasionally influence markets, as when
stocks slid and bonds rallied following the March terrorist bombings in
Spain.

Putnam's portfolio management teams have vigilantly monitored all of
these factors and know there are opportunities and risks in any
environment. They consistently adjust fund portfolios to pursue the
opportunities their research identifies while seeking to manage risk
exposure. During the period ended March 31, 2004, your fund benefited
from being well diversified in a variety of sectors -- nearly all of
which showed solid performance -- and from a favorable currency
strategy. Your fund's largest sector, high-yield corporate bonds, was
also its best-performing, while mortgage-backed securities, the
performance of which was dampened by bond market volatility, still had
positive returns. Meanwhile, because of its attractive yield compared
with historically low market interest rates, your fund's return at
market price was higher than its return at net asset value, reflecting
an increase in demand from investors seeking higher income.

In the following report, the fund's management teams provide a detailed
discussion of their approach to the market environment that prevailed
during the period, as well as an outlook for the remainder of 2004.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

 * During the semiannual period ended March 31, 2004, Putnam Master
   Intermediate Income Trust had a total return at net asset value (NAV) of
   7.66%. The fund's return at market price was 11.56%.

 * Due to its emphasis on high-yield bonds and investments in
   emerging-market securities, as well as a beneficial currency strategy,
   the fund's results at NAV outperformed the 3.05% return of its primary
   benchmark, the Lehman Government/Credit Bond Index.

 * The fund's return at NAV was in line with the 7.61% average return of
   the Lipper Flexible Income Funds (closed-end) category. This relatively
   small category -- consisting of 12 funds at period-end -- contains some
   funds with significant emerging-market weightings.

 * The fund's return at market price was significantly higher than its
   return at NAV, reflecting an increase in demand among investors seeking
   higher yields in a market in which yields have continued to decline.

 * See the Performance Summary beginning on page 7 for complete fund
   performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

In the first half of its fiscal year, Putnam Master Intermediate Income
Trust  benefited from a variety of positive factors. The U.S. economy
continued to show solid growth, which was especially beneficial for
corporate high-yield bonds -- which make up the largest portion of your
fund's portfolio. In the second half of the reporting period, the U.S.
economy faltered on significant weakness in new job creation, causing a
correction in the stock market and a strong rally in Treasury bonds, as
investors believed that the sluggish job market could keep interest
rates low. Overseas, emerging markets continued to perform well, due in
part to higher commodity prices, and slower growth in Europe generally
helped bond performance in that region. In this environment, the fund's
strategy of seeking returns from a variety of fixed-income sources
proved beneficial for both its absolute and  relative performance.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust seeks high current income and
relative stability by investing in limited-maturity bonds in the
investment-grade and high-yield sectors, as well as non-U.S. bond
markets. The fund is designed for investors seeking high current income,
asset class diversification, or both.


Market overview

The global bond markets have benefited from a downward trend in interest
rates brought on by a change in the outlook for economic growth. During
the first half of the period, interest rates were more volatile, rising
and falling within a broad range with each bit of news that either
challenged or supported the possibility of a sustained economic
recovery. However, low inflation and an accommodative Federal Reserve
monetary policy helped bond yields to trend generally downward. In the
second half of the period, there was increasing evidence that the U.S.
recovery would not be as strong as anticipated, particularly when the
February jobs report indicated lackluster employment creation. This news
(which appeared premature after stronger data was reported after the
period's end), combined with increasing geopolitical concerns
surrounding the bombings in Spain, made investors somewhat more risk
averse and sparked a rally in U.S. Treasuries.

In Europe, low inflation reduced the likelihood of a rate increase by
the European Central Bank, and European government bonds and securities
produced solid returns that were similarly enhanced by a flight to
quality. Although both U.S. Treasuries and European government bonds
performed well, investors continued to seek out bonds that could provide
higher levels of income.

High-yield corporate bonds in both the United States and Europe
continued to benefit from declining default rates, an attractive yield
advantage over Treasuries, and improved credit quality. In emerging
markets, the strengthening global economy has helped boost commodities
exports, bolstering both the stock and bond markets of these countries,
and attracting yield-hungry investors.

Strategy overview

During the past six months, we continued to seek out a diverse variety
of sectors and securities in our efforts to enhance the fund's
performance while managing its risk exposure. High-yield corporate bonds
continued to provide strong performance and remained the fund's largest
weighting. However, after one of the best periods ever for this sector
- -- which began well before this period, in October 2002, and continued
through December 2003 -- we felt that returns going forward would
probably not be as strong and reduced the weighting. Similarly, we
sharply reduced the fund's emerging-market holdings in January 2004,
near the peak of their performance. Traditional mortgage-backed
securities experienced greater volatility later in the period because,
with home mortgage rates at such low levels, prepayments increased as
borrowers refinanced their mortgages. However, we found alternative
securities within this sector that performed well. The fund's holdings
of U.S. Treasuries benefited from the rally in the second half of the
period, while European government agency securities benefited from their
attractive risk/reward characteristics amid a forecast for slower growth
in Europe in 2004.

We continued to use currency strategies to enhance returns. We
deemphasized the Japanese yen in the first three months, when that
currency declined. However, we increased the fund's exposure to the yen
in the second half, when it appreciated, so both positions helped
performance. We emphasized the euro, which generally appreciated during
the period, and maintained emphasis on the Australian dollar, which also
appreciated due to higher commodities prices and increasing exports to
China and Japan.

six months. Weightings are shown as a percentage of total investment

How sectors and fund holdings affected performance

While the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sector generally
underperformed due to prepayment concerns associated with low mortgage
rates, we found two types of securities within this sector that
performed well -- home equity loans and manufactured housing bonds.
Unlike mortgages, home equity loans are not as susceptible to
prepayments when interest rates decline, helping boost the performance
of securities that are backed by these loans. Similarly, holdings backed
by manufactured housing companies benefited from a significant
turnaround in this industry over the past few years accompanied by an
increase in demand for low-income housing.

From a geographic standpoint, the fund continued to invest in Colombia,
Mexico, and Russia, which performed well because of higher prices of oil
and other commodities -- although we reduced these weightings near the
end of the period. We also invested in Australia and Canada (the latter
was reduced near the end of the period, as we took advantage of strong
performance). As demand for oil and basic materials has increased from
high-growth regions such as China, these countries have seen significant
increases in exports of oil, metals, and other commodities used for
building infrastructure. We reduced the fund's holdings in Turkey and
Brazil, which tend to be much more volatile and performed poorly near
the end of the period when emerging-market securities sold off.

These holdings represent 19.6% of the fund's net assets as of 3/31/04.
The fund's holdings will change over time.

The fund's corporate high-yield bond holdings, which were reduced during
the period, remained the largest weighting and performed well, with
nearly every holding contributing positively to returns. Among the
fund's larger positions, bonds issued by cable television company
Charter Communications were key contributors. While the firm faced
competitive and financial pressures, the company met expectations and
management's moves to refinance debt eased investor concerns about the
company's liquidity.


In addition, bonds issued by finance company Finova Group provided solid
returns. The company had encountered significant difficulties a few
years ago, particularly in its airplane leasing business. The firm has
worked to liquidate assets and manage its sizeable portfolio of loans,
and was helped by a significant loan in 2001 from noted investor Warren
Buffett through a joint venture. The company repaid the loan earlier
this year, ahead of schedule, and prospects for the airline sector have
improved more than expected.

The fund's sizeable stake in the chemicals sector also boosted returns,
including investments in Huntsman International, a major producer of
basic chemicals and petrochemicals like ethylene and propylene, and
Millennium America (a subsidiary of Millennium Chemicals), which owns
three specialty chemical businesses. Although energy prices were high,
leading to skepticism about the sector's prospects, this cyclical sector
benefited from the improving economy.

Among the few detractors to performance during the period were
high-yield bonds issued by Solutia, a diversified specialty chemical
company. The firm made news when it settled a high-profile PCB
contamination lawsuit in Alabama, and appeared to be on its way to
working out balance sheet problems. However, the company surprised the
market by filing for bankruptcy. We eliminated the bonds from the
portfolio, although we still hold a small warrant position, which gives
the fund's management the option to purchase the company's stock in the
future.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in  accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary
in the future.

The fund's management team

The fund is managed by the Putnam Core Fixed-Income Team. The members of
the team are D. William Kohli (Portfolio Leader), David Waldman
(Portfolio Member), Carl Bell, Rob Bloemker, Andrea Burke, Kevin Cronin,
Steve Horner, Michael Salm, and John Van Tassel.


The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

The fund's returns over this six-month period -- and indeed, for the 12
months preceding it -- have been much higher than the historical average
for these types of securities because of optimal conditions. In the
United States, there has been tremendous stimulus in the form of tax
cuts, a weaker dollar, increased government spending, and interest rates
that have been at historically low levels for some time. Meanwhile,
there have been few clear signs from the Federal Reserve Board that
significant rate increases will occur in 2004. The greater willingness
among investors to accept risk has helped boost the capital markets,
which has also provided economic stimulus. Abroad, moderate growth and
low inflation in Europe has kept rates low and government bonds have had
solid performance, while high-yield bonds have seen strong returns
similar to their U.S. counterparts.

While we believe it is not likely that the performance of the past six
months will be repeated in the near future, that doesn't necessarily
mean, in our view, that the environment for these markets will turn
negative. Instead, we believe there is enough uncertainty in the outlook
to warrant cautiousness. On the one hand, the global economy and the
world's fixed-income markets appear on sound footing in most regions. On
the other hand, a significant rise in interest rates or an increase in
geopolitical turmoil -- or both -- could produce shock waves in the
financial markets. Given these uncertainties, we plan to keep the
portfolio well diversified and as balanced as possible among a variety
of geographic regions, sectors, and holdings. We will continue seeking
opportunities for positive returns, and, as always, monitor economic and
market developments and make necessary adjustments to the portfolio as
we see fit.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. International
investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations,
economic instability, and political developments. Additional risks may
be associated with emerging-market securities, including illiquidity and
volatility. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more
risk. Mutual funds that invest in government securities are not
guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk.

A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number
of the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net
investment income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting
period and the most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed
here may not match the sources listed in the Statement of operations
because the distributions are determined on a tax basis and may be paid
in a different period from the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results,   per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

Notes to financial statements
March 31, 2004 (Unaudited)


Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust (the "fund") is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company and is authorized to issue an
unlimited number of shares. The fund's investment objective is to seek,
with equal emphasis, high current income and relative stability of net
asset value, by allocating its investments among the U.S. investment
grade sector, high-yield sector and international sector. The fund
invests in higher yielding, lower rated bonds that have a higher rate of
default due to the nature of the investments.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at fair value on the basis
of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or dealers,
approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine valuations
for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using
methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and
various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders,
between securities. Many securities markets and exchanges outside the
U.S. close prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange and
therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such
exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain
days, the fund will fair value foreign securities taking into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. securities markets.
The number of days on which fair value prices will be used will depend
on market activity and it is possible that fair value prices will be
used by the fund to a significant extent. Securities quoted in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other
investments, including restricted securities, are valued at fair value
following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account The fund may transfer uninvested cash balances,
including cash collateral received under security lending arrangements,
into a joint trading account along with the cash of other registered
investment companies and certain other accounts managed by Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. These balances may be
invested in issuers of high-grade short-term investments having
maturities of up to 397 days for collateral received under security
lending arrangements and up to 90 days for other cash investments.

C) Repurchase agreements The fund, or any joint trading account, through
its custodian, receives delivery of the underlying securities, the
market value of which at the time of purchase is required to be an
amount at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.
Collateral for certain tri-party repurchase agreements is held at the
counterparty's custodian in a segregated account for the benefit of the
fund and the counterparty. Putnam Management is responsible for
determining that the value of these underlying securities is at all
times at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.

D) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. Dividend income, net of applicable withholding taxes, is
recognized on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends, if any, are
recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. All
premiums/ discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis.

E) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net  realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

F) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Forward currency contracts outstanding at
period end, if any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

G) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures
and options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the
hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary
market for the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is
unable to perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement
of assets and liabilities. When the contract is closed, the fund records
a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. Realized gains and losses on purchased options are included in
realized gains and losses on investment securities.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in
the value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as "variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last
sale price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for
purchased options and the last ask price for written options. Options
traded over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers.
Futures and written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

H) Interest rate swap contracts The fund may enter into interest rate
swap contracts, which are arrangements between two parties to exchange
cash flows based on a notional principal amount, to manage the fund's
exposure to interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are marked to
market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if
any, is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made
are recorded as realized gains or loss. The fund could be exposed to
credit or market risk due to unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of
interest rates or if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to
perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets
and liabilities. Interest rate swap contracts outstanding at period end,
if any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

I) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront
payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange for the
right to receive a contingent payment. The maximum amount of the payment
may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index or
security as a result of a related credit event. An upfront payment
received by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a
liability on the fund's books. An upfront payment made by the fund, as
the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset on the fund's books. The
credit default contracts are marked to market daily based upon
quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is recorded as
unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a result of a
credit event or termination of the contract are recognized, net of a
proportional amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses.
In addition to bearing the risk that the credit event will occur, the
fund could be exposed to market risk due to unfavorable changes in
interest rates or in the price of the underlying security or index, the
possibility that the fund may be unable to close out its position at the
same time or at the same price as if it had purchased comparable
publicly traded securities or that the counterparty may default on its
obligation to perform. The risk of loss may exceed the fair value of
these contracts recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities.
Credit default contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

J) TBA purchase commitments The fund may enter into "TBA" (to be
announced) commitments to purchase securities for a fixed unit price at
a future date beyond customary settlement time. Although the unit price
has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the amount of the commitments will not significantly differ
from the principal amount. The fund holds, and maintains until
settlement date, cash or high-grade debt obligations in an amount
sufficient to meet the purchase price, or the fund may enter into
offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities it owns.
Income on the securities will not be earned until settlement date. TBA
purchase commitments may be considered securities themselves, and
involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased
declines prior to the settlement date, which risk is in addition to the
risk of decline in the value of the fund's other assets. Unsettled TBA
purchase commitments are valued at fair value of the underlying
securities, according to the procedures described under "Security
valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market" daily and the
change in market value is recorded by the fund as an  unrealized gain or
loss.

Although the fund will generally enter into TBA purchase commitments
with the intention of acquiring securities for its portfolio or for
delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, the fund may
dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if Putnam Management deems
it appropriate to do so.

K) TBA sale commitments The fund may enter into TBA sale commitments to
hedge its portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it
owns under delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale
commitments are not received until the contractual settlement date.
During the time a TBA sale commitment is outstanding, equivalent
deliverable securities, or an offsetting TBA purchase commitment
deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as "cover"
for the transaction.

Unsettled TBA sale commitments are valued at fair value of the
underlying securities, generally according to the procedures described
under "Security valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market"
daily and the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an
unrealized gain or loss. If the TBA sale commitment is closed through
the acquisition of an offsetting purchase commitment, the fund realizes
a gain or loss. If the fund delivers securities under the commitment,
the fund realizes a gain or a loss from the sale of the securities based
upon the unit price established at the date the commitment was entered
into. TBA sale commitments outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

L) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk
of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will
bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the cash
collateral. Income from securities lending is included in investment
income on the Statement of operations. At March 31, 2004, the value of
securities loaned amounted to $1,004,245. The fund received cash
collateral of $1,032,630 which is pooled with collateral of other Putnam
funds into 25 issuers of high grade short-term investments.

M) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), as amended.
Therefore, no provision has been made for federal taxes on income,
capital gains or unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for
excise tax on income and capital gains.

At September 30, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of
$139,616,926 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future
capital gains, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration
dates are:

Loss Carryover   Expiration
- -----------------------------------
    $2,792,982   September 30, 2004
     1,554,563   September 30, 2005
    10,039,981   September 30, 2007
    25,640,537   September 30, 2008
    24,593,458   September 30, 2009
    27,431,170   September 30, 2010
    47,564,235   September 30, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending September 30, 2004, $3,314,449 of losses recognized during the
period November 1, 2002 to September 30, 2003.

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $741,433,623, resulting
in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $45,426,861 and
$35,190,515, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of
$10,236,346.

N) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.


Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the following annual rates: 0.75% of the first $500 million
of average weekly net assets, 0.65% of the next $500 million, 0.60% of
the next $500 million, and 0.55% thereafter.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor serving agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended March 31, 2004, the
fund paid PFTC $367,504 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended March 31, 2004,
the fund's expenses were reduced by $24,133 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $1,175, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund,
and an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees
receive additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
Statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the Statement of assets
and liabilities.


Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended March 31, 2004, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than U.S. government
securities and short-term investments aggregated $314,329,693 and
$384,817,207, respectively. Purchases and sales of U.S. government
securities aggregated $57,537,974 and $6,182,166, respectively.


Note 4
Regulatory matters and litigation

On April 8, 2004, Putnam Management entered into agreements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities
Division representing a final settlement of all charges brought against
Putnam Management by those agencies on October 28, 2003 in connection
with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees and, in the case
of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities Division, by
participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans. The settlement
with the SEC requires Putnam Management to pay $5 million in
disgorgement plus a civil monetary penalty of $50 million, and the
settlement with the Massachusetts Securities Division requires Putnam
Management to pay $5 million in restitution and an administrative fine
of $50 million. The settlements also leave intact the process
established under an earlier partial settlement with the SEC under which
Putnam Management agreed to pay the amount of restitution determined by
an independent consultant, which may exceed the disgorgement and
restitution amounts specified above, pursuant to a plan to be  developed
by the independent consultant.

Putnam Management, and not the investors in any Putnam fund, will bear
all costs, including restitution, civil penalties and associated legal
fees stemming from both of these proceedings. The SEC's and
Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and related matters also
serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits, including purported
class action lawsuits filed against Putnam Management and certain
related parties, including certain Putnam funds. Putnam Management has
agreed to bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in connection with
these lawsuits. Based on currently available information, Putnam
Management believes that the likelihood that the pending private
lawsuits and purported class action lawsuits will have a material
adverse financial impact on the fund is remote, and the pending actions
are not likely to materially affect its ability to provide investment
management services to its clients, including the Putnam funds.

Review of these matters by counsel for Putnam Management and by separate
independent counsel for the Putnam funds and their independent Trustees
is continuing.

Item 9. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders:

        Not applicable

Item 10. Controls and Procedures:
- ---------------------------------

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded, based on their evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of
the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, that the design and
operation of such procedures are generally effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
the investment company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms.

Although such officers reached the conclusion expressed in the
preceding paragraph, they are aware of matters that raise concerns
with respect to controls, each of which arose in connection with the
administration of 401(k) plans by Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company.
The first matter, which occurred in early 2001, involved the willful
circumvention of controls by certain Putnam employees in connection
with the correction of operational errors with respect to a 401(k)
client's investment in certain Putnam Funds, which led to losses in
five Putnam Funds (not including the registrant). Such officers
became aware of this matter in February 2004. The second matter,
which occurred in 2002, involved the willful circumvention by
certain Putnam employees of policies and procedures in connection
with the payment of Putnam corporate expenses. Such officers did
not learn that this matter involved a Putnam Fund until January
2004. Putnam has made restitution to the affected Funds,
implemented a number of personnel changes, including senior
personnel, begun to implement changes in procedures to address these
items and informed the SEC, the Funds' Trustees and independent
auditors. An internal investigation and review of procedures and
controls are currently ongoing.

In reaching the conclusion expressed herein, the registrant's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer
considered a number of factors, including the nature of the matters
described above, when the matters occurred, the individuals
involved, personnel changes that have occurred since these matters
occurred, the results to date of the current ongoing investigation
and the overall quality of controls at Putnam at this time.
