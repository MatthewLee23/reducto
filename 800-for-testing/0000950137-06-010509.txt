PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an early withdrawal
charge of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to zero
after year five), an early withdrawal charge of 1.00 percent for Class C shares
in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of up to 0.25
percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C shares and a
service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Effective 2/18/05,
contingent deferred sales charges for Class IB and Class IC shares are waived.
New investments are not available in Class IB and IC shares. Figures shown above
assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has waived or
reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

Fund Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

The 12-month period ended July 31, 2006 was quite favorable for the senior loan
asset class. Economic growth was solid, inflation remained in check, and the
credit market showed overall strength with many corporations posting good
profits, increasing revenues and improving credit quality. In addition, interest
rates continued to climb as the Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") raised
the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its meetings during
the reporting period, bringing the target rate to 5.25 percent at the end of
June 2006. The rising-rate environment was particularly beneficial to the senior
loan market as the yields on the loans adjust in tandem to short-term interest
rates.

Yield spreads in the senior loan market were relatively steady during the first
half of the reporting year, then began to widen in March. These widening spreads
in the latter half of the period added to the attractiveness of senior loans,
spurring demand from both institutional and individual investors.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 4.39 percent for the 12 months ended July 31, 2006 (Class A
shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

The performance for the five share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

We continued to follow our research-intensive investment approach, seeking to
balance yield with a stable net asset value. Our investment process remained
focused on identifying companies with strong management, solid and predictable
cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of default.

Throughout the reporting period, we maintained a high level of diversification
within the portfolio and continued to employ a bottom-up security selection
process driven by analysis of individual company fundamentals. We do, however,
analyze overall sector and industry trends as well, which led us to position the
fund somewhat defensively during the period. For example, we favored investments
in less cyclical sectors such as food and drug, cable, leisure

 2
<PAGE>

and entertainment, and the defense industry. These sectors have experienced
steady demand for goods and services. In addition, we generally avoided
investing in companies that we believed to be vulnerable to cyclical economic
downturns or rising fuel prices, particularly the auto and airline industries.
We also remained cautious about the health care sector, which has been
struggling due to reductions in Medicaid reimbursements.

In June, shareholders approved the use of leverage in the fund in an effort to
enhance the fund's dividend. We were able to immediately begin employing that
leverage, which involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate and reinvesting
the proceeds at a higher rate. The Fund may experience increased volatility as a
result of the use of leverage. We might reduce leverage in periods of weaker
credit quality conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the fund's net asset
value.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform well
or that securities in such sectors will be held by the fund in the future.

Expense Example

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments of Class A Shares
and contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions of Class B and Class C
Shares; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and
service (12b-1) fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended to help
you understand your ongoing cost (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period 2/1/06 - 7/31/06.

ACTUAL EXPENSE

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing cost of
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales
charges (loads) or contingent deferred sales charges. Therefore, the second line
of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you
determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if
these transactional costs were included, your cost would have been higher.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 22, 2006, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. Finally, the Board considered materials it had received in
approving recent changes in the Fund's fundamental investment policies regarding
financial leverage and periodic repurchase offers. The Board of Trustees
considered the contract over a period of several months and the non-management
trustees held sessions both with the investment adviser and separate from the
investment adviser in reviewing and considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
existing and alternative breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee
schedule. The Board of Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund
and other investment companies and/or other products at different asset levels,
and considered the trends in the industry versus historical and projected assets
of the Fund. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the investment
adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the Fund. The
Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees,

<PAGE>

evaluated all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group
of factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The Fund
discloses information about its portfolio management team members and their
experience in its prospectus. The trustees also discuss certain other services
which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the investment adviser or
its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain accounting,
administrative and legal services. The Board has determined that the nature,
extent and quality of the services provided by the investment adviser support
its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report and in
the Fund's prospectus. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser the
level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to comparable funds and other
products advised by the adviser and others in the marketplace. The trustees
review not only the advisory fees but other fees and expenses (whether paid to
the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The
Fund discloses more information about its fees and expenses in its prospectus.
The Board has determined that the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund
support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The trustees
discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses, including among
other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio management-related
expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated expenses both on an
aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that the analysis of the
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
and growth prospects of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense
ratio and particularly the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its
review of the investment adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the
investment adviser how more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or
effectiveness of managing the Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee
level is appropriate relative to current and projected asset levels and/or
whether the advisory fee structure reflects economies of scale as asset levels
change. The Board has determined that its review of the actual and potential
economies of scale of the Fund support its decision to approve the investment
advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

(b)  This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c)  Affiliated company. (See Notes to Financial Statements.)

(d)  This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e)  This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f)  Payment-in-kind security.

(g)  Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
     2006.

(h)  Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
     declare dividends.

(i)  Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
     senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
     deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time,
     the company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated
     with registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents
     1.0% of the net assets of the Fund.

(j)  The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
     this loan.

(k)  Subsequent to July 31, 2006, this borrower has filed for protection in
     federal bankruptcy court.

(l)  144A securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule
     144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only
     be resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
     transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(m)  Security purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

*    Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
     and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment
     conditions and because there may be significant economic incentives for a
     Borrower to prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may
     occur. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in
     the Fund's portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities
     shown. Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual
     remaining maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the
     actual average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
     approximately 18-24 months.

**   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates
     which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate
     plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
     offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
     Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
     United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
     are generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
     contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
     Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

**  Non-Annualized

(a) Based on average shares outstanding.

(b) Assumes reinvestment of all distributions for the period and does not
    include payment of the maximum sales charge of 3.25% or early withdrawal
    charge. On purchases of $1 million or more, an early withdrawal charge of 1%
    may be imposed on certain repurchases by the Fund made within eighteen
    months of purchase. If the sales charges were included, total returns would
    be lower. These returns include combined distribution and service fees of up
    to .25% and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would
    pay on Fund distributions or the repurchases by the Fund of Fund shares.

(c) Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
    variable rate senior loan interests.

(d) Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
    Borrowings) from the Fund's total assets and dividing by the total number of
    senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
    indebtedness.

    include payment of the maximum early withdrawal charge of 3%, charged on

    and service fees of up to 1% and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that
    a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the repurchases by the Fund
    of Fund shares.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2006

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. The Fund continuously offers Class A
Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares
are not continuously offered. Each class of shares differs by its initial sales
load, contingent deferred sales charges, the allocation of class-specific
expenses and voting rights on matters affecting a single class.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Fund
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Fund's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and notes
for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of
such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available,
Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent market
indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing sources
approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the
Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until the next interest rate
redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loans. Consideration of
comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of
deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have adjustment periods
comparable to the Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior
Loans are reviewed and approved by the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of
Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified

                                                                              47

price. Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt
security. The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical
delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian
bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at
not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses. The Fund
may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis,
with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased
is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Fund will segregate
assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount
of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until payment is
made. At July 31, 2006, the Fund had $1,500,00 of when-issued or delayed
delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2006, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $1,049,335,119, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Fund declares daily and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are
distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book
purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary
income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended July 31, 2006
and 2005 were as follows:

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between financial and tax basis reporting for the 2006 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. A permanent difference relating to the portion of capital loss
carryforward expiring in the current year totaling $230,325 was reclassified
from accumulated net realized loss to capital. Also, a permanent difference of
$2,869,644 relating to book to tax amortization differences were reclassified
from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss. Lastly, a permanent book and tax basis difference relating to currency
gains totaling $167 was reclassified from accumulated net realized loss to
accumulated undistributed net investment income.

    As of July 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $5,015,308
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses related to wash sale
transactions and post October losses which may not be recognized for tax
purposes until the first day of the following fiscal year.

F. CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES During the year ended July 31, 2006, the
Fund's custody fee was reduced by $87,117 as a result of credits earned on cash
balances.

                                                                              49

    In addition, the Fund will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen

    For the year ended July 31, 2006, the Fund recognized expenses of

firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Fund.

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Employment
agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides compliance
services to the Fund. The costs of these services are allocated to each fund.

31, 2006, the Fund recognized expenses of approximately $1,509,100 representing
transfer agency fees paid to VKIS. Transfer agency fees are determined through
negotiations with the Fund's Board of Trustees.

    Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Van Kampen. The Fund does not compensate its officers or Trustees who are also

    The Fund provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
Trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, Trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each Trustee's years of service to the Fund.
The maximum annual benefit per Trustee under the plan is $2,500.

    For the year ended July 31, 2006, Van Kampen, as Distributor for the Fund,
received commissions on sales of the Fund's Class A Shares of approximately

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the costs of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $1,712,763,818 and
$1,913,822,121, respectively.

5. REPURCHASE OF SHARES

The Fund adopted the following fundamental policies in relation to its
repurchase offers, which cannot be changed without the approval of the holders
of a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares: the Fund has a policy of making
periodic repurchase offers ("Repurchase Offers") for the Fund's common shares
pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"); Repurchase Offers have been made at quarterly intervals.

    On June 23, 2006, the shareholders of the Fund approved an amendment to the
Fund's fundamental policy regarding the Fund's offer to repurchase its shares to
allow the Fund to repurchase its shares on a monthly basis. In addition, on June
7, 2006, the Fund obtained exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to enable the Fund to conduct

                                                                              53
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2006 continued

monthly repurchase offers, subject to certain conditions. The Fund expects to
begin conducting monthly offers to repurchase its outstanding shares commencing
in October 2006.

    The Repurchase Offers will continue to be for between 5% and 25% of the
Fund's outstanding shares; however, whereas the Fund's present intent for
quarterly offers was 15%, the Fund's present intent for monthly offers is 5%
(although the initial one or more monthly repurchase offers may be for more than
5%, provided, however, the aggregate percentage of common shares subject to
repurchase in any 3-month period will not exceed 25%). The repurchase request
deadline will be the third Friday of each calendar month (or the preceding
business day if such third Friday is not a business day). To accommodate doing
monthly Repurchase Offers, the Fund will have shorter notice periods before each
offer and shorter payment periods after each offer. During the year ended July
31, 2006, the Fund made four Repurchase offers pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) as
follows: During the Repurchase Offer period ended October 21, 2005 (the Request
Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up to 15% of the aggregate of its
outstanding shares and the total amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer
amounted to 16,604,499 shares or 6.8% of the Fund's outstanding shares. During
the Repurchase Offer period ended January 20, 2006 (the Request Deadline), the
Fund offered to repurchase up to 15% of the aggregate of its outstanding shares
and the total amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer amounted to 15,457,719
shares or 6.7% of the Fund's outstanding shares. During the Repurchase Offer
period ended April 21, 2006 (the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to
repurchase up to 15% of the aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total
amount tendered in such Repurchase Offer amounted to 14,903,271 shares or 6.8%
of the Fund's outstanding shares. During the Repurchase Offer period ended July
21, 2006 (the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up to 15% of the
aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total amount tendered in such
Repurchase Offer amounted to 14,655,798 shares or 6.9% of the Fund's outstanding
shares.

6. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $118,293,322 as of July 31, 2006. The
Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,009,751 as of July 31, 2006 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

7. BORROWINGS

The Fund entered into a revolving credit and security agreement dated November
13, 2003 for an aggregate of $300,000,000, which was terminated on July 14,
2006. The proceeds of any borrowing by the Fund under this revolving credit
agreement was used for temporary liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder
repurchases.

    On June 23, 2006, the shareholders of the Fund approved the amendment of the
Fund's fundamental policy regarding the Fund's use of financial leverage to
allow the Fund to use leverage to the maximum extent allowable under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As of July 14, 2006, the Fund
entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement
(which in effect replaces the Fund's existing Revolving Credit and Security
Agreement dated November 13, 2003 as described above).

<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2006 continued

    Under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, the
Fund may borrow up to $700 million and the purposes of any advances under the
amended facility include financing the repurchases of shares and/or borrowing
for investment purposes. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the
assets of the Fund.

    Annual commitment fees of .13% were charged on the unused portion of both
credit lines. For the year ended July 31, 2006, the Fund recognized commitment
fee expenses of approximately $596,100. For the year ended July 31, 2006, when
in use, the average daily balance of borrowings under the Revolving Credit and
Security Agreement dated November 13, 2003 was $88,514,970 with a weighted
average interest rate of 4.31%. For the year ended July 31, 2006, when in use,
the average daily balance of borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit and Security Agreement dated July 14, 2006, was $125,000,000 with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.39%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At July 31, 2006, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.

9. DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN

Shares of the Fund are distributed by Van Kampen Funds, Inc. ("the
Distributor"), an affiliate of the Adviser. The Fund has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class
B Shares and Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, as amended, as if the Fund were an open-end investment
company. The Fund also has adopted a service plan (the "Service Plan") with
respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class
IC Shares. There is no Distribution Plan or Service Plan for the Class IB Shares
and no Distribution Plan for the Class IC Shares. All service fees under the
Service Plan applicable to Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and
Class IC Shares are currently being waived. For the year ended July 31, 2006,
the Distributor waived service fees of $951,571. This waiver is voluntary in
nature and can be discontinued at any time. Under the Distribution Plan and
Service Plan, the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and
distribution of its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of
ongoing services to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of
shareholder accounts.

                                                                              55
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2006 continued

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average
daily net assets of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC
Shares, respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the
aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75%, 0.75%, and
0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for Class A Shares, Class B
Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares, respectively. Annual fees under the
Distribution Plan and Service Plan are accrued daily. The net annual fees for
Class B and Class C Shares are paid monthly to the Distributor. The amount of
distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet reimbursed
("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $222,400 and $149,300 for Class B
and Class C Shares, respectively. These amounts may be recovered from future
payments under the distribution plan. To the extent the unreimbursed receivable
has been fully recovered, any excess fees will be refunded to the Fund on a
quarterly basis.

10. LITIGATION

On September 28, 2001 and October 11, 2001, separate complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois each by a
shareholder of the Fund against the Fund, the Adviser, Van Kampen Funds Inc. and
certain directors and officers of the Fund. The respective complaints, framed as
class actions, alleged misstatements and omissions in the Fund's registration
statements in violation of the federal securities laws. The separate complaints
were consolidated on or about December 15, 2001, and the class was certified on
or about August 26, 2002. The consolidated action was entitled Abrams et al. v.
Van Kampen Funds, Inc., et al., No. 01 C 7538 (N.D. Ill., Hart J.). On June 3,
2005, the Court preliminarily approved a pretrial settlement of this class
action in the amount of $31,500,000. A fairness hearing on the settlement was
held on November 16, 2005. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Fund
is not responsible for the settlement amount. On January 20, 2006, the Court
approved a settlement and the cause of action was dismissed with prejudice.

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation
of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before
being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact to the Fund's financial
statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments, as
of July 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
owned as of July 31, 2006, by correspondence with the Fund's custodian, brokers,
and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund as of July 31, 2006, the results of its operations, its
cash flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Fund or a third
party.

(b) No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has three "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, "independent" Trustees Rod
Dammeyer, Jerry D. Choate and R. Craig Kennedy. Under applicable securities
laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee financial expert will
not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose, including without limitation for the
purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being
designated or identified as an audit committee financial expert. The designation
or identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert does not

than the duties, obligations, and liabilities imposed on such person as a member
of the audit committee and Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation
or identification.

from the Fund.(2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

2.   DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.   AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4.   AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.   TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.   ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.   PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.   PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.  COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Asset Management

     -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Fund has a separately-designated standing audit committee established in
accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are: David
C. Arch, Rod Dammeyer, Howard J Kerr, Hugo F. Sonnenschein.

(b) Not applicable.

Item 6. Schedule of Investments.

Please refer to Item #1.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Fund's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are
as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.   POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies under this Policy (except for the Morgan Stanley KLD
Social Index Fund, which votes proxies pursuant to the Institutional Shareholder
Services' Social Investment Research Proxy Voting Guidelines) pursuant to
authority granted under its applicable investment advisory agreement or, in the
absence of such authority, as authorized by the Board of

<PAGE>

Directors or Trustees of the MSIM Funds. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies
if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for
itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the investment
management or investment advisory agreement does not authorize the MSIM
Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in a prudent and diligent
manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients, including beneficiaries
of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for which the MSIM Affiliates
manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term investment
returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or its
fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a proxy voting policy. In these
situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's policy.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.

II.  GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that arise most
frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in accordance with the
following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the Proxy Review
Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. Morgan Stanley AIP
GP LP will follow the procedures as described in Appendix A. A MSIM Affiliate
will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the
record date and the meeting date.

<PAGE>

III. GUIDELINES

A. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS. The following proposals will generally be voted
as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     i. General.

     1.   Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
          following are examples of routine management proposals:

          -    Approval of financial statements, director and auditor reports.

          -    General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

          -    Proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, except
               those proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
               business which may come before the meeting."

     2.   Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be supported;
          proposals to establish cumulative voting in the election of directors
          will not be supported.

     3.   Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent tabulation of
          voting results will be supported.

     4.   Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman and CEO
          will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S. companies to have
          a separate Chairman and CEO will be supported.

     5.   Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items that are
          clearly related to the regular course of business will be supported.

     6.   Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will be
          supported.

     7.   Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be supported.
          However, where management specifically states the reason for
          requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment is necessary
          to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this
          Policy to be carried out (i.e. an uncontested corporate transaction),
          the adjournment request will be supported.

     8.   Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management supports
          a classified board) generally will not be supported.

     9.   Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are costly to
          provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditures that
          are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent information
          from the perspective of institutional shareholders generally will not
          be supported.

     ii. Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists and where
     no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless otherwise
     determined by the

<PAGE>

     Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be voted in support of nominees of
     management.

     1. The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%) of
               the company's board members be independent directors.

          -    Proposals requiring that members of the company's compensation,
               nominating and audit committees be comprised of independent or
               unaffiliated directors.

     2. Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a withhold
     vote will be made in the following circumstances:

          (a)  If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
               disinsterested directors, a withhold vote will be made for
               interested directors. A director nominee may be deemed to be
               interested if the nominee has, or any time during the previous
               five years had, a relationship with the issuer (e.g., investment
               banker, counsel or other professional service provider, or
               familial relationship with a senior officer of the issuer) that
               may impair his or her independence;

          (b)  If a nominee who is interested is standing for election as a
               member of the company's compensation, nominating or audit
               committees;

          (c)  A direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee and
               the public shareholders;

          (d)  Where the nominees standing for election have not taken action to
               implement generally accepted governance practices for which there
               is a "bright line" test. These would include elimination of dead
               hand or slow hand poison pills, requiring audit, compensation or
               nominating committees to be composed of independent directors and
               requiring a majority independent board;

          (e)  A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings
               within a given year without a reasonable excuse; or

          (f)  A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than six
               companies (excluding investment companies).

     iii. Auditors

     1.   Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification of
          auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not be
          supported if the fees paid to auditors are excessive. Generally, to
          determine if such fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied:
          i.e., non-audit fees should be less than 50% of the total fees paid to
          the auditor.

<PAGE>

     2.   Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
          shareholders will be supported.

     3.   Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

     iv. Anti-Takeover Matters

     1.   Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
          requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
          proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority shareholder vote
          to pass or repeal certain provisions will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail provisions will
          be supported, provided that the proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii)
          prohibits buyback offers to large block holders (holders of at least
          1% of the outstanding shares and in certain cases, a greater amount,
          as determined by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all
          shareholders or not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii)
          contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
          rights of shareholders.

     3.   Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
          shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.

B. CAPITALIZATION CHANGES. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that eliminate other
               classes of stock and/or eliminate unequal voting rights.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
               common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
               (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii) the
               number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to the
               purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii) the
               authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently authorized
               and at least 30% of the new authorization will be outstanding.

          -    Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
               issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

          -    Proposals for share repurchase plans.

          -    Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common or
               preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred stock.

          -    Proposals to effect stock splits.

          -    Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
               proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in
               the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
               proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be
               approved if the resulting increase in

<PAGE>

               authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set forth
               above for common stock increases.

     2.   The following proposals generally will not be supported
          (notwithstanding management support).

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add classes of
               stock which substantially dilute the voting interests of existing
               shareholders.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of existing
               classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or supervoting
               rights.

          -    Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

          -    Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

C. COMPENSATION. The following proposals generally will be voted as indicated
below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts are not
               excessive relative to other companies in the country or industry.

          -    Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts
               up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based
               employee plan, including all non-executive employees.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee stock option plans
               and other employee ownership plans, provided that our research
               does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against
               shareholder interest.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
               severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
               that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.

     2.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
          agreements will not be supported, however, proposals that require
          shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
          annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.

     3.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive
          compensation generally will not be supported.

     4.   Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive compensation
          in addition to the disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission ("SEC") regulations generally will not be supported.

D. OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

<PAGE>

     1.   Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
          environmental or special interest issues that do not relate directly
          to the business of the company and which do not appear to be directed
          specifically to the business or financial interest of the company
          generally will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are not
          required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate will
          not be supported.

E. ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     i. Corporate Transactions

          -    Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special
               corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of
               assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations)
               will be examined on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Research
               Providers' research and analysis will be used along with MSIM
               Affiliates' research and analysis, including, among other things,
               MSIM internal company-specific knowledge. Proposals for mergers
               or other significant transactions that are friendly and approved
               by the Research Providers generally will be supported where there
               is no portfolio manager objection and where there is no material
               conflict of interest and in those instances will not need to be
               reviewed by the Proxy Review Committee.

     ii. Compensation

          -    Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in non-salary
               compensation plans, employment contracts, and severance
               agreements that benefit management and would be costly to
               shareholders if triggered. With respect to proposals related to
               severance and change of control situations, MSIM Affiliates will
               support a maximum of three times salary and bonus.

          -    Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option plans.
               Generally, stock option plans should be incentive based. The
               Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the quantitative
               criteria used by a Research Provider when considering such
               Research Provider's recommendation. If the Proxy Review Committee
               determines that the criteria used by the Research Provider is
               reasonable, the proposal will be supported if it falls within a
               5% band above the Research Provider's threshold.

          -    Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock options
               that have not been offered to employees in general.

     iii. Other

          -    Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

<PAGE>

          -    Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring specific
               levels of stock ownership by directors.

          -    Proposals for election of directors, where a director nominee is
               related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management) must be
               considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the proposal relates
               to a director nominee who is on a Van Kampen Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees, to the extent that the shares of the relevant
               company are held by a Van Kampen Fund, the Van Kampen Board shall
               vote the proxies with respect to those shares, to the extent
               practicable. In the event that the Committee cannot contact the
               Van Kampen Board in advance of the shareholder meeting, the
               Committee will vote such shares pursuant to the Proxy Voting
               Policy.

          -    Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating to
               broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

          -    Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
               indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
               Committee will support such proposals provided that the officers
               and directors are eligible for indemnification and liability
               protection if they have acted in good faith on company business
               and were found innocent of any civil or criminal charges for
               duties performed on behalf of the company.

F. FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

IV.  ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A.   PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

     1.   The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
          creating and implementing the Policy and, in this regard, has
          expressly adopted it.

          (a)  The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief Investment
               Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior investment professionals who
               represent the different investment disciplines and geographic
               locations of the firm. The Committee is responsible for
               establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM will vote
               proxies on an ongoing basis.

          (b)  The Committee will periodically review and have the authority to
               amend, as necessary, the Policy and establish and direct voting
               positions consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

          (c)  The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
               matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to the
               Policy and (2) review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings
               of MSIM portfolio

<PAGE>

               companies in accordance with this Policy including, as
               appropriate, the voting results of prior shareholder meetings of
               the same issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
               shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will timely
               communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments to them
               and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

          (d)  The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
               matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain
               shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the same proxy
               solicitation and held by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
               differently than other shares) and/or "override voting" (i.e.,
               voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the
               Policy); (2) review and approve upcoming votes, as appropriate,
               for matters for which specific direction has been provided in
               this Policy; and (3) determine how to vote matters for which
               specific direction has not been provided in this Policy. Split
               votes generally will not be approved within a single Global
               Investor Group investment team. The Committee may take into
               account Research Providers' recommendations and research as well
               as any other relevant information they may request or receive,
               including portfolio manager and/or analyst research, as
               applicable. Generally, proxies related to securities held in
               accounts that are managed pursuant to quantitative, index or
               index-like strategies ("Index Strategies") will be voted in the
               same manner as those held in actively managed accounts. Because
               accounts managed using Index Strategies are passively managed
               accounts, research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
               related to securities held in these accounts may not be
               available. If the affected securities are held only in accounts
               that are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and the proxy
               relates to a matter that is not described in this Policy, the
               Committee will consider all available information from the
               Research Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
               significant, from the portfolio managers and/or analysts.

          (e)  In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the Committee
               determines that an issue raises a potential material conflict of
               interest, or gives rise to the appearance of a potential material
               conflict of interest, the Committee will request a special
               committee to review, and recommend a course of action with
               respect to, the conflict(s) in question ("Special Committee").
               The Special Committee shall be comprised of the Chairperson of
               the Proxy Review Committee, the Compliance Director for the area
               of the firm involved or his/her designee, a senior portfolio
               manager (if practicable, one who is a member of the Proxy Review
               Committee) designated by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's
               Chief Investment Officer or his/her designee. The Special
               Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's General Counsel or
               his/her designee and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In
               addition to the research provided by Research Providers, the
               Special Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate
               investment professionals and outside sources to the extent it
               deems appropriate.

<PAGE>

          (f)  The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s),
               will document in writing all of their decisions and actions,
               which documentation will be maintained by the Committee and the
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of at least
               6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a security held
               by a MSIM U.S. registered investment company, the Committee and
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
               decisions to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those
               investment companies at each Board's next regularly scheduled
               Board meeting. The report will contain information concerning
               decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during the
               most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding the
               Board meeting.

          (g)  The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s), will
               timely communicate to applicable portfolio managers, the
               Compliance Departments and, as necessary, to ISS, decisions of
               the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
               ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

B.   IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     1.   If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a material conflict
          of interest, the vote must be decided by the Special Committee in
          consultation with MSIM's General Counsel or his/her designee.

     2.   A material conflict of interest could exist in the following
          situations, among others:

     (a)  The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an affiliate of
          MSIM and the vote is on a material matter affecting the issuer;

     (b)  The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other security
          issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates; or

     (c)  Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
          submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a party
          to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will be paid a
          success fee if completed).

C.   PROXY VOTING REPORTS

     (a)  MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client
          requesting them. MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly provide
          a report indicating how each proxy was voted with respect to
          securities held in that client's account.

     (b)  MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an annual Form N-PX
          on behalf of each registered management investment company for which
          such filing is required, indicating how all proxies were voted with
          respect to such investment company's holdings.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                           VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Fund is managed by
members of the Taxable Fixed Income team. The team consists of portfolio
managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio and the
overall execution of the strategy of the Fund are Howard T. Tiffen, a Managing
Director of the Adviser and Christina Jamieson, an Executive Director of the
Adviser.

Mr. Tiffen has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since December 1999 and began managing the Fund in December 1999. Ms.
Jamieson has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since March 2000 and began managing the Fund in June 2005.

The composition of the team may change from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

The following information is as of July 31, 2006.

As of July 31, 2006, Mr. Tiffen managed 6 mutual funds with a total of
approximately $5.7 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds; and 2 other accounts with a total of approximately $585.2 million
in assets.

As of June 30, 2006, Ms. Jamieson managed two mutual funds with a total of
approximately $4.0 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio manager may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies and procedures
that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of
interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all funds/accounts managed by the portfolio
manager.

Base salary compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

<PAGE>

- -    Cash Bonus.

- -    Morgan Stanley's Equity Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation into restricted stock units or other awards based on Morgan
     Stanley common stock that are subject to vesting and other conditions.

- -    Investment Management Deferred Compensation Plan (IMDCP) awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation and notionally invests it in designated Funds advised by the
     Adviser or its affiliates. The award is subject to vesting and other
     conditions. Portfolio managers must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a
     maximum of 75% of the IMDCP deferral into a combination of the designated
     open-end mutual funds they manage that are included in the IMDCP Fund menu,
     which may or may not include the Fund.

- -    Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
     certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary
     year-end compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred
     amount: (1) across a range of designated investment Funds, including Funds
     advised by the Adviser or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley
     stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- -    Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
     pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the
     portfolio manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three-
     and five-year periods measured against a fund's/account's primary
     benchmark, indices and/or peer groups where applicable. Generally, the
     greatest weight is placed on the three- and five-year periods.

- -    Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles
     and other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- -    The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- -    Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- -    Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and
     the overall performance of the investment team(s) of which the portfolio
     manager is a member.

           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

                AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2005

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.
