                                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members' capital, including the schedule
of investments, and the related statements of operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and
the financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Grosvenor
Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the "Company", formerly Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge
Fund, LLC) at March 31, 2010, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments at March 31, 2010 by correspondence with the custodian and underlying portfolio
funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

*    The Company  reorganized into a  "master/feeder"  structure during this period.  See Note 2c and Note 7 for further
     explanation of the change in expense structure for fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, as compared to prior years.

(a)  Average  Members'  Capital is determined by using the net assets at the end of each month during the period and net
     assets at the beginning of the period.

(b)  Ratio does not reflect the Company's proportionate share of the net income (loss) and expenses, including incentive
     fees or allocations,  of the Portfolio  Funds.  The Portfolio  Funds' expense ratios,  excluding  incentive fees or
     allocations,  range from 0.51% to 11.22% (unaudited).  The Portfolio Funds' incentive fees or allocations can be up
     to 20% of profits earned (unaudited).

(c)  Calculated based on the amount reallocated to the Special Members for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31,
     2009.

(d)  Calculated  based on the amount  reallocable to the Special Members for the period  indicated,  had the measurement
     period for incentive allocation closed on the dates indicated (not annualized).

(e)  Total  return  assumes a purchase  of an  interest in the Company on the first day and a sale of an interest on the
     last day of the period and is calculated by using  geometrically  linked monthly  returns.  An individual  Member's
     return may vary from these returns based on the timing of Member subscriptions and redemptions.

(f)  The ratio excludes in-kind transactions.

1. ORGANIZATION

Grosvenor Registered  Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC, formerly known as Columbia Management  Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund,
LLC (the "Company"),  is a Delaware limited  liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end  management  investment  company and is operating as a diversified  investment
company. The primary investment objectives of the Company are to provide investors: (i) an attractive, long-term rate of
return,  on an absolute basis as well as a  risk-adjusted  basis;  (ii) low  performance  volatility;  and (iii) minimal
correlation with the equity and fixed income markets.  The Company employs a  multi-strategy,  multi-manager  investment
strategy premised on the risk control benefits of  diversification  and the value of a hedged investment  approach.  The
Company seeks  diversification  by investing in partnerships and other investment  vehicles (the "Portfolio Funds") that
(i)  pursue  non-traditional  investment  strategies  and (ii) are  expected  to  exhibit a low  degree  of  performance
correlation,  not only with broad market indices but also with each other. These Portfolio Funds are managed by selected
investment managers ("Investment Managers") who specialize in the chosen strategies.  There can be no assurance that the
investment objective of the Company will be achieved.

On January 1, 2010, pursuant to member approval, the Company was reorganized into a "master/feeder" investment structure
(the  "Reorganization").  Effective  as of the close of business on that date,  the Company  became a master  fund,  and
members of the Company contributed their interests to a new entity, Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1), LLC
(the "TI 1 Fund"),  in exchange for interests in the TI 1 Fund. The TI 1 Fund in turn invested  substantially all of its
assets into the Company. The TI 1 Fund had no assets, liabilities,  or operations prior to the Reorganization.  The TI 1
Fund is a Delaware  limited  liability  company  that is  registered  under the 1940 Act as a  closed-end,  diversified,
management investment company.

The TI 1 Fund pursues its investment  objective by investing  substantially  all of its assets in the Company.  The TI 1
Fund has the same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies as the Company (except that the TI
1 Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in the Company).

Until March 31, 2010 (see Note 11 "Subsequent  Events"),  Banc of America Investment Advisors,  Inc. (the "Adviser") was
the investment adviser to the Company.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended (the  "Advisers  Act").  The Adviser is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Bank of America
Corporation  ("BAC"). BAC is a bank holding and a financial holding company which has its principal executive offices at
101 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Adviser has retained  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor" or the  "Subadviser") as subadviser to the
Company,  which is also  registered as an investment  adviser under the Advisers Act. The Subadviser is responsible  for
implementing the Company's investment strategy and managing the Company's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in
accordance with the investment objective,  philosophy and strategy described in the Company's registration statement and
subject to oversight by the Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company.


                                                                                                                      11

                                                     March 31, 2010

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

The Board has overall  responsibility  to manage and  supervise the  operations of the Company,  including the exclusive
authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the  management,  conduct and  operation  of the  Company's
business. The Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the day-to-day operations of the Company.

As of March 31, 2010, the TI 1 Fund's ownership of the Company's Members' Capital was 99.9%. The remaining 0.1% was held
by BACAP  Alternative  Advisors,  Inc.,  an affiliate  of the Adviser  ("BACAP"  and  together  with the TI 1 Fund,  the
"Members").

Member  subscriptions for interests in the Company  ("Interests") by eligible  investors may be accepted as of the first
day of each month. The Board may authorize the Adviser to offer Interests more or less frequently. The Company may, from
time to time, offer to repurchase  Interests from its Members  pursuant to written tenders by Members.  These repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole  discretion,  subject
to the liquidity of the Company's  assets and other factors  considered by the Board. The Adviser expects that generally
it will  recommend  to the Board that the Company  offer to  repurchase  Interests  from  Members  four times each year,
effective as of the last day of each  calendar  quarter.  Members can only  transfer or assign  Interests  under certain
limited circumstances.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("GAAP")  requires  management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial
statements are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could differ from these estimates.

B. CODIFICATION

In July 2009, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") implemented the FASB Accounting Standards  Codification
(the  "Codification")  as the single  source of GAAP.  While the  Codification  did not change GAAP, it introduced a new
structure to the accounting literature and changed references to accounting standards and other authoritative accounting
guidance.  The Codification was effective for the Company in 2009 and did not affect the Company's  Statement of Assets,
Liabilities and Members' Capital, Statement of Operations, Statement of Changes in Members' Capital or Statement of Cash
Flows.

C. COMPANY EXPENSES

The Company bears certain expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  fees paid
directly or indirectly to the investment  managers of the Portfolio  Funds;  all costs and expenses  directly related to
portfolio  transactions and positions for the Company's  account;  legal fees;  accounting and auditing fees;  custodial
fees; fees paid to the Company's administrator;  costs of insurance;  advisory fees; subadvisory out-of-pocket fees; the
fees and travel  expenses  and other  expenses of the Board;  all costs with  respect to  communications  regarding  the
Company's  transactions  between the Adviser and any custodian or other agent engaged by the Company; and other types of
expenses approved by the Board. Expenses, including incentive fees or allocations, of the underlying Portfolio Funds are
not included in the Statement of Operations.

D. INCOME TAXES

As a limited liability company,  no provision for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has been provided
by the Company.  Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its share of the Company's taxable
income or loss. The Company has a tax year end of December 31.

The cost of the Company's investments in Portfolio Funds for Federal income tax purposes is based on amounts reported to
the Company by the Portfolio Funds on a Schedule K-1. As of March 31, 2010, the Company has not received  information to
determine  the tax cost of the  Portfolio  Funds as of March 31, 2010.  Based on the amounts  reported to the Company on
Schedule K-1 as of December 31, 2009, and after  adjustment for purchases and redemptions  between December 31, 2009 and
March 31, 2010,  the estimated cost of the Portfolio  Funds at March 31, 2010 for federal tax purposes is  $409,873,373.
The  resulting  estimated  net  unrealized  appreciation  for tax purposes on the  Portfolio  Funds at March 31, 2010 is
$30,727,219.

The  authoritative  guidance on accounting for and disclosure of  uncertainty  in tax positions  requires  management to
determine  whether a tax position of the Company is "more likely than not" to be sustained upon  examination,  including
resolution  of any related  appeals or litigation  processes,  based on the  technical  merits of the position.  For tax
positions meeting the more likely than not threshold,  the tax amount recognized in the financial  statements is reduced
by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate  settlement with
the relevant taxing authority. Management analyzed all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all
major  jurisdictions and has determined that the adoption of this authoritative  guidance did not have a material effect
on the results of  operations  or  financial  position of the  Company.  The  Company has  determined  that there are no
unrecognized  tax benefits or liabilities  relating to uncertain  income tax positions  taken on prior years' returns or
expected to be taken on the tax return for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In connection with the  Reorganization  discussed in Note 1, the Investment  Adviser expects that Members of the Company
immediately prior to the Reorganization will not be subject to any tax as a result of the Reorganization.  For financial
reporting purposes, assets received and interests issued by the


                                                                                                                      13

TI 1 Fund were recorded at fair value.  The cost basis of the investments  received by the TI 1 Fund was carried forward
to align ongoing  reporting of the TI 1 Fund's realized gains and losses with amounts  distributable  to its members for
tax purposes.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in the Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund
and  redemptions  of  Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the last day of legal  ownership.  Redemptions  received  from
Portfolio Funds,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied first as a reduction of the investment's cost,
and any excess is treated as realized gain from investments in Portfolio Funds.  Realized gains or losses on investments
in Portfolio Funds are recorded at the time of the disposition of the respective investment on an average cost basis.

F. OTHER

Net  investment  income or loss and net realized and  unrealized  gain or loss from  investments of the Company for each
fiscal period are allocated  among,  and credited to or debited  against,  the capital accounts of all Members as of the
last day of the fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective  investment  percentage for the fiscal period,
as defined in the Company's Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Operating Agreement").

Cash and cash equivalents  consist of amounts  maintained in a PFPC Trust Company  interest-bearing  account and include
overnight  deposits in BlackRock  Liquidity  Funds,  Temp Fund, an affiliate of BAC.  Interest income is recorded on the
accrual basis.

G. FUTURES

From time to time, the Company may use futures primarily for tactical hedging purposes.  Initial margin deposits of cash
and  securities  are made upon entering  into futures  contracts.  The  contracts  are marked to market  monthly and the
resulting  changes in value are accounted  for as unrealized  gains and losses.  Variation  margin  payments are paid or
received,  depending  upon whether  unrealized  gains or losses are incurred.  When the contract is closed,  the Company
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference  between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing  transaction
and the amount invested in the contract.  Risks of entering into futures  contracts  include the possibility  that there
will be an imperfect price correlation between the futures and the underlying securities.  Second, it is possible that a
lack of  liquidity  for futures  contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting in an inability to close a
position prior to its maturity date. Third, the futures contract involves risk that the Company could lose more than the
original margin deposit required to initiate a futures transaction.

The risk exists that losses could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of  investments  or statement of assets and
liabilities. For the year ended March 31, 2010, the Company did not enter into any futures contracts.


                                                                                                                      14

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

H. OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the obligation,  to buy or sell a specified item at a fixed price during a
specified  period for a  nonrefundable  fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase of these  options  are  included  in the  statement  of assets,
liabilities and members' capital as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the value of the options,
with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included in the statement of operations.

If the Company were to purchase or write options, it would receive a premium and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in
the prices of the securities or index  instruments  underlying the options.  Premiums received from writing put and call
options which have not expired are presented in the  liabilities  section of the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and
members' capital and subsequently  adjusted to the current market value of the options written,  but not less than zero.
If the current market value of an option exceeds the premium received, the excess is recorded as an unrealized loss and,
conversely,  if the premium exceeds the current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an unrealized  gain.  The risk exists that losses could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of  investments or
statement  of assets and  liabilities.  For the year ended March 31,  2010,  the  Company did not  purchase or write any
options contracts.

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value (the "NAV") of the Company is determined  by, or at the direction of, the Adviser as of the close of
business at the end of each fiscal  period (as defined in the Company's  Operating  Agreement),  in accordance  with the
valuation  principles  set forth below,  or as may be  determined  from time to time,  pursuant to valuation  procedures
established  by the Board.  Pursuant to the  valuation  procedures,  the Board has  delegated to the Adviser the general
responsibility for valuation of the investments in the Portfolio Funds subject to the oversight by the Board.

The  investments  in the  Portfolio  Funds are  recorded at fair value,  generally  at an amount equal to the NAV of the
Company's investment in the Portfolio Funds as determined by the Portfolio Fund's general partner or investment manager.
If no such  information is available or if such  information is deemed to be not reflective of fair value,  an estimated
fair value is determined in good faith by the Adviser pursuant to the valuation procedures.  Generally,  the NAVs of the
investments  in the  Portfolio  Funds  are  determined  whereby  the  Company  records  the  investment  and  subsequent
subscriptions  at its  acquisition  cost which  represents  its fair value.  The  investment  is adjusted to reflect the
Company's  share of net investment  income or loss and unrealized and realized gain or loss that reflects the changes in
the fair value of the investment for the period.

The Portfolio Funds record their investments at fair value in accordance with GAAP or International  Financial Reporting
Standards. The Portfolio Funds generally hold positions in readily marketable securities and derivatives that are valued
at quoted market values and/or less liquid  nonmarketable  securities and derivatives  that are valued at estimated fair
value.  Accordingly,  valuations  do not  necessarily  represent  the amounts that might be realized from sales or other
dispositions of investments, nor do they reflect other


                                                                                                                      15

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

expenses  or fees that  might be  incurred  upon  disposition.  The mix and  concentration  of more  readily  marketable
securities  and less liquid  nonmarketable  securities  varies  across the  Portfolio  Funds  based on various  factors,
including the nature of their investment strategy and market forces.

Because of the inherent  uncertainty of valuations of the investments in the Portfolio Funds, their estimated values may
differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the Portfolio Funds existed,  and
the differences could be material. Net change in accumulated unrealized  appreciation on investments in the statement of
operations is net of fees and performance-based compensation paid to the investment managers of the Portfolio Funds.

Some of the Portfolio Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in illiquid securities and may hold a portion or
all of these investments independently from the main portfolio. These separate baskets of illiquid securities (the "side
pockets") may be subject to additional  restrictions  of liquidity than the main portfolio of the Portfolio Fund. If the
Company withdraws its interest from such a Portfolio Fund, it may be required to maintain its holding in the side pocket
investments for an extended period of time and retain this remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund. In instances, where
such a Portfolio  Fund closes its  operations,  the Company may receive an  "in-kind"  distribution  of a side  pocket's
holdings  in  liquidation  of its entire  interest  in the  Portfolio  Fund.  The value of side  pockets  may  fluctuate
significantly.  As of March 31, 2010, the Company's  investments in side pockets  represented 2.66% of the Company's net
assets.  Additionally,  the governing  documents of the Portfolio Funds  generally  provide that the Portfolio Funds may
suspend, limit or delay the right of their investors, such as the Company, to withdraw capital.  Restrictions applicable
to individual Portfolio Funds are described in detail on the Company's Schedule of Investments.

The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation  techniques used to measure fair value.
The objective of a fair value  measurement  is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date (an exit price).
Accordingly,  the fair value  hierarchy  gives the highest  priority to unadjusted  quoted prices in active  markets for
identical  assets or  liabilities  (level 1  measurements)  and the lowest  priority  to  unobservable  inputs  (Level 3
measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

     -    Level 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical,  unrestricted assets or liabilities that
          the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2 -- Quoted prices which are not considered to be active, or inputs that are observable (either directly
          or indirectly) for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

     -    Level 3 -- Prices,  inputs or modeling  techniques which are both  significant to the fair value  measurement
          and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The Company has adopted the  authoritative  guidance  under GAAP for  estimating  the fair value of  investments  in the
Portfolio  Funds that have  calculated  the NAV per share in accordance  with the  specialized  accounting  guidance for
investment companies. Accordingly, the Company estimates the


                                                                                                                      16

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

fair value of an investment in a Portfolio  Fund using the NAV of the  investment (or its  equivalent)  without  further
adjustment unless the Adviser  determines that the NAV is deemed to be not reflective of the fair value. The adoption of
this guidance does not have a material effect on the financial statements.

Investments may be classified as Level 2 when market information  (observable NAVs) is available,  yet the investment is
not traded in an active market and/or the investment is subject to transfer  restrictions,  or the valuation is adjusted
to reflect illiquidity and/or  non-transferability.  Market  information,  including  observable NAVs,  subscription and
redemption activity at the underlying Portfolio Fund, and the length of time until the investment will become redeemable
is  considered  when  determining  the proper  categorization  of the  investment's  fair value  measurement  within the
fair valuation  hierarchy.  Portfolio  Fund  investment  lots that have observable  market inputs  (published NAVs) and
that the Company has the ability to  redeem from within three months of the balance  sheet date are  classified  in the
fair value hierarchy as Level 2.

The Company's  investments in  the Portfolio Funds  that  have  unobservable  inputs and/or from which the Company does
not have the  ability to redeem  within  three months are  classified  in the  fair  value  hierarchy  as Level 3. When
observable  prices  are not  available for these  securities,  the Company uses the market approach,  as defined in the
authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, to evaluate the fair value of such Level 3 instruments.

The following table sets forth  information  about the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Portfolio Fund
investments are measured at March 31, 2010:

The Company adopted  authoritative  guidance that permits a reporting  entity to measure the fair value of an investment
that does not have a readily  determinable fair value, based on the NAV per share for the investment.  In using the NAV,
certain  attributes of the  investment  that may impact the fair value of the investment are not considered in measuring
fair value. Attributes of those investments include the investment strategies of the investees and may also include, but
are not limited to,  restrictions on the investor's  ability to redeem its  investments at the measurement  date and any
unfunded  commitments.  The  Company  is  permitted  to invest  in  alternative  investments  that do not have a readily
determinable fair value, and as such, has determined that the NAV, as calculated by the reporting entity, represents the
fair value of the  investments.  A listing of the investments  held by the Company and their  attributes as of March 31,
2010, that may qualify for these valuations are shown in the table below.

     *    The  information  summarized  in the table above  represents  the general  terms of the specific  asset class.
          Individual Portfolio Funds may have terms that are more or less restrictive that those terms indicated for the
          asset class as a whole. In addition, most Portfolio Funds have the flexibility, as provided for in constituent
          documents, to modify and waive such terms.

     **   Reflects fair value of investments in each respective investment category.

The Company's  investments  reflect their estimated fair value,  which for marketable  securities would generally be the
last sales price on the primary exchange for such security,  and for the Portfolio Funds,  would generally be the NAV as
provided by the Portfolio Fund or its  administrator.  For each of the categories below, the fair value of the Portfolio
Funds has been estimated using the net asset value of the Portfolio Funds.

(A)  DISTRESSED  SECURITIES  This  category  includes the Portfolio  Funds that invest in debt and equity  securities of
companies in financial  difficulty,  reorganization  or bankruptcy,  nonperforming  and  subperforming  bank loans,  and
emerging  market debt.  As of March 31, 2010,  the  Portfolio  Funds within this  strategy had unfunded  commitments  of
$508,631.

(B) EVENT DRIVEN This category  includes the Portfolio Funds that take  significant  positions in companies with special
situations,  including  distressed  stocks,  mergers  and  takeovers.  As of March  31,  2010,  there  were no  unfunded
commitments.

(C) LONG AND/OR SHORT EQUITIES This category includes the Portfolio Funds that make long and short investments in equity
securities that are deemed by the Investment  Managers to be under or overvalued.  The Investment  Managers typically do
not  attempt to  neutralize  the  amount of long and short  positions.  As of March 31,  2010,  there  were no  unfunded
commitments.


                                                                                                                      19

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

(D)  MULTI-ARBITRAGE  This category  includes the Portfolio Funds that seek to exploit price differences of identical or
similar financial  instruments,  on different markets or in different forms by simultaneously  purchasing and selling an
asset in order to profit from the difference. As of March 31, 2010, there were no unfunded commitments.

As of March 31, 2010, the Company had investments in 52 Portfolio Funds. The Company,  as an investor in these Portfolio
Funds is charged  management fees of up to 3% (per annum) of the NAV of its ownership  interests in the Portfolio Funds,
as well as incentive  fees or  allocations  of up to 20% of net profits  earned that are  attributable  to the Company's
ownership  interests in such Portfolio Funds. The Company also generally bears a pro rata share of the other expenses of
each Portfolio Fund in which it invests.  Total expenses,  including incentive fees or allocations,  for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2010,  ranged from  approximately  0.51% to 12.38% of the  Company's  average  invested  capital in each
Portfolio Fund.  Incentive fees or allocations for the same fiscal year ranged from approximately  0.00% to 8.27% of the
Company's  average  invested capital in each Portfolio Fund. These ratios may vary over time depending on the allocation
of the Company's  assets among the Portfolio Funds and the actual  expenses and investment  performance of the Portfolio
Funds.  Although the foregoing ranges of Portfolio Fund expense ratios are based on audited financial data received from
the Portfolio Funds, the ranges were not audited by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

For the year ended March 31, 2010,  aggregate  purchases and sales of the Portfolio  Funds amounted to  $89,587,642  and
$103,720,874, respectively.

4. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO THE PORTFOLIO FUNDS

As of March 31, 2010, the Company had an unfunded  investment  commitment to Blackstone  Real Estate Special  Situations
Fund, LP in the amount of $508,631.

5. ADVISORY FEE

Pursuant to the terms of the  advisory  agreement  between the Company and the  Adviser,  the Company pays the Adviser a
monthly fee at an annual rate of 1.00% (the "Advisory Fee") based on the Company's net assets  determined as of the last
business day before taking into  consideration the Advisory Fee. For the year ended March 31, 2010, the Advisory Fee was
$4,788,589.  Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory  agreement between the Adviser and the Subadviser,  the Adviser pays
75% of the Advisory Fee it receives from the Company to the Subadviser. The Subadviser is also reimbursed by the Company
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Subadviser related to the Company, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

As part of the  Reorganization,  the  incentive  allocation  has been  eliminated  as of January  1, 2010.  Prior to the
Reorganization,  an  incentive  allocation  was  calculated  with  respect to each Member on the last  business day of a
calendar year and upon repurchase of all or any portion of such Investor's Interest (an


                                                                                                                      20

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

"Incentive  Period").  An Incentive  Period for each  Member's  Interest  started  immediately  following  the preceding
Incentive  Period and ended on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a calendar year;  (ii)
the next repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's  Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser
(collectively  the "Special  Members") in  connection  with such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or Subadviser to the
Company;  or (iv) the dissolution of the Company.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation (to the Special  Members) for an
Incentive  Period  equaled 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of (a) profit net of losses  (after taking into account
expenses,  including  the  management  fee paid by the Company)  allocated  to each  Member's  capital  account for such
Incentive  Period over (b) the greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the
balance in the Member's Loss Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward"  for the initial  Incentive Period was zero and for each Incentive Period thereafter was
equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward  as of the end of the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative difference between the net losses over net profits allocated
to the Member for the current Incentive Period.

The "Hurdle  Rate Amount" is the return a Member would  receive if its  Interest as of the  beginning of that  Incentive
Period  (adjusted  appropriately  for any additional  subscriptions)  earned a rate of return equal to the one-year U.S.
Treasury  note,  as  determined  on the first day of each  calendar  quarter and reset on the first day of each calendar
quarter.  The Hurdle Rate Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The one-year U.S. Treasury
note rates for June 30, 2009,  September  30, 2009 and December  31, 2009 were  0.5394%,  0.5482% and 0.3469% per annum,
respectively. On June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, incentive allocations of $651 and $372,026 were realized.

In the case of a repurchase of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the last business day of the calendar  year,
the Member was treated as having two  independent  Interests in the Company,  one of which was being  repurchased in its
entirety.  Allocations to the Investor and  subscriptions  made by the Member during the Incentive  Period prior to such
repurchase, and the Member's opening capital account balance and Loss Carryforward as of the beginning of such Incentive
Period,  were  allocated  between the two  Interests  in  proportion  to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that was
repurchased.

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Affiliates of the Adviser may have banking,  underwriting,  lending, brokerage, or other business relationships with the
Portfolio Funds in which the Company invests and with companies in which the Portfolio Funds invest.

Effective  November 19, 2009,  the Board is made up of five  Directors who are not  "interested  persons," as defined by
Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company (the "Disinterested Directors"). The Disinterested Directors receive an
annual retainer of $10,000 and per-meeting fees of: $2,000 for in-person  attendance at quarterly meetings of the Board;
$1,000 for telephonic participation at a quarterly Board meeting or for participation at a telephonic special meeting of
the Board; and $1,000 for each

audit committee  meeting  (whether held in-person or by telephone).  All  Disinterested  Directors may be reimbursed for
expenses  of  attendance  at each  regular or special  meeting of the Board or of any  committee  thereof  and for their
expenses,  if any, in connection with any other service or activity they perform or engage in as Directors.  The Company
incurred  $53,500 of retainer and per meeting  fees for the year ended March 31, 2010,  $7,000 of which is payable as of
March 31, 2010.

PFPC Trust  Company,  an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services  Group  ("PNC"),  serves as custodian of the Company's
assets and  provides  custodial  services  for the  Company.  PNC Global  Investment  Services  (U.S.),  Inc.  serves as
administrator  and accounting  agent to the Company and in that capacity  provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,
investor related services, and regulatory  administrative  services. The Company pays a monthly fee to the custodian and
the administrator based primarily upon month-end Members' Capital.

Effective October 23, 2009,  Merrill Lynch,  Pierce,  Fenner & Smith  Incorporated  replaced Banc of America  Investment
Services,  Inc. as the placement  agent of the Company (the "Placement  Agent").  Investors were charged a placement fee
(sales load) (the "Placement Fee") on Interests placed by the Placement Agent of 1.25% of the investment  amount if such
amount was less than $500,000 (subject to the minimum investment). There was no Placement Fee on investments of $500,000
or more.  The  Placement  Fee was paid to the  Placement  Agent.  The  Placement  Fee was waived for certain  investors.
Subsequently,  at the time of the  Reorganization,  the  agreement  between  the  Company  and the  Placement  Agent was
terminated.

The Company's costs in connection with the Reorganization were borne by the Adviser.

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Company invests trade various financial  instruments
and may enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance  sheet risk. These include,  but are not limited to,
short selling,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. However, as a result of the investments by the Company as a
limited partner or member,  the Company's  liability with respect to its investments in the Portfolio Funds is generally
limited to the NAV of its interest in each Portfolio Fund.

Because the Company is a closed-end  investment  company,  Interests are not redeemable at the option of Members and are
not  exchangeable  for interests of any other fund.  Although the Board in its discretion may cause the Company to offer
from time to time to repurchase Interests at the Members' capital account value,  Interests are considerably less liquid
than shares of funds that trade on a stock  exchange or shares of open-end  investment  companies.  With  respect to any
offer to repurchase  Interests by the Company,  the aggregate  repurchase  amount will be determined by the Board in its
discretion and such repurchase amount may represent only a small portion of outstanding Interests. Because the Company's
investments  in Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have limited  liquidity,  the Company may not be able to fund  significant
repurchases. Members whose Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the risk that the


                                                                                                                      22

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS (CONTINUED)

Company's members' capital account value may fluctuate significantly between the time that they submit their request for
repurchase and the date as of which Interests are valued for the purpose of repurchase.

As  described  in the  footnotes of the  Company's  Schedule of  Investments  and in Note 3, some  Portfolio  Funds have
suspended or restricted  withdrawals of capital,  which increases the liquidity risk for the Company.  Liquidity risk is
the risk that the Company will  encounter  difficulty in meeting  obligations  associated  with  financial  liabilities.
Liquidity  could be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or  unsecured  sources of financing,  an inability to
sell assets or to withdraw  assets from Portfolio  Funds, or unforeseen  outflows of cash to meet tender  demands.  This
situation may arise due to circumstances  outside of the Company's  control,  such as a general market  disruption or an
operational  issue  affecting the Company or third  parties,  including the Portfolio  Funds.  Also, the ability to sell
assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.

The Company's  capital invested in the Portfolio Funds can be redeemed on a limited basis. As a result,  the Company may
not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in the Portfolio Funds in order to meet liquidity requirements.

There are a number of other risks to the Company.  Three principal types of risk that can adversely affect the Company's
investment  approach are market risk,  strategy risk, and manager risk. The Company also is subject to multiple  manager
risks, possible limitations in investment opportunities,  allocation risks, lack of diversification, and other risks for
the Company and potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

9. GUARANTEES

In the normal  course of business,  the Company  enters into  contracts  that contain a variety of  representations  and
warranties and which provide general indemnities. The Company's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve  future claims  against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However,  based on  experience,  the
Company expects the risk of loss due to these warranties and indemnities to be remote.

10. LITIGATION EVENT

The events  described  below have not directly  impacted  the Company or had any known  material  adverse  effect on its
financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005, certain affiliates of the Adviser,  including the former investment adviser to the Company, entered
into Assurances of Discontinuance  with the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in
connection  with matters  relating to mutual fund trading.  Copies of the SEC Orders are available on the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the NYAG  Settlements are available as part of the Bank of America  Corporation  Form 8-K
filing of February 10, 2005.


                                                                                                                      23

10. LITIGATION EVENT (CONTINUED)

In connection with the events that resulted in the NYAG  Settlements and SEC Orders,  various parties filed suit against
certain Columbia Funds (including former Nations Funds),  the Trustees of the Columbia Funds (including  Trustees of the
former  Nations  Funds),  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  (the  former  parent of the  Adviser)  and certain of its
affiliated  entities  and/or Bank of America  Corporation and certain of its affiliated  entities.  More than 300 cases,
including  those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the Columbia  Funds,  their Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial
Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of America Corporation and its affiliated entities, were transferred
to a  multi-district  proceeding in the Federal  District Court in Maryland for  consolidated  or  coordinated  pretrial
proceedings.  The parties have reached  settlements  with respect to the claims in the actions  concerning  the Columbia
Funds. All such settlements are subject to court approval.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date these financial  statements were issued,  and has noted
the following:

Subsequent to March 31, 2010, the Company received additional capital subscriptions of $4,750,000.

On March 30, 2010, the Company  announced a tender offer to purchase up to  $50,000,000  of  outstanding  Interests from
Members. The net asset value of Interests will be calculated for this purpose on June 30, 2010. The tender offer expired
on April 26, 2010.

As of April 1, 2010, the Adviser transferred all of its investment  advisory services to its affiliate,  Banc of America
Capital Advisors LLC ("BACA") (the "Transfer").  As a result of the Transfer,  BACA has assumed all responsibilities for
serving as the  investment  adviser to the Company and as the  management  services  provider to the TI 1 Fund under the
terms of the investment advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Company and the management  agreement between the
Adviser and the TI 1 Fund,  respectively.  The personnel of the Adviser who will provide services to the Company and the
TI 1 Fund are the same personnel who previously  provided such services to the Company and the TI 1 Fund.  Additionally,
no changes in the management of the Company and the TI 1 Fund are expected as a result of the Transfer.

BACA is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act and is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BAC.

   (e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          The  registrant's  Audit  Committee  is  required to  pre-approve  the
          engagement  of the  registrant's  independent  accountants  to provide
          audit  and  permissible  non-audit  services  to  the  registrant  and
          non-audit  services  to its  investment  adviser  (not  including  any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another  investment  adviser) or any
          entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common  control with such
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          ("Adviser  Affiliates"),  if the  engagement  relates  directly to the
          operations or financial reporting of the registrant.

               The Audit Committee has adopted a Policy for Engagement of
          Independent Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit Services ("Policy").
          The Policy sets forth the understanding of the Audit Committee
          regarding the engagement of the registrant's independent accountants
          to provide (i) audit and permissible audit-related, tax and other
          services to the registrant (collectively "Fund Services"); (ii)
          non-audit services to the registrant's investment adviser (not
          including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management
          and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser)
          and Adviser Affiliates, if the engagement relates directly to the
          operations or financial reporting of the registrant (collectively
          "Fund-related Adviser Services"); and (iii) certain other audit and
          non-audit services to the registrant's investment adviser (not
          including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management
          and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser)
          and Adviser Affiliates. Unless a type of service receives general
          pre-approval under the Policy, it requires specific pre-approval by
          the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the independent
          accountants. Pre-approval of non-audit services to the registrant, the
          registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
          role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
          overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser Affiliates may be
          waived provided that the "de minimis" requirements set forth under
          paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are met.

               Under the Policy, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval
          authority to any pre-designated member or members who are independent
          directors. The member(s) to whom such authority is delegated must
          report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to
          the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. The Audit Committee's
          responsibilities with respect to the pre-approval of services
          performed by the independent accountants may not be delegated to
          management.

<PAGE>

               The Policy requires the Fund Treasurer or his or her designee to
          submit to the Audit Committee, on an annual basis, a schedule of the
          types of services that are subject to general pre-approval. The
          schedule(s) provide a description of each type of service that is
          subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide
          estimated fee caps for each instance of providing each service. The
          Audit Committee will review and approve the types of services and
          review the projected fees for the next fiscal year and may add to, or
          subtract from, the list of general pre-approved services from time to
          time based on subsequent determinations. That approval acknowledges
          that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the specific types of
          services that the independent accountants will be permitted to
          perform. The Fund Treasurer or his or her designee must update the fee
          amounts to the extent necessary at each of the regularly scheduled
          meetings of the Audit Committee.

   (e)(2) The  percentage  of  services  described in paragraphs (b) through (d)
          of this Item  approved  pursuant to the "de minimis"  exception  under
          paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of Rule 2-01 of  Regulation  S-X  during  the
          fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 was zero.

     (f)  The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal  accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were  attributed to work  performed by persons
          other than the principal accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
          was less than fifty percent.

     (g)  The  amount of  non-audit  fees that were  billed by the  registrant's
          principal  accountant for services  rendered to : (i) the  registrant,
          and  (ii)  the  registrant's   investment  adviser  (not  including  a
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          sub-contracted  or overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and any
          entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with the
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010,  were $110,723 and $387,000,
          respectively.

          The  amount of  non-audit  fees that were  billed by the  registrant's
          principal  accountant for services  rendered to : (i) the  registrant,
          and  (ii)  the  registrant's   investment  adviser  (not  including  a
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          sub-contracted  or overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and any
          entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with the
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          for the fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  2009,  were  $120,290  and $0,
          respectively.

     (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of the  board  of  directors  has
          considered  whether the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
          rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including any
          sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
          entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common control with the
          investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the registrant
          that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
          2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
          accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.

<PAGE>

ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a)  Schedule of  Investments  in securities of  unaffiliated  issuers as of the
     close  of the  reporting  period  is  included  as  part of the  report  to
     shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)  Not applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY  VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The   registrant   has   delegated  to  Grosvenor   Capital   Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor"),  the sub-adviser,  the  responsibility to vote proxies related to
portfolio securities.

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered  investment  adviser  like  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.
("GROSVENOR"  or the "FIRM") to implement  proxy voting  policies and procedures
reasonably  designed to ensure that they vote  proxies in the best  interests of
their  clients.  Pursuant  to that rule,  Grosvenor  has  adopted  Proxy  Voting
Policies and Procedures (the "PROXY POLICIES") that have been designed to ensure
that  Grosvenor  votes proxies in the best  interests of the various  investment
management   accounts  that  Grosvenor   manages  (each,  a   "GROSVENOR-MANAGED
ACCOUNT").

WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS

Each Grosvenor-Managed  Account is either: (i) a "fund of funds" that invests in
underlying  investment funds ("PORTFOLIO FUNDS") but does not invest directly in
securities of operating companies,  except on a limited basis or (ii) a "feeder"
fund that invests in such a "fund of funds."

As a result, the most common scenario in which Grosvenor is requested to respond
to proxy requests  relating to securities held by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts is where Grosvenor is requested to vote limited partnership  interests,
limited  liability  company  interests,  shares or similar  equity  interests in
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest. In rare
cases,  Grosvenor  is requested to vote on matters  relating to  investments  in
operating companies.

For  purposes  of  convenience,  each  request  to  vote a  security  held  by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is referred to as a "PROXY REQUEST."

MATERIAL PROPOSALS AND IMMATERIAL PROPOSALS

Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories,  those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

An  "IMMATERIAL  PROPOSAL"  is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD NOT, in the
reasonable judgment of the relevant Grosvenor Compliance Officer, either: (a) be
reasonably   likely  to  have  a  material   adverse   effect  on  the  relevant
Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (E.G., a proposal to approve a change in the name
of a Portfolio  Fund,  to approve a Portfolio  Fund's  previous  year's  audited
financial  statements,  to approve a Portfolio Fund's appointment of independent
auditors,  to elect new directors of a Portfolio Fund,  ETC.); or (b) materially
adversely  change the terms on which  future  investments  may be made by one or
more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  In other words, a proposal that, if adopted,
would  change  any one or more  terms  in a  manner  that is  favorable,  or not
materially  adverse,  to  existing  or  future  investors,   is  an  "Immaterial
Proposal."

<PAGE>

A "MATERIAL  PROPOSAL" is a proposal that is not an Immaterial Proposal (I.E., a
Material  Proposal is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD,  in the  reasonable
judgment of such Compliance Officer,  either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a
material  adverse effect on the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s);  or (b)
materially adversely change the terms on which future investments may be made by
one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts).

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST

It is Grosvenor's policy to ACT on each Immaterial Proposal,  unless Grosvenor's
Operations Committee determines otherwise.

It is Grosvenor's policy to CONSENT to each Immaterial Proposal, unless:

- -    the Primary Investment Principal (defined below) or a member of Grosvenor's
     Operations Committee objects to such Immaterial Proposal; or

- -    Grosvenor's Operations Committee determines,  based on information provided
     to it by certain  persons within the Firm,  that consent to such Immaterial
     Proposal would not be consistent with the investment objective(s), policies
     and restrictions of the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s). (Grosvenor's
     Operations  Committee,  however,  after due  consideration,  may  authorize
     Grosvenor to act  favorably on an  Immaterial  Proposal in this  situation,
     upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the Operations  Committee
     may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances.)

Except  as  discussed  below  under  "MANAGING  CONFLICTS  OF  INTEREST,"  it is
Grosvenor's  general policy to ACT on each Proxy Request  relating to a Material
Proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Grosvenor employee who has
been designated by Grosvenor's  Investment  Committee as the primary  investment
principal with respect to the investment  manager or securities in question (the
"PRIMARY INVESTMENT PRINCIPAL"); provided, however, that:

          -    any member of Grosvenor's  Investment Committee may object to the
               recommendation of a Primary Investment Principal in response to a
               Proxy  Request.  In the case of any such  objection,  the  matter
               shall be  referred to  Grosvenor's  Investment  Committee,  whose
               decision shall be final and conclusive;  provided,  however, that
               Grosvenor's  Chief  Executive  Officer or Grosvenor's  Operations
               Committee  may veto any action  proposed to be taken by a Primary
               Investment  Principal or by Grosvenor's  Investment  Committee in
               response to a Proxy Request; and

          -    Grosvenor's Operations Committee may object to the recommendation
               of a Primary Investment  Principal in response to a Proxy Request
               if it determines,  based on information provided to it by certain
               persons within the Firm, that consent to such Proxy Request would
               not be consistent with the investment objective(s),  policies and
               restrictions  of  the  relevant   Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).
               (Grosvenor's    Operations   Committee,    however,   after   due
               consideration,  may  authorize  Grosvenor  to act  favorably on a
               Proxy Request relating to a Material  Proposal in this situation,
               upon such terms and subject to such  conditions as the Operations
               Committee   may   determine   to   be   appropriate   under   the
               circumstances.)

FACTORS  CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING  WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST

Grosvenor  expects that Proxy  Requests  frequently  will  request  Grosvenor to
approve measures that reduce the rights,  powers and authority,  and/or increase
the duties and obligations,  associated with the security in question  ("ADVERSE
MEASURES").  For example,  it is anticipated that Proxy Requests frequently will
request  Grosvenor to

<PAGE>

approve increased fees and/or less favorable  liquidity  provisions  relating to
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts invest.

Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend  favorable  action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse  Measures as
long as such Primary  Investment  Principal  reasonably  believes,  based on the
totality of the facts and  circumstances,  that  continuing to hold the relevant
security has a reasonable  probability  of  conferring  benefits on the relevant
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s)   (E.G.,   continued  access  to  a  high-quality
investment manager) that outweigh the adverse affect(s) of such Adverse Measure,
considered over the anticipated  holding period of such security in the hands of
the relevant Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In  furtherance  of  Grosvenor's  goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  interests  of  the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  will not  implement  any  decision  to  respond to a Proxy
Request in a particular manner unless and until a Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer
has implemented certain procedures to: (i) identify whether Grosvenor is subject
to a conflict of interest  in taking  action in response to such Proxy  Request;
(ii) assess the  materiality  of such a conflict;  and (iii)  address a material
conflict  in a manner  designed  to serve  the best  interests  of the  affected
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).  A  conflict  of  interest  ordinarily  will  be
considered material if it can reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of
its related  persons) has an incentive or otherwise may be influenced to respond
to the Proxy  Request in a manner  designed  to benefit  Grosvenor  (or any such
related person) rather than the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) (even if
there is no ostensible  detriment to the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)
from  responding  to such request in that manner).  (In addition,  a conflict of
interest  may  be  considered  material  if it can  reasonably  be  argued  that
Grosvenor  has an incentive or otherwise may be influenced to respond to a Proxy
Request in a manner  designed  to favor one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
over  one  or  more   other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts.)   All   materiality
determinations   are  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  particular  facts  and
circumstances.

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of  interest in taking  action in response to a
Proxy Request but that such  conflict is not material,  he or she shall issue an
instruction  to take action in response to such Proxy Request as provided  above
under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."

If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is  subject  to a material  conflict  of  interest  in taking  action in
response to a Proxy Request,  he or she shall, in  consultation  with such other
Grosvenor  personnel  as he  or  she  determines  to be  appropriate  under  the
circumstances,  determine how to address such conflict.  In  determining  how to
address a material conflict of interest, the Compliance Officer may consider the
following potential  solutions,  as well as any other solutions he or she wishes
to consider:

     -    in  the  case  of  a  non-discretionary   Grosvenor-Managed   Account,
          disclosing the conflict of interest to the appropriate parties;

     -    in the case of a discretionary  Grosvenor-Managed Account,  disclosing
          the  conflict of interest  to the  investor(s)/participant(s)  in such
          Account and obtaining  their consent (in accordance with the governing
          documents of such  Account) to act on the Proxy  Request in accordance
          with the  decision  reached by  Grosvenor  with  respect to such Proxy
          Request; and

     -    in the case of any Grosvenor-Managed  Account, engaging an independent
          third party to recommend a response to the Proxy Request.

In cases where the Compliance  Officer  determines  that Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of interest in  responding  to a Proxy  Request
and that such conflict is material,  he or she shall not issue an instruction to
take action in response to such Proxy  Request in  accordance  with the decision
reached by  Grosvenor,  or  communicate  the decision  reached by Grosvenor to a
non-discretionary Grosvenor-Managed Account, without first determining that such
action is in the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


GROSVENOR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P. ("GROSVENOR" OR THE "FIRM")

     The  Registrant's  (the  "Master  Fund")  assets are managed  pursuant to a
Sub-Advisory Agreement by Grosvenor. Grosvenor maintains an Investment Committee
that is responsible for, among other things:

     -    establishing  internal portfolio  management  guidelines  ("Investment
          Guidelines")  for each  investment  fund or account that is managed or
          advised by Grosvenor  (each, a  "Grosvenor-Managed  Account").  In the
          case of the Master Fund, these  investment  objectives and constraints
          are subject to approval by the Master Fund's Board of Directors.

     -    identifying, evaluating and approving (or disapproving) the investment
          strategies  in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including  the
          Master Fund, may invest.

     -    identifying,  evaluating and approving (or  disapproving)  third-party
          investment  management  firms  ("Investment   Managers")  that  employ
          investment  strategies  that  have  been  approved  by the  Investment
          Committee.

     -    monitoring investment strategies and Investment Managers.

     Grosvenor's  Chief  Executive  Officer is responsible  for assigning one or
more  senior  level  investment  professionals  (each,  a  "Grosvenor  Portfolio
Manager") to each  Grosvenor-Managed  Account,  including the Master Fund, whose
function is to construct a portfolio for such Grosvenor-Managed Account by using
investment  strategies  and  Investment  Managers that have been approved by the
Investment   Committee   (subject   to  the   Investment   Guidelines   of  such
Grosvenor-Managed Account).

     Grosvenor's  Investment Committee is currently comprised of David B. Small,
David S.  Richter,  and Brian A.  Wolf.  All  three  members  of the  Investment
Committee  are Managing  Directors of Grosvenor.  Michael J. Sacks,  Grosvenor's
Chief Executive Officer,  is not a member of the Investment  Committee,  but has

*  ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AS OF THE END OF A PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ALL
   SUBSCRIPTIONS TO, AND ARE REDUCED BY ALL WITHDRAWALS FROM, GROSVENOR FUNDS
   EFFECTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS THE LAST DAY OF SUCH
   PERIOD. DATA FOR 2009 AND 2010 ARE ESTIMATED AND UNAUDITED.

     COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE.  Mr.  Sacks  and  the  members  of the  Investment
Committee each receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon
the success of the Firm. In addition, each holds an equity participation,  which
entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not based upon the performance or
net  asset  value  of the  Master  Fund or any  other  accounts  managed  by the
Investment Committee.

     OWNERSHIP BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. As of  the date  of this Form, none of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Master Fund owns any interests in the Master Fund.

     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  Grosvenor  is subject to  significant  conflicts of
interest in managing  the  business and affairs of the Master Fund and in making
investment   decisions  for  the  Master  Fund.   Such  conflicts  could  affect
Grosvenor's objectivity and the performance of the Master Fund. Certain of these
conflicts are described below.

GENERAL

     Grosvenor  and its related  persons  (which,  for purposes of this section,
include persons who are either  currently or formerly related to Grosvenor) will
not devote  their full  business  time to the business and affairs of the Master
Fund. Grosvenor and its related persons are free to engage in any other business
or act as  investment  adviser to or  investment  manager of any other person or
entity,  whether or not  having  investment  objectives  similar to those of the
Master Fund, on terms  (including terms relating to fees and liquidity) that are
the same as or different  from those  available  to the  investors in the Master
Fund. Nothing in the governing  documents of the Master Fund limits or restricts
the right of Grosvenor and its related  persons to engage in and devote time and
attention to other businesses or to render services of whatever kind or nature.

     Grosvenor and its related persons are currently involved in, and may in the
future become involved in, other business ventures, including: (i) investing in,
entering into fee-,  revenue-  and/or  profit-sharing  agreements  ("Fee Sharing
Agreements")  with,  operating  and/or managing other  investment  management or
investment  advisory firms ("Related  Investment  Management  Firms");  and (ii)
managing and/or  administering  other investment funds and accounts.  The Master
Fund will not share in the risks or  rewards of such  other  ventures.  Further,
such other  ventures  will both  compete  with the Master  Fund for the time and
attention of Grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional
conflicts of interest or raise other special  considerations,  as described more
fully below. In addition,  Grosvenor and its related  persons,  in investing and
trading for  accounts  (including  their  proprietary  accounts)  other than the
Master  Fund,  may make use of  information  obtained  by them in the  course of
investing for the Master Fund.  Grosvenor  and its related  persons will have no
obligation  to  compensate  the Master Fund in any respect for their  receipt of
such  information  or to account to the Master Fund for any profits  earned from
their use of such information.

     Grosvenor personnel may discuss investment ideas with portfolio managers at
firms other than Grosvenor. Such discussions may be mutually beneficial, but may
under certain  circumstances benefit third-parties with information developed in
connection  with  operating  the Master  Fund (and for which the Master Fund has
paid to develop).  It is also possible that such  discussions  could  ultimately
prove to be detrimental to the Master Fund,  although  Grosvenor  considers that
possibility to be unlikely.

<PAGE>

DIFFERENCES IN GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS

     Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  currently  manage or advise  numerous
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts in addition to the Master Fund, and expect to manage
or advise additional  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts in the future.  Certain of the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  have or will have  investment  objectives  that are
identical  or  substantially  similar  to those of the  Master  Fund.  It is not
anticipated,  however, that the Master Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
having  identical  or  substantially  similar  investment  objectives  will have
identical or substantially similar investment  portfolios.  Differing investment
portfolios can be expected to result from several  factors,  including,  without
limitation, the following:

     -    different   investment  decisions  made  by  the  different  Grosvenor
          Portfolio   Managers  assigned  to  the  different   Grosvenor-Managed
          Accounts;

     -    regulatory   and/or   tax   restrictions   that   apply   to   certain
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not to others;

     -    investment  constraints  imposed  by  Investment  Managers  on certain
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not on others;

     -    the  availability  of particular  Investment  Funds for  investment by
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others;

     -    different  risk/return  characteristics   (notwithstanding  that  such
          Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   generally   have   similar   investment
          objectives);

     -    client-imposed  portfolio management  restrictions and/or other client
          instructions; and

     -    the   amount  of  cash   available   for   investment   by   different
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times.

     As a result of factors such as these,  the Master Fund may have a different
investment  portfolio  (and, as a result,  different  performance  results) from
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  even  though the Master  Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  may  have  identical  or   substantially   similar
investment objectives.

     The  Master  Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  may be managed by
different  Grosvenor  Portfolio  Managers  even  though the Master Fund and such
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may have identical or  substantially  similar
investment objectives. Grosvenor Portfolio Managers are authorized to invest the
assets  of  the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  for  which  they  have  investment
responsibility  in a wide range of Investment Funds. As a result, it is expected
that the Master Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will have  different
investment  portfolios  resulting  from different  investment  decisions made by
their respective  Grosvenor Portfolio  Managers,  even if they have identical or
substantially  similar  investment  objectives.  Further,  the factors described
above  are  likely  to  result in  different  portfolios  for  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that are managed by the same Grosvenor Portfolio Managers,  even though
such   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  have  identical  or  substantially  similar
investment objectives.

     Regulatory  and/or tax  restrictions  may  prohibit  the  Master  Fund from
participating  in  investment  opportunities  that are  available to one or more
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  For example,  certain  Grosvenor Parties or
their advisory  clients  (including other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts) have Fee

<PAGE>

Sharing   Agreements  with  certain   "early-stage"  or  "start-up"   investment
management firms ("Emerging Managers") pursuant to which they share in the fees,
revenues and/or profits of such Emerging  Managers in exchange for "seeding" the
Emerging Managers'  operations.  Also, as discussed above,  Grosvenor Parties or
their  advisory  clients  (including  other  Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts)  have
invested  or may  invest in,  have  entered  into or may enter into Fee  Sharing
Agreements  with, may operate and/or may manage  Related  Investment  Management
Firms.  In  certain  cases,  arrangements  with  Emerging  Managers  or  Related
Investment  Management Firms enable Grosvenor Parties and their advisory clients
to invest in Investment  Funds  sponsored by such  Emerging  Managers or Related
Investment  Management  Firms  on  terms  that are  more  favorable  than  those
otherwise  available to clients of such Emerging Managers or Related  Investment
Management  Firms.  Grosvenor  does not intend to cause the Master Fund to enter
into Fee  Sharing  Agreements  with  Emerging  Managers  or  Related  Investment
Management Firms. Grosvenor does not intend to allocate the Master Fund's assets
to any Emerging  Manager or Related  Investment  Management Firm in which any of
the Grosvenor  Parties has an  investment or with whom any of Grosvenor  Parties
has a Fee Sharing Agreement.

     Similarly,  the Investment  Managers of the  Investment  Funds in which the
Master Fund wishes to invest may impose  investment  restrictions  on the Master
Fund but not on other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. Such restrictions could render
the Master Fund ineligible to invest, in whole or in part, in an Investment Fund
in which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are free to invest, to the
possible detriment of the Master Fund.

MULTIPLE GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS INVESTING IN THE SAME INVESTMENT FUND

     A number of different  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (and persons  associated
with  Grosvenor)  may invest or be invested in the same  Investment  Fund at the
same time (although such parties may have made their  respective  investments in
such  Investment  Fund at  different  times  and,  accordingly,  may  experience
different  investment results in connection with such investments).  The ability
of these  different  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  (and persons  associated  with
Grosvenor) to  withdraw/redeem  from such Investment Fund may differ  materially
due to the timing of their  respective  investments in such Investment Fund, the
different  classes of  interests in such  Investment  Fund in which they invest,
special  arrangements  negotiated with the Investment Manager of such Investment
Fund  and/or   other   factors.   The   reasons   why  the   various   different
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (or persons associated with Grosvenor) may wish or be
compelled to withdraw/redeem  from a particular  Investment Fund also may differ
materially,  and could be the result of a  withdrawal/redemption  request from a
participant in a Grosvenor-Managed Account that received information relating to
such Investment Fund in a report that is not provided to all participants in the
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  (see  "Different   Reporting   Packages"   below).
Similarly, the ability of the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (or persons associated
with  Grosvenor)  to  invest in a  particular  Investment  Fund also may  differ
materially.

     Withdrawals/redemptions  or subscriptions by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  (and/or by persons  associated with Grosvenor) from or to a particular
Investment Fund could in certain cases adversely affect other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts   that   are   invested   in   such   Investment   Fund.    Significant
withdrawals/redemptions  or subscriptions  could,  for example,  cause portfolio
damage,   portfolio   dilution,   depletion  of  liquidity,   costly   portfolio
rebalancings,  imposition of withdrawal "gates" and  under-allocation to certain
positions.  In cases such as these,  Grosvenor would have a conflict of interest
in making  withdrawals/redemptions  or subscriptions  for the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts. This conflict of interest could be exacerbated in situations where one
or  more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  may  withdraw/redeem  from  a  particular
Investment  Fund as of a date as of which  one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts are not able to do so. For example, certain Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
may have invested in a particular  Investment  Fund pursuant to a "lock-up" that
has expired,  whereas one or more other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may still be
subject to "lock-ups" in connection  with their

<PAGE>

investments  in such  Investment  Fund because they either (i)  purchased  their
interests  in such  Investment  Fund  subsequent  to the time  that  such  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts purchased their interests in such Fund or (ii) opted
for  liquidity  classes  in such  Investment  Fund that are  different  from the
liquidity classes owned by such Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. In addition, certain
withdrawal/redemption   "gates"   are,   for   example,   calculated   based  on
withdrawals/redemptions during an entire quarter or other period, so that one or
more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts'   withdrawals/redemptions  (and/or  those  of
persons  associated  with  Grosvenor)  during a quarter  could cause the gate to
prevent one or more other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  withdrawing/redeeming  at
quarter-end,   whereas  the  earlier   withdrawals/redemptions  are  unaffected.
Alternatively,  certain  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may not be in a position to
invest  in an  Investment  Fund  - due  to  lack  of  available  cash,  position
concentration   limits  or  other   reasons  -  at  the  same  time  that  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (and/or persons  associated with Grosvenor) are able
to do so,  perhaps at a net asset value that  Grosvenor  believes is  attractive
from  an  investment   standpoint.   Grosvenor's   management  of  one  or  more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts' investments in a particular Investment Fund could be
adversely  affected by Grosvenor's  decision-making  with respect to one or more
other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are also invested in such Investment Fund.

"AGGREGATION" OF GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS

     In certain cases, Investment Funds may permit Grosvenor to "aggregate" some
or all of the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  invested in such  Investment  Fund--
I.E., all investments made by such Grosvenor-Managed Accounts will be treated as
if they had been made by the same investor.  Under  arrangements  such as these,
certain Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts could make complete  withdrawals/redemptions
under an  individual  investor  "gate"  provided  that  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts did not withdraw/redeem, as the former Grosvenor-Managed Accounts could
make  use  of  the  withdrawal/redemption   capacity  allocable  to  the  entire
"aggregation  group."  Grosvenor  thus has a conflict of interest in  allocating
"gate"  capacity and other  investment  attributes  among the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  included  in  the  same  "aggregation   group."  For  example,   if  a
Grosvenor-Managed Account that is part of an "aggregation group" were to receive
significant  withdrawal/redemption requests, require liquidity for other reasons
or  rebalance  its  portfolio,   it  could  withdraw/redeem  from  an  aggregate
investment  and reduce  withdrawal/redemption  capacity for other members of the
"aggregate group."

     In the case of certain  Investment  Funds,  Grosvenor  is able to negotiate
favorable  business  terms  with  their  Investment  Managers,  but often on the
condition  that  the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  collectively,   maintain  an
aggregate  minimum  level of invested  capital  (I.E.,  capital  invested by all
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts) in a given  Investment  Fund or group of Investment
Funds managed by the same Investment Manager.  The need to maintain an aggregate
minimum investment by all Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts in a particular Investment
Fund or group of  Investment  Funds  managed by the same  Investment  Manager in
order to retain favorable business terms for all Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that
invest in such  Investment  Fund(s)  creates a conflict  of  interest in that it
creates an  incentive  for  Grosvenor  to cause a  Grosvenor-Managed  Account to
invest in or not to withdraw/redeem  from a given Investment Fund (or instead of
withdrawing/redeeming,  to  transfer  an  interest  in such  Investment  Fund to
another  Grosvenor-Managed  Account,  which might not otherwise have invested in
such  Investment  Fund) in order to maintain the minimum  threshold  investment.
Grosvenor  proprietary capital - whether invested directly in an Investment Fund
or through a Grosvenor-Managed Account - may be among the capital which benefits
from the minimum investment  threshold being maintained,  creating an additional
conflict of interest.

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS IN INVESTMENT FUNDS

<PAGE>

     The Grosvenor Portfolio Managers for one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
(each,  a "Divesting  Account") may determine  that it is  appropriate  for such
Divesting Accounts to dispose of (or decrease) their investments in a particular
Investment Fund as of a particular date, while the Grosvenor  Portfolio Managers
for one or more other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (each, an "Investing Account")
may determine that it is appropriate  for such Investing  Accounts to invest (or
increase  their  investments)  in such  Investment  Fund as of the same date. In
certain cases,  Grosvenor  will  implement  decisions such as these by causing a
Divesting Account to withdraw/redeem its interest from an Investment Fund at the
net asset value thereof (as calculated and reported by the Investment Manager of
such Investment Fund), and simultaneously causing an Investing Account to invest
in an interest in such Investment Fund at the net asset value thereof.  In other
cases, Grosvenor will implement such decisions by causing a Divesting Account to
assign its interest in an  Investment  Fund to an Investing  Account in exchange
for a cash payment from the  Investing  Account  equal to the reported net asset
value of the interest being assigned to the Investing Account (as calculated and
reported by the Investment Manager of such Investment Fund).

For purposes of convenience:

     -    Grosvenor  refers  to  transactions  of the types  described  above as
          "transfers"  (even  though the first types of  transactions  described
          above   do   not   involve   any   transfer   between   the   affected
          Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  but only a divestment from an Investment
          Fund by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  and a  substantially
          simultaneous  investment in such  Investment Fund by one or more other
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts);

     -    Grosvenor  refers  to a  transaction  in  which  a  Divesting  Account
          withdraws/redeems its interest from an Investment Fund (in whole or in
          part) at the net  asset  value  thereof,  while an  Investing  Account
          substantially  simultaneously invests (or increases its investment) in
          such Investment Fund, as a "cash transfer;" and

     -    Grosvenor refers to a transaction in which a Divesting Account assigns
          its  interest in an  Investment  Fund (in whole or in part) at the net
          asset  value  thereof  to  an  Investing  Account,  as a  "book  entry
          transfer."

In no instance does any party,  including Grosvenor or the Investment Manager of
any affected Investment Fund, receive any additional  compensation  specifically
as a result of any cash transfer or book entry transfer.  However,  the practice
of engaging in cash transfers or book entry transfers could create certain risks
for investors/participants in affected Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

     For example, in certain cases,  Grosvenor is able to negotiate arrangements
with Investment  Managers - either at the inception of Grosvenor's  relationship
with an  Investment  Manager or on a  case-by-case  basis  after  Grosvenor  has
established such a relationship - that permit a  Grosvenor-Managed  Account that
is the "cash  transferee"  or "book  entry  transferee"  of an  interest in such
Investment  Manager's  Investment Fund to "stand in the shoes" of the transferor
Grosvenor-Managed Account for purposes of determining such business terms as the
duration of any "lock-up period," the continuation of any  performance/incentive
fee  or  other  performance/incentive  compensation  "loss  carryforwards,"  the
applicability of withdrawal  charges,  ETC. Grosvenor  generally intends to take
advantage,  to the fullest extent permitted by law, of the ability of transferee
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to receive  "carryover"  business  terms. In certain
cases, however,  regulatory considerations may prohibit Grosvenor from effecting
transactions  in which  business  terms are  carried  over  from the  transferor
Grosvenor-Managed  Account  to the  transferee  Grosvenor-Managed  Account.  For
example,  ERISA (defined  below) does not permit any such  "carryover"  business
terms to apply in the case of  transfers of  interests  in  Investment  Funds by
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   that  are   subject   to   ERISA  to  any   other
Grosvenor-Managed

<PAGE>

Accounts,  regardless of whether the transferee  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are
subject  to ERISA.  ERISA,  however,  does not  appear to  prohibit  "carryover"
business terms applying in the case of transfers from Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
that are not subject to ERISA to Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts that are subject to
ERISA.

     Further,  in  cases  where  there is  "limited  capacity"  in a  particular
Investment  Fund  that  Grosvenor  determines  to  be an  attractive  investment
opportunity   and  if   Grosvenor   has  any   reason  to  favor  a   particular
Grosvenor-Managed  Account over another  Grosvenor-Managed  Account, there is an
incentive for Grosvenor to cause the  "unfavored"  Grosvenor-Managed  Account to
transfer its interest in such Investment Fund to the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed
Account.

     Similarly  (and  regardless  of whether  there is "limited  capacity"  in a
particular   Investment   Fund),   if  the  fee   structure   of  a   particular
Grosvenor-Managed  Account is more favorable to Grosvenor than the fee structure
of   another   Grosvenor-Managed    Account,   the   ability   to   cause   such
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to participate in "carryover" transfers of interests
in such  Investment Fund creates an incentive for Grosvenor to cause the account
having an  "unfavorable"  fee structure to transfer a "winning"  position to the
account  having a "favorable"  fee  structure,  or to cause the account having a
"favorable" fee structure to transfer a "losing"  position to the account having
an unfavorable fee structure.

INVESTMENTS BY GROSVENOR, ITS RELATED PERSONS AND GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS

     Grosvenor and its related persons may invest in Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.
In addition,  Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  may  place  assets  under the  management  of,  or  otherwise  procure
investment  advisory or investment  management  services  from,  any  Investment
Manager  directly  or  indirectly  used by one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  including  the Master Fund.  Without  limiting the  generality of the
foregoing,  Grosvenor,  its related  persons  and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts may invest in, or withdraw/redeem  investments from, an Investment Fund
in which the Master Fund and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are
invested,  from which they are  withdrawing/redeeming  their  investments  or in
which they are not invested.

     In  certain  instances,  Grosvenor  may be  required  to  allocate  limited
investment  opportunities  in  Investment  Funds  among  Grosvenor,  its related
persons,  the Master Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Grosvenor has
developed   policies  and   procedures   for   allocating   limited   investment
opportunities  in a manner that it believes to be  equitable to  Grosvenor,  its
related persons and the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (including the Master Fund).
Under these policies and procedures,  to the extent that Grosvenor,  its related
persons and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts (each of the  foregoing,  a
"Participating  Account")  wish to invest in a particular  Investment  Fund (and
have funds  available  to make such  investment)  but such  Investment  Fund has
"limited  capacity"  and is  willing to accept  only a portion of the  aggregate
investment  that  Grosvenor,  its  related  persons  and such  Grosvenor-Managed
Account(s)  wish  to  make,  the  aggregate  capacity  made  available  by  such
Investment  Fund to the  Participating  Accounts  generally is allocated to each
Participating  Account  in the  proportion  that the amount  such  Participating
Account  wishes to invest bears to the aggregate  amount that all  Participating
Accounts  wish to  invest,  subject  to  certain  exceptions  set  forth in such
policies and  procedures.  (Similarly,  if interests in an  Investment  Fund are
available in the  "secondary  market" but such interests are not available in an
amount  sufficient to satisfy the aggregate amount that  Participating  Accounts
wish to invest in such interests, such interests generally are allocated to each
Participating  Account that has funds  available to make such  investment in the
proportion that the amount such Participating  Account wishes to invest bears to
the aggregate amount that all Participating  Accounts wish to invest, subject to
certain exceptions set forth in such policies and procedures.) Grosvenor and its
related persons also may participate in limited investment opportunities through
their  investments  in  Grosvenor-Managed

<PAGE>

Accounts that participate in such opportunities. In certain cases, Grosvenor may
determine that it and/or its related  persons shall not directly  participate in
an  Investment   Fund  that  has  "limited   capacity"   unless  and  until  all
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  that  wish  to  invest  in  such  Investment  Fund
(including,  for this  purpose,  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts in which  Grosvenor
and/or its related persons participate) have invested the full amount of capital
they wish to invest in such Investment Fund.

     Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
that place  assets under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure  investment
advisory or investment management services from, any Investment Manager directly
or indirectly used by the Master Fund and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts may do so on terms  (including  terms  relating to fees and  liquidity)
that are more  advantageous than those applicable to the investments that may be
made by the Master Fund and/or such other Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) with such
Investment  Manager.  To the extent that Grosvenor or its related persons invest
with a given Investment  Manager on terms that are more  advantageous than those
on which the Master Fund and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may
invest with such Investment Manager,  Grosvenor and its related persons may have
an incentive to maintain or increase the  investment by the Master Fund and such
other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts with such Investment Manager in order to obtain
and/or  maintain  such  advantageous  terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and its
related persons.

     Grosvenor and its related  persons may from time to time invest,  for their
respective  proprietary  accounts,  in early-stage  Investment  Funds (including
Non-Advised  Funds  (as  defined  below)),  at times  when  investments  in such
Investment  Funds  would  not be  appropriate  for  the  Master  Fund  or  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  If Grosvenor  should  subsequently  determine,  in
accordance  with  its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the  selection  of
Investment  Funds for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that such an Investment
Fund is an appropriate investment for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts,  Grosvenor
and its related  persons will not be required to restructure  the terms on which
they  invest  in such  Investment  Fund in  order  to make  investments  in such
Investment  Fund  available  to the  Master  Fund if,  for  regulatory  or other
reasons, the Master Fund would be (or, in Grosvenor's reasonable  determination,
may be) precluded from investing in such  Investment Fund in the absence of such
restructuring.

     Grosvenor and its related  persons may from time to time invest,  for their
respective   proprietary   accounts,   in  certain  investment  funds  that  are
administered,  but not advised, by Grosvenor (the "Non-Advised  Funds") and from
which  they  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees.  In  many  cases,  such
investments may be made at times when  investments in the Non-Advised  Funds are
not appropriate for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. If Grosvenor should subsequently
determine,  in  accordance  with its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the
selection of Investment Funds for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that such a
Non-Advised  Fund  is  an  appropriate   investment  for  the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  may  cause  the  Master  Fund  and/or  one or  more  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  to invest  in such  Non-Advised  Fund  even  though
Grosvenor  continues  to  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees  from  such
Non-Advised Fund. Moreover,  Grosvenor will not be required to reduce, eliminate
or  restructure  the  administrative  or  similar  fees it  receives  from  such
Non-Advised Fund in order to make investments in such Non-Advised Fund available
to the Master Fund if, for regulatory or other reasons, the Master Fund would be
(or, in Grosvenor's reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded from investing
in such  Non-Advised  Fund in the absence of such fee reduction,  elimination or
restructuring.

POSSIBLE  INCENTIVE  TO FAVOR ONE OR MORE  GROSVENOR-MANAGED  ACCOUNTS  OVER THE
MASTER FUND

     A Grosvenor  Portfolio Manager might have an incentive to favor one or more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts over the Master Fund (for example, with regard to the
selection  of  Investment  Funds for  those  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  or the
allocation of  investment  opportunities  in Investment  Funds that have limited
investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Accounts might pay

<PAGE>

Grosvenor  more for its services  than the Master Fund.  Similarly,  a Grosvenor
Portfolio  Manager may have an incentive to favor one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts over the Master Fund if such Grosvenor Portfolio Manager has a personal
investment in such  "favored"  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  No assurance can be
given that (i) the Master Fund will participate in all investment  opportunities
in which  other  client or  proprietary  accounts of  Grosvenor  and its related
persons  participate,  (ii)  particular  investment  opportunities  allocated to
client or proprietary  accounts of Grosvenor and its related  persons other than
the Master Fund will not outperform  investment  opportunities  allocated to the
Master  Fund,   or  (iii)  the  Master  Fund,   on  the  one  hand,   and  other
similarly-situated  client and proprietary accounts of Grosvenor and its related
persons, on the other hand, will receive equal or similar treatment.

DIFFERENT REPORTING PACKAGES

     Different  participants  in the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  as  well  as
certain other persons  (including  persons who currently have, or who previously
have had, a direct or indirect interest in Grosvenor or who otherwise  currently
are, or who  previously  have been,  associated  with  Grosvenor),  receive oral
and/or written reports from Grosvenor that differ in form,  substance,  level of
detail, timing and/or frequency, based on factors such as: (i) the size of their
investments in the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts; (ii) requests for specific types
of  information  made by such  participants  or persons  acting on their behalf;
(iii)  negotiations  between  Grosvenor and such  participants  or other persons
acting on their  behalf;  and/or (iv)  Grosvenor's  internal  assessment  of the
likely  reporting  needs of such  participants  or of  persons  acting  on their
behalf.

     In  particular,   certain  reports  may  include  information  relating  to
Investment Funds in which the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including the Master
Fund, invest (or in which they are contemplating an investment).

     While  Grosvenor  provides  information  to   investors/recipients  in  the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to enable them to monitor their  investments in such
Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts,   it   cannot   effectively   prevent   any   such
investor/recipient  who has received  information  that has not been provided to
other recipients to use such information to determine whether to:

     -    withdraw/redeem  from a  Grosvenor-Managed  Account  or  increase  its
          investment in a Grosvenor-Managed Account;

     -    invest  directly in  Investment  Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed
          Accounts,  including  the Master Fund,  are invested (or in which they
          are  contemplating  investments),  potentially in competition with the
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Master Fund; or

     -    withdraw/redeem  from Investment Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed
          Accounts,  including the Master Fund, are invested (or from which they
          are   contemplating    withdrawing/redeeming    their    investments),
          potentially  to  the  detriment  of  the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,
          including the Master Fund.

RECEIPT OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION

     Grosvenor may from time to time receive,  from  Investment  Managers of the
Investment Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  invest,  information
that is not generally  known to other  investors in such  Investment  Funds.  In
these cases, legal or regulatory constraints could prevent Grosvenor from acting
in the  manner  in  which  it  otherwise  would  act on  behalf  of one or  more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Master Fund.

<PAGE>

PROXY VOTING

     Grosvenor  has  developed  certain  policies and  procedures  to manage the
conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with voting proxies on behalf
of the Master Fund and the other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts. In accordance with
these policies and procedures,  Grosvenor  endeavors to vote proxies in a manner
that  best   serves   the   interests   of  the   Master   Fund  and  the  other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

TRADE AND CLERICAL ERRORS

     Subject  to the  considerations  set  forth  below,  Grosvenor  is under no
obligation  to  reimburse  the Master  Fund for any errors or  mistakes  made by
Grosvenor,  its  employees  or agents  with  respect to  Grosvenor's  placing or
executing trades for the Master Fund or for any other administrative or clerical
errors or  mistakes  made by the  foregoing  (collectively,  "Trade or  Clerical
Errors"),  as Grosvenor considers such errors and mistakes to be a cost of doing
business.  However, pursuant to the standard of care provisions of the governing
documents of the Master  Fund,  Grosvenor  will be  obligated  to reimburse  the
Master Fund for losses  sustained by the Master Fund as a result of any Trade or
Clerical Error that is caused by  Grosvenor's  failure to adhere to the standard
of care set  forth  in such  provisions.  Grosvenor,  subject  to its  fiduciary
obligations,  will determine:  (i) whether or not any Trade or Clerical Error is
required to be reimbursed in accordance  with such standard of care  provisions;
and (ii) if so,  the  extent of the loss that has been  incurred  by the  Master
Fund. Grosvenor has an inherent conflict of interest with respect to determining
whether  or not a Trade  or  Clerical  Error is  required  to be  reimbursed  in
accordance  with the applicable  standard of care provisions and with respect to
determining the extent of the loss that has been incurred by the Master Fund. If
a Trade or Clerical Error occurs other than as a result of  Grosvenor's  failure
to adhere to the applicable standard of care, Grosvenor, in its sole discretion,
reserves the right to reimburse the Master Fund for any losses  sustained by the
Master  Fund  as  a  result  of  such  Trade  or  Clerical  Error.   Grosvenor's
reimbursement  of the  Master  Fund  for a Trade  or  Clerical  Error  in such a
situation will not  constitute a waiver of  Grosvenor's  general policy to cause
the Master  Fund to bear the losses  associated  with  other  Trade or  Clerical
Errors that occur other than as a result of Grosvenor's failure to adhere to the
applicable  standard  of care.  Any net gain  resulting  from Trade or  Clerical
Errors  will be for the  benefit of the Master  Fund and will not be retained by
Grosvenor.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

     Grosvenor  ordinarily  will not cause the  Master  Fund to incur  brokerage
commissions in connection with its  investments in Investment  Funds (which are,
and are  expected  to continue  to be, the  primary  focus of the Master  Fund's
investment  activities).  However,  Grosvenor  may from  time to time  cause the
Master  Fund to: (i) engage in limited  hedging  transactions;  (ii) make Direct
Investments;  and/or  (iii)  invest  in  bank  demand  deposit  accounts  and/or
high-quality,  short-term  instruments  that earn interest at competitive  rates
(and/or in commingled  investment  products  (E.G.,  "money  market" funds) that
invest in such instruments).  In these cases,  Grosvenor will have the authority
to determine the  financial  intermediaries  to be used in connection  with such
transactions and to negotiate the amount of commission or other  compensation to
be paid to such  intermediaries in connection with such transactions.  Grosvenor
will negotiate such  compensation  on a case-by-case  basis and will not seek to
obtain  products,  research or services other than  transactional  services from
such intermediaries.

     Certain of the  Investment  Funds in which the Master Fund invests may hold
notes or other securities  issued from time to time by Grosvenor,  and Grosvenor
may be aware that such Investment Funds do so. The fact that certain  Investment
Funds may hold  notes or other  securities  issued  by  Grosvenor  could,  under
certain facts and  circumstances,  potentially alter Grosvenor's  objectivity in
determining  whether or not to invest in such Investment Funds and/or whether or
not to withdraw/redeem

<PAGE>

from such Investment Funds.  Grosvenor,  however,  does not expect that it would
ever make  portfolio  management  decisions  for the  Master  Fund that would be
different from the decisions it would make for the Master Fund if such potential
conflict did not exist.

     Grosvenor  and  its  principals,  and the  Investment  Managers  and  their
principals,  may engage in  philanthropic  activities  through  contributions of
their time and/or financial resources to charitable organizations. Grosvenor and
its  principals,  on the  one  hand,  and  the  Investment  Managers  and  their
principals,  on the  other  hand,  may  from  time to time  ask  each  other  to
participate  in their  respective  philanthropic  activities.  Grosvenor and its
principals,  and the  Investment  Managers  and  their  principals,  are free to
participate in  philanthropic  opportunities  brought to their  attention by one
another.  Under no  circumstances  will such  participation or lack thereof be a
factor in Grosvenor's investment management process.

     Similarly, Grosvenor and its principals, and investors in Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts and their principals,  may engage in philanthropic  activities  through
contributions   of  their  time  and/or   financial   resources  to   charitable
organizations.  Grosvenor and its principals,  on the one hand, and investors in
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts and their  principals,  on the other hand,  may from
time to time ask each other to  participate  in their  respective  philanthropic
activities.  Grosvenor and its  principals,  and investors in  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  and  their  principals,  are  free  to  participate  in  philanthropic
opportunities brought to their attention by one another.  Under no circumstances
will such  participation  or lack thereof be a factor in Grosvenor's  investment
management process.

     Grosvenor has frequent  interaction with consultants and financial advisors
who  represent  prospective  and  existing  investors  in the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  including investors that are subject to ERISA. Grosvenor does not pay
these  consultants  or  financial  advisors to recommend  any  Grosvenor-Managed
Account to their clients. However,  consultants and financial advisors have from
time to time invited  Grosvenor and its  principals to participate in particular
philanthropic  activities,  and  can be  expected  to  continue  to do so in the
future.  Grosvenor has participated in such philanthropic activities in the past
and can be expected to continue to do so in the future.  Under no  circumstances
will such  participation  or lack thereof be a factor in Grosvenor's  investment
management process.

     Grosvenor  from time to time provides  meals and  entertainment  to persons
associated  with  consultants,   financial  advisors,  clients  and  prospective
clients. In certain cases, Grosvenor may provide such meals and entertainment to
clients or prospective clients at the request of consultants, financial planners
or other third-parties.

     Grosvenor may from time to time compensate  unaffiliated  third-parties  in
connection with Grosvenor's  participation in investor introduction  conferences
sponsored  by such  third-parties  in which  Grosvenor  meets  with  prospective
investors introduced to Grosvenor by such third-parties.

     Grosvenor  may from time to time enter into  arrangements  with  consulting
firms that represent  existing and prospective  clients,  pursuant to which such
consulting  firms provide  Grosvenor  certain  performance  or other data on the
"fund of funds"  industry.  Grosvenor may compensate  such a consulting firm for
such services on an annual  flat-fee or other basis.  In no event will Grosvenor
enter into any such  arrangement  unless it first  determines to its  reasonable
satisfaction  that the firm that provides services to Grosvenor for compensation
from  Grosvenor  discloses  that  fact to all  clients  to  whom  it  recommends
Grosvenor.

     Persons  associated  with Grosvenor may be related by blood or marriage to,
or  otherwise  have  personal   relationships   with,  persons  associated  with
consulting  firms.  In certain cases,  such persons  associated  with consulting
firms may be responsible  for: (i) analyzing  and/or  monitoring "fund of funds"

<PAGE>


investment  managers  on  behalf  of  such  consulting firms; (ii)  recommending
"fund  of  funds"  investment  managers to the investment committees or  similar
governing  committees  of  such  consulting  firms;  (iii) selecting the  "funds
of  funds"  investment  managers  that  such  consulting  firms will present  to
their  clients as potential managers of such clients' assets; (iv)  recommending
particular  "fund  of  funds" investment managers to clients of such  consulting
firms;  (v)  recommending  that  clients  of  such consulting firms continue  to
retain  the  services  of,  or  discharge, "fund of funds" investment  managers;
and/or  (vi)  otherwise  playing  an  instrumental  role in the process  whereby
clients  of  such  consulting  firms  select, and/or retain or discharge,  "fund
of   funds"  investment  managers.  In  cases  where  persons  associated   with
consulting   firms   have   one   or   more   responsibilities   of  the   types
described  above  and  are  related  by blood or marriage to, or otherwise  have
personal  relationships  with,  persons associated with Grosvenor, such  persons
may  have  an  incentive  to  select  Grosvenor  as  a potential manager of  the
assets  of  clients  of  such  consulting  firms,  to  recommend  Grosvenor   to
clients  of  such  consulting  firms  and/or  to recommend that clients of  such
consulting   firms   continue   to   utilize  Grosvenor's  services.   Grosvenor
believes  that  is  the responsibility of consulting firms to recuse  interested
individuals  or  take other appropriate steps to protect the integrity of  their
decision-making  processes,  and  to  make appropriate disclosures of  potential
conflicts  of  interest to their clients. Grosvenor urges prospective  investors
who  utilize  the  services  of  consulting firms to inquire of such  consulting
firms   whether   they   are   subject   to   such   a  conflict  of   interest.

     Persons  associated  with Grosvenor may be related by blood or marriage to,
or otherwise  have personal  relationships  with,  persons  associated  with the
Investment  Managers of existing or prospective  Investment  Funds or with other
third-parties that provide or contemplate providing services to Grosvenor and/or
the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts. In certain cases, such persons associated with
Grosvenor may be responsible  for: (i) analyzing and/or  monitoring  existing or
prospective  Investment Funds managed by such Investment Managers,  or analyzing
and/or  monitoring  other  third-parties  that provide or contemplate  providing
services  to  Grosvenor  and/or  one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts;  (ii)
recommending that Grosvenor approve  Investment Funds managed by such Investment
Managers as  eligible  investments  for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts;  (iii)
recommending  that one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  add  capital to, or
withdraw their capital (in whole or in part) from,  Investment  Funds managed by
such Investment  Managers;  (iv) making the final decision to approve Investment
Funds  managed by such  Investment  Managers  as  eligible  investments  for the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts;  (v) making the final decision to cause one or more
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts to add capital  to, or  withdraw  their  capital (in
whole or in part) from,  Investment  Funds managed by such Investment  Managers;
(vi) recommending that Grosvenor retain other third-parties that wish to provide
services to  Grosvenor  and/or one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts;  and/or
(vii) recommending that Grosvenor discharge  third-parties that provide services
to one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  In cases where persons  associated
with Grosvenor have one or more  responsibilities  of the types  described above
and  are  related  by  blood  or  marriage  to,  or  otherwise   have   personal
relationships  with, persons associated with Investment  Managers of existing or
prospective  Investment Funds or other third-parties that provide or contemplate
providing services to Grosvenor and/or one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,
such  persons  may  have  an  incentive  to base  their  decisions  on  personal
considerations   rather   than   on  the   best   interests   of  the   affected
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor,  however, monitors relationships of this
type with a view to determining  whether there is a reasonable  likelihood  that
such persons will base their decisions on personal considerations rather than on
the best  interests of the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  and will take
appropriate action if it determines such a reasonable likelihood exists.

GROSVENOR'S FIDUCIARY DUTIES

     Grosvenor has fiduciary  duties to the Master Fund to act in good faith and
with fairness in all its dealings with the Master Fund. Grosvenor will take such
duties  into  account in dealing  with all actual  and  potential  conflicts  of
interest.

<PAGE>

THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS

     The Investment  Managers are likely to be subject to many of the same types
of  conflicts  of  interest to which  Grosvenor  is subject.  For  example,  the
Investment  Managers may be involved in other business  ventures,  including the
management  and/or  administration  of other investment funds and accounts whose
investment  objectives  are identical or  substantially  similar to those of the
Investment Funds. The Master Fund will not share in the risks or rewards of such
other ventures. In addition,  such other ventures will compete with the relevant
Investment Funds for the time and attention of the relevant Investment Managers,
and might  create  additional  conflicts  of  interest  or raise  other  special
considerations.

     The  Investment  Managers  have  responsibility  for  investing the capital
allocated to them. The Investment Managers also manage other accounts (including
other  accounts in which they may have an interest)  and may have  financial and
other  incentives to favor such accounts over the Investment  Funds in which the
Master Fund  invests.  In investing on behalf of other  clients,  as well as the
Investment Funds in which the Master Fund invests,  the Investment Managers must
allocate  their  resources,  as well as limited market  opportunities.  Doing so
could increase the level of competition for the same trades that otherwise might
be made for the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund invests, including the
priorities of order entry, as well as make it difficult or impossible to take or
liquidate a particular position at a price indicated by an Investment  Manager's
strategy.

     In addition,  in connection  with investing and trading for other accounts,
including their proprietary  accounts,  the Investment  Managers may make use of
information  obtained  by them in the course of  investing  and  trading for the
Investment  Funds.  They will have no obligation to  compensate  the  Investment
Funds in any respect for their receipt of such  information or to account to any
such Investment Fund for any profits earned from their use of such information.

     The  Investment  Managers  and their  principals,  in  managing  investment
accounts other than the Investment  Funds, may employ trading methods,  policies
and  strategies  which  differ  from those  which they  employ on behalf of such
Investment  Funds.  Therefore,  the results of the Master Fund's  investments in
such Investment  Funds may differ from the results of other accounts  managed by
such Investment Managers.

     The Investment Managers value the illiquid, longer-term investments held by
their  Investment  Funds in a variety of different  ways, and have  considerable
discretion in doing so. The  Investment  Managers have a conflict of interest in
arriving  at such  valuations,  which  affect  both  the  performance  of  their
Investment  Funds  and the  advisory  compensation  received  by the  Investment
Managers.

     The Investment  Managers have a conflict of interest in allocating  capital
to  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments.  While such  positions  may hold
significant  profit  potential  (and,  therefore,   the  potential  to  generate
substantial    performance/incentive   fees   or   other   performance/incentive
compensation),  they can create  material  valuation and  illiquidity  risks for
investors.     In    addition,     performance/incentive     fees    or    other
performance/incentive  compensation  may be calculated  separately in respect of
certain  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments  irrespective of the overall
performance of an Investment Fund.

     The  Investment  Managers  select the  brokers  and  dealers  that  execute
transactions  for their  respective  Investment  Funds and negotiate the related
brokerage  commissions and other  transaction  costs.  In selecting  brokers and
dealers and/or in negotiating  commissions  and other  compensation,  Investment
Managers  (subject  to their  overall  duty to obtain  "best  execution"  of all
transactions for the Investment Funds they manage):

<PAGE>

     -    have  authority  to and may consider the full range and quality of the
          services  and  products   provided  by  various  brokers  and  dealers
          (including  factors  such as the ability of the brokers and dealers to
          execute    transactions    efficiently,    their   responsiveness   to
          instructions,    their    facilities,    reliability   and   financial
          responsibility,  and the value of any  research  or other  services or
          products they provide); and

     -    do not  necessarily  select brokers and dealers that charge the lowest
          transaction costs.

     An Investment Manager may cause an Investment Fund to pay transaction costs
to a broker or dealer even though such Investment Manager and/or clients of such
Investment   Manager  other  than  such   Investment   Fund  are  the  exclusive
beneficiaries  of non-execution  related products and services  provided by such
broker or dealer.

     These activities and conflicts of interest are explicitly  acknowledged and
consented to by each Member as a necessary  condition to the Member's  admission
to the Master Fund.

changes were implemented after the registrant last provided disclosure in
response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR

          communicated to the registrant's  management,  including the principal
          executive  officer  and  principal   financial  officer,   or  persons
          performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
          regarding required disclosure.

     (b)  There  was  no  change  in  the  registrant's  internal  control  over
          financial  reporting (as defined in Rule  30a-3(d)  under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

            Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are attached hereto.

     (a)(3) Not applicable.

     (b)    Not applicable.

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial

                    ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT - REGISTERED FUNDS

AI FUND POLICY:  CODE OF ETHICS FOR  PRINCIPAL  EXECUTIVE  AND SENIOR  FINANCIAL
OFFICERS

OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT

Item 2 of Form N-CSR (or Form 10K, as  applicable),  the form used by registered
management  investment  companies  to  file  certified  annual  and  semi-annual
shareholder  reports,  requires a registered  management  investment  company to
disclose  (1)  whether  it has  adopted a code of  ethics  that  applies  to the
investment  company's  principal executive officer and senior financial officers
and,  if it has not adopted  such a code of ethics,  why it has not done so, and
(2) any  amendments  to, or waivers  from,  the code of ethics  relating to such
officers.

The Board of each Fund has  adopted  the  following  Code of Ethics,  which sets
forth the  ethical  standards  to which the Fund holds its  principal  executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

POLICY

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following  policy in order to comply with
the requirements as outlined below:

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal  Executive
     Officer,  Principal Financial Officer,  and Principal Accounting Officer or
     Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     -    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
          other public communications made by the Fund;

     -    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     -    the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high standard of business  ethics
and should be sensitive to  situations  that may give rise to actual or apparent
conflicts of interest.

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial
                                    Officers

II.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

     The Board has designated an individual to be primarily  responsible for the
administration  of the Code (the  "Code  Officer").  In the  absence of the Code
Officer,  his or her  designee  shall serve as the Code  Officer,  but only on a
temporary basis.

     The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief legal
officer (the "CLO"). The CLO of the Fund shall assist the Fund's Code Officer in
administration  of this Code. The Code Officer,  in  consultation  with the CLO,
shall  be  responsible  for  applying  this  Code  to  specific  situations  (in
consultation  with Fund  counsel,  where  appropriate)  and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation.

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's  personal interest
interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service  to,  the Fund.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his or her  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result  of the
Covered Officer's position with the Fund. Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and
the rules and  regulations  thereunder  and the  Advisers  Act and the rules and
regulations  thereunder  govern certain  conflicts of interest that arise out of
the  relationships  between Covered Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are
addressed  in  conformity  with  applicable  provisions  of the 1940 Act and the
Advisers Act, they will be deemed to have been handled ethically. The Fund's and
its Adviser's  compliance  programs and procedures  are designed to prevent,  or
identify and correct, violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is
not intended to, repeat or replace those  programs and  procedures,  and conduct
that is  consistent  with such  programs  and  procedures  falls  outside of the
parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable,  its Adviser,  administrator,
principal  underwriter,  pricing and  bookkeeping  agent and/or  transfer  agent
(each,  a "Primary  Service  Provider")  of which the Covered  Officers are also
officers  or  employees.  As a result,  this Code  recognizes  that the  Covered
Officers  will, in the normal course of their duties  (whether  formally for the
Fund  or  for  a  Primary  Service  Provider,  or  for  both),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the Primary Service  Providers and the Fund. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationships
between the Fund and the Primary  Service  Providers and is consistent  with the
performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. If
such  conflicts are addressed in conformity  with  applicable  provisions of the
1940  Act and the  Advisers  Act,  they  will be  deemed  to have  been  handled
ethically.  In  addition,  it is  recognized  by the  Board of the Fund that the
Covered  Officers  also  may be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment  companies or  organizations  affiliated with the sponsor of the Fund
covered  by other  similar  codes and that the  codes of  ethics of those  other
investment  companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers acting
in such capacities for such other investment companies.

<PAGE>

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial
                                    Officers

     This Code covers general  conflicts of interest and other issues applicable
to the Fund under the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002. The overarching  principle is
that the personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly
before the interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest
follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    not  knowingly   use  his  or  her  personal   influence  or  personal
          relationships   improperly  to  influence   investment   decisions  or
          financial  reporting  by the Fund  whereby the Covered  Officer,  or a
          member of his or her family, would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     -    not knowingly  cause the Fund to take action,  or fail to take action,
          for the  individual  personal  benefit of the  Covered  Officer,  or a
          member of his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

     -    not use material non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions made
          or  contemplated  for the Fund to trade  personally or cause others to
          trade  personally  in  contemplation  of the  market  effect  of  such
          transactions; and

     -    report at least annually (or more  frequently,  as appropriate)  known
          affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
          interest with respect to the Fund.

     If a Covered  Officer  believes that he or she has a potential  conflict of
interest that is likely to materially  compromise his or her  objectivity or his
or her  ability to perform  the duties of his or her role as a Covered  Officer,
including  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  that  arises  out of his or her
responsibilities  as an  officer  or  employee  of one or more  Primary  Service
Providers or other funds,  he or she should  consult with the Code Officer,  the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members, as
appropriate.

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially  compromise
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered  Officer and which the
Covered  Officer  should  consider  discussing  with the Code  Officer  or other
appropriate person include:

     -    service as a director  on the board of a public or private  company or
          service as a public official;

     -    the receipt of a non-de  minimus  gift when the gift is in relation to
          doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

     -    the receipt of entertainment  from any company with which the Fund has
          current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
          business-related,  reasonable  in  cost,  appropriate  as to time  and
          place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;


                                   Page 3 of 9

<PAGE>

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial
                                    Officers

     -    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
          with,  any of the Fund's  service  providers,  other than the  Primary
          Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

     -    a direct or  indirect  material  financial  interest  in  commissions,
          transaction  charges  or  spreads  paid  by  the  Fund  for  effecting
          portfolio  transactions or for selling or redeeming  shares other than
          an interest  arising from the Covered  Officer's  employment,  such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     -    to  familiarize  himself or herself with the  disclosure  requirements
          generally  applicable  to  the  Fund,  as  well  as the  business  and
          financial operations of the Fund;

     -    to not knowingly  misrepresent,  and to not knowingly  cause others to
          misrepresent,  facts  about  the Fund to  others,  whether  within  or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel,  legal
          counsel  to  the  Independent  Board  Members  and  auditors,  and  to
          governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     -    to the extent  appropriate  within his or her area of  responsibility,
          consult with other  officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
          Service  Providers with the goal of promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,
          timely and understandable  disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund  files  with,  or  submits  to,  the  SEC  and  in  other  public
          communications made by the Fund; and

     -    to adhere to and,  within his or her area of  responsibility,  promote
          compliance with the standards and  restrictions  imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY COVERED OFFICERS

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered  Officer,  acknowledge
          in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has  received,  read and
          understands the Code, using the form attached as Appendix I hereto;

     -    not retaliate  against any employee or Covered  Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and


                                   Page 4 of 9

<PAGE>

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial
                                    Officers

     -    notify the Code Officer  promptly if he or she knows of any violation,
          or of conduct that  reasonably  could be expected to be or result in a
          violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     The Fund will follow the policy set forth below in investigating and
     enforcing this Code:

     -    The Code  Officer  will  endeavor  to take all  appropriate  action to
          investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

     -    If,  after  such  investigation,  the Code  Officer  believes  that no
          violation has occurred,  the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
          reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

     -    Any matter  that the Code  Officer,  upon  consultation  with the CLO,
          believes  is a violation  will be reported by the Code  Officer or the
          CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible  for granting  waivers,
          as appropriate; and

     -    This Code and any  changes  to or  waivers  of the Code  will,  to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit  Committee  quarterly any
violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES

     This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for the
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms  applicable  to registered  management  investment  companies  thereunder.
Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary Service
Providers  govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered
Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the
extent that they conflict with the  provisions of this Code.  The Fund's and its
Adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act and the more detailed  policies and  procedures of the Primary  Service
Providers  as set  forth  in  their  respect  Compliance  Manuals  are  separate
requirements applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

VII. DISCLOSURE OF AMENDMENTS TO THE CODE

     Any  amendments  will, to the extent  required,  be disclosed in accordance
with law.

VIII. CONFIDENTIALITY


                                   Page 5 of 9

   AI Fund Policy: Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial
                                    Officers

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code or upon advice of counsel, such
reports  and  records  shall not be  disclosed  to anyone  other than the Fund's
Board,  the Covered  Officers,  the Code  Officer,  the CLO, the Fund's  Primary
Service Providers and their affiliates,  and outside audit firms,  legal counsel
to the Fund and legal counsel to the Independent Board Members.

X.   INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
