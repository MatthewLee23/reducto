 *    As a result of recent changes in generally accepted accounting principles,
      the Fund has reclassified  periodic payments made under interest rate swap
      agreements,  previously included within interest income, as a component of
      realized  gain (loss) in the statement of  operations.  The effect of this
      reclassification  was to  increase  net  investment  income  and  decrease
      realized gain by $4,302,270.

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.  (the  "Equity  Trust") is a
closed-end,   non-diversified  management  investment  company  organized  as  a
Maryland corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  whose primary  objective is long-term
growth of capital.  The Equity  Trust had no  operations  until August 11, 1986,
when it sold 10,696 shares of common stock to Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser")
for $100,008. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

      Effective  August 1, 2002, the Equity Trust  modified its  non-fundamental
investment  policy to increase,  from 65% to 80%, the portion of its assets that
it will invest,  under normal market  conditions in equity  securities (the "80%
Policy").  The 80% Policy may be changed without shareholder approval.  However,
the Equity Trust has adopted a policy to provide  shareholders  with at least 60
days' notice of the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") so  determines,  by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith, to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by the Adviser.

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close, market conditions change significantly, certain
foreign securities may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the
Board.  Debt instruments that are not credit impaired with remaining  maturities
of 60 days or less are valued at  amortized  cost,  unless the Board  determines
such does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these securities
will be valued at their fair value as determined by the Board.  Debt instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the latest average of the bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing  bid  price.  Futures  contracts  are  valued  at the  official  closing
settlement  price of the  exchange  or board  of trade on which  the  applicable
contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available  financial and non-financial  information about
the company;  comparisons  to the  valuation and changes in valuation of similar
securities,  including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S.
dollar value ADR securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.   The  Equity  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve  Bank of New York,  with member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System or
with other  brokers or dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the
Adviser  and  reviewed by the Board of  Directors.  Under the terms of a typical
repurchase  agreement,  the Equity Trust takes  possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase,  and the Equity
Trust to  resell,  the  obligation  at an  agreed-upon  price and time,  thereby
determining the yield during the Equity Trust's holding period. The Equity Trust
will always receive and maintain securities


                                       15
<PAGE>

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

as collateral whose market value,  including accrued interest,  will be at least
equal  to 102%  of the  dollar  amount  invested  by the  Equity  Trust  in each
agreement.  The Equity  Trust will make  payment for such  securities  only upon
physical  delivery or upon evidence of book entry  transfer of the collateral to
the  account of the  custodian.  To the extent that any  repurchase  transaction
exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is  marked-to-market  on a
daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the  collateral.  If the seller defaults
and the  value of the  collateral  declines  or if  bankruptcy  proceedings  are
commenced  with  respect  to the  seller  of the  security,  realization  of the
collateral by the Equity Trust may be delayed or limited.

      SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Equity Trust may enter into interest rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Equity  Trust would  agree to pay to the other party to the  interest
rate  swap  (which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate
payment in exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing to pay to the Equity  Trust
periodically a variable rate payment that is intended to approximate  the Equity
Trust's variable rate payment  obligation on the Series C Preferred Stock. In an
interest rate cap, the Equity Trust would pay a premium to the interest rate cap
to the  counterparty  and, to the extent that a  specified  variable  rate index
exceeds a predetermined fixed rate, would receive from the counterparty payments
of the difference  based on the notional amount of such cap.  Interest rate swap
and cap  transactions  introduce  additional risk because the Equity Trust would
remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock  dividends when due in accordance with
the Articles Supplementary even if the counterparty defaulted.  Depending on the
general state of short-term interest rates and the returns on the Equity Trust's
portfolio  securities  at that point in time,  such a default  could  negatively
affect the Equity  Trust's  ability to make  dividend  payments for the Series C
Preferred  Stock.  In  addition,  at the  time  an  interest  rate  swap  or cap
transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,  there is a risk that the
Equity Trust will not be able to obtain a  replacement  transaction  or that the
terms  of  the  replacement  will  not  be  as  favorable  as  on  the  expiring
transaction.  If this  occurs,  it could  have a  negative  impact on the Equity
Trust's ability to make dividend payments on the Series C Preferred Stock.

      The Trust has entered into one interest rate swap  agreement with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Trust receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2004 are as follows:

*     Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

      As a result of recent  FASB  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  consensus  (and
subsequent  related  SEC staff  guidance),  the  Equity  Trust has  reclassified
periodic payments made under interest rate swap agreement,  previously  included
within interest income,  as a component of realized gain (loss) in the statement
of operations.  For  consistency,  similar  reclassifications  have been made to
amounts  appearing in the previous year's statement of changes in net assets and
the per share  amounts in prior  years  financial  highlights.  Prior  years net
investment  income  ratios in the financial  highlights  have also been modified
accordingly.

      This  reclassification  increased net investment  income and decreased net
realized  gains by $4,302,270  and  $1,813,999  for the years ended December 31,
2003 and  December  31,  2002,  respectively,  but had no effect  on the  Equity
Trust's net asset  value,  either in total or per share,  or its total  increase
(decrease) in net assets from operations during any period.

      For the years ended  December 31, 2003 and  December  31, 2002,  financial
highlights  reclassifications  were as follows:  net investment income per share
increased by $0.03 and $0.01,  respectively,  ratios of net investment income to
average net assets  attributable to common shares  increased by 0.47% and 0.18%,
respectively, ratios of operating expenses to average net assets attributable to
common  shares  decreased  by 0.47%  and  0.18%,  respectively,  and  ratios  of
operating  expenses to average total net assets including  liquidation  value of
preferred shares decreased by 0.33% and 0.13%, respectively.

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Equity Trust may engage in futures  contracts for
the purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities
and in the value of securities  it intends to purchase.  Such  investments  will
only be made if they are


                                       16
<PAGE>

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

economically appropriate to the reduction of risks involved in the management of
the Equity  Trust's  investments.  Upon  entering into a futures  contract,  the
Equity  Trust is required  to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or cash
equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.  This is known
as the "initial margin."  Subsequent payments  ("variation  margin") are made or
received by the Equity Trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuation of the
value of the  contract.  The daily  changes  in the  contract  are  included  in
unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on investments and futures contracts. The
Equity  Trust  recognizes  a realized  gain or loss when the contract is closed.
There were no open futures contracts at June 30, 2004.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged  investments.  In addition,  there is the risk the
Equity Trust may not be able to enter into a closing  transaction  because of an
illiquid secondary market.

      FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSACTIONS.  The books and records of the Equity Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments
and other  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  at the
exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period,  and purchases and sales of
investment  securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing on the respective  dates of such  transactions.  Unrealized gains and
losses,  which result from changes in foreign  exchange  rates and/or changes in
market    prices   of    securities,    have   been   included   in   unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency transactions.  Net
realized  foreign  currency gains and losses  resulting from changes in exchange
rates  include  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  between  trade  date  and
settlement  date  on  investment  securities   transactions,   foreign  currency
transactions  and the  difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends
recorded on the books of the Equity Trust and the amounts actually received. The
portion of foreign  currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in exchange
rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is included
in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

      DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to  shareholders  of the
Equity Trust's 7.20% Tax Advantaged Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock, Series
C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock, 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Stock,  and  Series E  Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Cumulative
Preferred  Stock") are accrued on a daily basis and are  determined as described
in Note 5.

      Income  dividends  and  capital  gain   distributions  are  determined  in
accordance with Federal income tax regulations  which may differ from accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States.  These  differences  are
primarily due to differing  treatments of income and gains on various investment
securities  held  by  the  Equity  Trust,   timing   differences  and  differing
characterization of distributions made by the Equity Trust.

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  reclassifications  were made to
increase  accumulated  distributions  in excess  of net  investment  income  for
$35,924 and decrease accumulated distributions in excess of net realized gain on

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      The tax character of amounts distributed in 2004 which exceed the ordinary
income of the Fund will be  treated as a  non-taxable  return of  capital.  Such
determination can only be made upon completion of the taxable year.

      PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Equity  Trust  intends to  continue  to
qualify as a regulated  investment  company  under  Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code").  It is the Trust's  policy to
comply with the  requirements  of the Code  applicable  to regulated  investment
companies  and to distribute  substantially  all of its net  investment  company
taxable income and net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income
taxes is required.

      As of December 31, 2003, the  components of accumulated  earnings/(losses)
on a tax basis were as follows:

            Net unrealized appreciation on investments .......    $ 222,707,582
            Net unrealized depreciation on foreign currency
              transactions and interest rate swaps ...........       (7,102,989)
            Other ............................................         (291,785)
                                                                  -------------
            Total accumulated gain ...........................    $ 215,312,808
                                                                  =============

      Other is primarily due to dividends payable on preferred stock at December
31, 2003.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Equity Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser  which  provides  that the  Equity  Trust  will pay the  Adviser  a fee,
computed weekly and paid monthly, equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value
of the  Equity  Trust's  average  weekly net assets  plus  liquidation  value of
preferred stock. In accordance with the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides
a continuous  investment  program for the Equity Trust's  portfolio and oversees
the  administration  of all aspects of the Equity Trust's  business and affairs.
The Adviser has agreed to reduce the  management fee on the  incremental  assets
attributable  to the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock if the total return of the net
asset value of the common  shares of the Equity Trust,  including  distributions
and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed the stated dividend rate
or corresponding swap rate of the Cumulative Preferred Stock.

      The  Equity  Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the  common
shares is monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the
net asset value of the common  shares  exceeds the stated  dividend  rate of the
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months  ended June 30,
2004,  the  Equity  Trust's  total  return on the net asset  value of the common
shares exceeded the stated dividend rate of the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock. Thus,  management fees were accrued on these assets, but not on
the  assets of the Series B,  Series C Auction  Rate,  and  Series D  Cumulative
Preferred Stock. Management fees were reduced by the amount of $1,838,314.

      During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2004,  Gabelli &  Company,  Inc.
received  $171,054 in  brokerage  commissions  as a result of  executing  agency
transactions in portfolio securities on behalf of the Equity Trust.

      The cost of calculating the Equity Trust's net asset value per share is an
Equity Trust expense pursuant to the Investment  Advisory  Agreement between the
Equity  Trust and the Adviser.  During the six months  ended June 30, 2004,  the
Equity  Trust  reimbursed  the Adviser  $17,400 in  connection  with the cost of
computing the Equity Trust's net asset value.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.   Cost  of  purchases  and  proceeds  from  sales  of
securities,  other than short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
2004 aggregated $121,094,964 and $56,678,127, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Equity Trust to issue 182,000,000 shares of
common stock (par value $0.001).  The Board of Directors of the Equity Trust has
authorized  the  repurchase of its shares on the open market when the shares are
trading at a discount of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board of
Directors may determine from time to time)

      The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of common stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with holders of shares of common stock as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of common
stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other things, changes in the Equity Trust's  subclassification
as a  closed-end  investment  company or changes in its  fundamental  investment
restrictions.  The  Equity  Trust's  Articles  of  Incorporation,   as  amended,
authorize the issuance of up to 16,006,000 shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock
and results in the financial  leveraging of the common  stock.  Such  leveraging
tends to  magnify  both the risks  and  opportunities  to  common  shareholders.
Dividends on shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative. The Equity
Trust is required to meet certain asset  coverage  tests as required by the 1940
Act and by the Shares'  Articles  Supplementary  with respect to the  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock. If the Equity Trust fails to meet these  requirements and does
not correct such failure, the Equity Trust may be required to redeem, in part or
in full, the 7.20% Series B, Series C Auction Rate,  5.875% Series D, and Series
E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $25, $25,000,
$25,  and  $25,000,  respectively,  per  share  plus  an  amount  equal  to  the
accumulated and unpaid dividends whether or not declared on such shares in order
to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the foregoing asset
requirements  could  restrict  the Equity  Trust's  ability to pay  dividends to
common  shareholders  and  could  lead  to  sales  of  portfolio  securities  at
inopportune  times. The income received on the Equity Trust's assets may vary in
a manner  unrelated to the fixed and variable  rates,  which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
common shareholders.

      Under  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  (EITF)   promulgating   Topic  D-98,
CLASSIFICATION  AND  MEASUREMENT OF REDEEMABLE  SECURITIES,  which was issued on
July 19, 2001, preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets
are to be  classified  outside  of  permanent  equity  to the  extent  that  the
redemption is at a fixed or  determinable  price and at the option of the holder
or upon the  occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the
issuer.  In  accordance  with the  guidance  of the  EITF,  the  Equity  Trust's
Cumulative Preferred Stock is classified outside of permanent equity (net assets
attributable  to  common  stock  shareholders)  in  the  accompanying  financial
statements.

      The Equity Trust,  as  authorized by the Board of Directors,  redeemed all
(5,367,900 shares) of its outstanding 7.25% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock.
The redemption date was June 17, 2003 and the redemption  price was $25.4078 per
Preferred Share, which consisted of $25.00 per Preferred Share (the "liquidation
value")  plus  accrued  dividends  through  the  redemption  date of $0.4078 per
Preferred  Share.  The  Preferred  Shares  were  callable  at  any  time  at the
liquidation  value of $25.00  per share plus  accrued  dividends  following  the
expiration of the five-year call protection on June 9, 2003.

Equity Trust, at its option, may redeem the 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Stock in whole or in part at the liquidation value price.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2004, the Equity Trust repurchased 50,300 shares of 5.875% Series
D Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in the open market at a cost of $1,185,193 and an
average discount of approximately 5.83% from its liquidation value of $25.00 per
share. All repurchased shares of 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock have
been  retired.  At June  30,  2004,  2,949,700  shares  of the  5.875%  Series D
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$36,103.

      On October 7, 2003,  the Equity Trust received net proceeds of $49,260,000
(after  underwriting  discounts of $500,000 and estimated  offering  expenses of
$240,000)  from the public  offering  of 2,000  shares of Series E Auction  Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is  generally  held  every 7 days,  is  expected  to vary with  short-term
interest rates.  The Rates of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
ranged  from 1.02% to 1.47% for the six months  ended  June 30,  2004.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit  an order to hold,  bid or sell  such  shares  on each
auction date. Series E Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock shareholders may
also trade shares in the secondary market.  The Equity Trust, at its option, may
redeem the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part
at the liquidation value price at any time. During the six months ended June 30,
2004,  the Equity Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of Series E Auction Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At June 30,  2004,  2,000  shares of the Series E
Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  with an annualized
dividend rate of 1.47 percent and accrued dividends amounted to $12,250.

6. OTHER  MATTERS.  On October 7, 2003, the Equity  Trust's  Adviser  received a
subpoena  from  the  Attorney  General  of  the  State  of New  York  requesting
information  on mutual  fund  shares  trading  practices.  The  Adviser has also
received  requests for  information  from the SEC regarding  mutual fund trading
practices  and valuation of portfolio  securities.  The Adviser has responded to
the  requests.  The Equity Trust does not believe that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Equity Trust's financial  position or the results
of its operations.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Equity  Trust  enters into  contracts  that contain a
variety of  indemnifications.  The Equity Trust's  maximum  exposure under these
arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Equity Trust has not had prior claims or
losses pursuant to these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

      offering, assuming full subscription by shareholder.  Total return for the
      period of less than one year is not annualized.

(a)   Per share amounts have been  calculated  using the monthly  average shares
      outstanding method.

(b)   A distribution equivalent to $0.75 per share for The Gabelli Utility Trust
      spin-off from net investment income,  realized short-term gains,  realized
      long-term gains, and paid-in-capital were $0.01029, $0.07453, $0.34218 and
      $0.32300, respectively.

         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for

         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  [Omitted]

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred   during  the
              registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
              fiscal  half-year  in the  case  of an  annual  report)  that  has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

<PAGE>


         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
