The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2005

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team,
led by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET CONDITIONS

The senior loan market demonstrated continued strength for the 12-month period
ended July 31, 2005. Despite rising oil prices, the pace of economic growth
stayed on track and inflation remained contained. Many corporations posted
earnings announcements that reflected healthy balance sheets and well-executed
strategies. A weakening U.S. dollar further benefited a number of companies
within the senior loan market, including those in the chemical, steel, and
forest product and paper industries. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports more
competitive in foreign markets, while making foreign imports more expensive to
U.S. consumers). Against this backdrop of enhanced profitability, the credit
quality of corporate debt improved and helped to boost the senior loan market.

Companies actively took advantage of this favorable environment and issued a
significant amount of new senior loans during the period. This issuance was more
than met by investor demand, which was strong across both the primary and
secondary markets. Continuing the trends of recent years, improving credit
qualities and significantly lower default rates encouraged increased
participation in the senior loan market, particularly among institutional
investors. The sector's appeal was further enhanced by rising short- and
intermediate-term interest rates, which buoyed the yields of senior loans and
underscored the defensive characteristics of the asset class. (The yields of
senior loans adjust in response to changes in short-term interest rates.)

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period.

For the 12 months ended July 31, 2005, the trust returned -2.03 percent on a
market price basis and 6.36 percent on an NAV basis.

Seeking to balance attractive yields with a relatively stable net asset value,
we followed a disciplined investment approach which was anchored by our rigorous
fundamental research. Consistent with our long-standing practice, the portfolio
construction process focused upon identifying companies with strong management,
solid and predictable cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of
default. It is our view that the merits of this approach are reflected in the
portfolio's performance for the 12-month period and likely would be further
evidenced during a cyclical downturn.

To manage overall risk, we diversified the portfolio's assets across both
individual securities and sectors. While individual security selection drives
the investment process, we also carefully weighed broader sectors. As we have
historically, we generally eschewed the debt of cyclical companies, whose
fortunes may be particularly vulnerable to changes in the economy, preferring
instead senior loans from sectors with greater potential stability throughout
the economic cycle.

Accordingly, our investment discipline led us to more-defensive segments of the
market. We favored the defense industry, where long-term demand trends remain
supportive and companies hold considerable hard assets. We emphasized companies
that offer goods and services used on a regular basis, including food, drug and
beverage companies and ecological (waste management) companies. Meanwhile, we
were particularly cautious with automotive debt. Given the ongoing travails of
the auto sector, the outlook for specific automotive manufacturers and their
suppliers remains clouded. We avoided homebuilders due to their extreme
vulnerability to the fortunes of the real estate market; as well as

                                                                               3

clothing manufacturers, where overseas competition has increased sharply. We
were similarly circumspect in regard to the telecommunications sector. Here too,
competition has been fierce, dominant technologies have changed rapidly, and
companies tend not to hold significant hard-asset collateral.

The trust benefited during the period from our use of leverage. Leverage
involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate and reinvesting the proceeds at
a higher rate. We use this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance
the trust's dividend. Unlike with other fixed-income classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates, since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the trust's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline.) We are likely to reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality
conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the trust's net asset value.

As of the close of the reporting period, our analysis suggests continued bright
prospects for the senior loan market, and we look forward to pursuing the most
compelling opportunities. The economy has shown continued signs of growth, and
corporate profits and pricing power have remained largely intact for the
borrowers in the senior loan market. Such factors, in our view, support a
favorable environment for continued free cash flow and our expectation that
credit quality will not weaken significantly. That said, we intend to view with
added caution those companies that are heavily exposed to fuel prices.

There is no guarantee the security sectors mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the trust in the future.

INVESTMENT POLICY CHANGES

       At a meeting held March 2 and March 3, 2005 the Board of Trustees
       approved a change to the Trust's respective investment policies regarding
       the current investment requirements for senior notes. The changes modify
       the current limitation on senior notes. Such modification allows
       investments in senior notes provided that senior notes represent the only
       form of senior debt financing in the borrower's capital structure or
       enjoy a pair passu position with other senior loans in the borrower's
       capital structure with respect to collateral only and not with respect to
       the other covenants and terms.

       trust's second and fourth fiscal quarters by filing the schedule
       electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
       semiannual reports are filed on Form N-CSRS and the annual reports are
       filed on Form N-CSR. Van Kampen also delivers the semiannual and annual
       reports to trust shareholders, and makes these reports available on its

       annual reports that Van Kampen delivers to shareholders and makes
       available through the Van Kampen public Web site, each trust files a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the trust's
       first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van Kampen does not deliver
       the reports for the first and third fiscal quarters to shareholders, nor
       are the reports posted to the Van Kampen public Web site. You may,

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 25, 2005, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the contract over a
period of several months and the non-management trustees held sessions both with
the investment adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and
considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of factors
control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all factors
together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval

<PAGE>

of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and
its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain matters
considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, a performance committee of the
Board spends more focused time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in
the Van Kampen complex, paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the performance goals and the
actual results achieved in managing the Fund. When considering a fund's
performance, the trustees and the investment adviser place emphasis on trends
and longer-term returns (focusing on one-year, three-year and five-year
performance with special attention to three-year performance) and, when a fund's
weighted performance is under the fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and
where necessary seek to make specific changes to investment strategy or
investment personnel. The Fund discloses more information about its performance
elsewhere in this report. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser the
level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to comparable funds and other
products advised by the adviser and others in the marketplace. The trustees
review not only the advisory fees but other fees and expenses (whether paid to
the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The
Board has determined that the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support
its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of a special ad hoc
committee of the Board. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser its
revenues and expenses, including among other things, revenues for advisory
services, portfolio management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement
costs and allocated expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

Board has determined that the analysis of the investment adviser's expenses and
profitability support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and it affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets applicable
    to common shares.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    commitments.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(f) Restricted Security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.04%
    of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

(g) Payment-in-kind security.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2005.

(i) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

   return would have been lower and the Ratio of Operating Expenses to Average
   Net Assets, Ratio of Gross Expenses to Average Net Assets and the Ratio of
   Net Investment Income to Average Net Assets would have been 1.21%, 1.49% and

** Non-Annualized

(a)Net asset value on June 24, 1998 of $10.00 is adjusted for common share
   offering costs of $.013.

(b)Total return based on common share market price assumes an investment at the
   common share market price at the beginning of the period indicated,
   reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
   Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing
   common share market price at the end of the period indicated.

(c)Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
   senior loan interests.

(d)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   Borrowings) from the Trust's total assets and dividing by the total number of
   senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
   indebtedness.

(e)As required, effective August 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the year ended July 31, 2002 was to decrease the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
   investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses
   per share were unaffected by the adjustments. Per share, ratios and

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon

 38

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the
custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying
security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2005, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $211,408,105 which will expire according to the following
schedule.

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

                                                                              39

                                                              $102,806,311    $75,570,307
                                                              ============    ===========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A permanent difference
related to book to tax amortization differences totaling $407,523 has been
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss.

    As of July 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $5,272,503
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions, other losses that were recognized for book purposes but not
tax purposes at the end of the fiscal year and post October losses which are not
realized for tax purposes until the first day of the following fiscal year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the year ended July 31, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $105,300 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the Trust
is a partner of such firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as
legal counsel to the Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO")
Employment agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides
compliance services to the Trust. The costs of these services are allocated to
each trust. For the year ended July 31,

 40

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

2005, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $101,800, representing Van
Kampen Investment Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing legal services to the Trust, as well as, the salary, benefits and
related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services
provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported as part of
"Legal" expenses on the Statement of Operations. Services provided pursuant to
the CCO Employment agreement are reported as part of "Other" expenses on the
Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable for a ten-year period
and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust. The maximum
annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

    During the period, the Trust owned shares of the following affiliated
companies. Affiliated companies are defined by the 1940 Act, as amended, as
those companies in which a fund holds 5% or more of the outstanding voting
securities.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the costs of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $2,688,239,856 and
$2,578,599,825, respectively.

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Trust had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $179,349,844 as of July 31, 2005. The
Trust intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating
cash, liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,299,702 as of July 31, 2005 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

5. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

    At July 31, 2005, the Trust had no selling participants with respect to
interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation basis.

6. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, as amended, a fund generally may
not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the fund's total assets or (ii)
issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the fund's total assets. In using a
combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum
allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more
that 50%) of the Fund's total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or
preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. For the year ended July 31, 2005, the average daily balance of borrowings
under the revolving credit agreement was $512,060,274 with a weighted average
interest rate of 2.46%.

7. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

As of February 20, 2004, the Trust issued 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series
T, Series W, Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), $.01 Par
Value, $25,000 liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $700 million.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on July 31, 2005 was
3.198%. During the year ended July 31, 2005, the rates ranged from 1.490% to
3.610%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

 42
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              43

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior >Income Trust

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust"),
as of July 31, 2005, the related statements of operations and cash flows for the
year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the six years in the
period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. The Trust's financial highlights for the period ended prior to July 31,
2000 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated September 14, 1999,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of July 31, 2005 by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust as of July 31, 2005, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the six years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. Common Shareholders who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash paid by check mailed
directly to the Common Shareholder by the Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for the
Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              45

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. If you withdraw, you will receive, without
charge, a share certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares
credited to your account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any
fractional Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again
elect to participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or
writing to the Trust at:

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

(a)      The Trust has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Trust or
a third party.

(b)      No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c)      The Trust has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by
the shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C were amended during
the period. Exhibit B was then amended again in March 2005 and a third time in
August 2005. All three editions of Exhibit B are attached.

(d)      Not applicable.

(e)      Not applicable.

(f)
         (1)      The Trust's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit 12A.
         (2)      Not applicable.
         (3)      Not applicable.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has one "audit committee
financial expert" serving on its audit committee, "independent" Trustee Rod
Dammeyer. Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an
audit committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee
financial expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties,
obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and
liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different
period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and
pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent Auditors
without obtaining specific pre-approval

- ------------------------
(1)      This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
         Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above,
         supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been amended
         from time to time.

(2)      Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have
         the meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.


<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.


2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix
B.1. All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).


4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.
<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large
and complex transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be
provided by the Independent Auditors to any executive officer or
trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual
capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable
only to internally managed investment companies).


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

         A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.


7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.


9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.


10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:


         -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.
         -    Van Kampen Asset Management
         -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.
         -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.
         -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.

         -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.
         -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company
         -    Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.


(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f)    Not applicable.

(g)    See table above.

(h)    The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Trust has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are:

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.       POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable
investment advisory agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as
authorized by the Board of Directors or Trustees of the MSIM Funds. A MSIM
Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA




<PAGE>

account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of an account not
governed by ERISA, the investment management or investment advisory agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which the MSIM Affiliates manage assets, consistent with the objective of
maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain
situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a proxy
voting policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the
client's policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or
regulations or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.


II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that




<PAGE>

arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in
accordance with the following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved
by the Proxy Review Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.
A MSIM Affiliate will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected
security between the record date and the meeting date.



III.     GUIDELINES

A.       CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS.  The following proposals will generally
be voted as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review
Committee.

         i.       General.

         1.       Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
                  following are examples of routine management proposals:


                  o        Approval of financial statements, director and
                           auditor reports.

                  o        General updating/corrective amendments to the
                           charter.

                  o        Proposals related to the conduct of the annual
                           meeting, except those proposals that relate to the
                           "transaction of such other business which may come
                           before the meeting."

         2.       Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be
                  supported; proposals to establish cumulative voting in the
                  election of directors will not be supported.

         3.       Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent
                  tabulation of voting results will be supported.

         4.       Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman
                  and CEO will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S.
                  companies to have a separate Chairman and CEO will be
                  supported.

         5.       Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items
                  that are clearly related to the regular course of business
                  will be supported.

         6.       Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will
                  be supported.

         7.       Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be
                  supported. However, where management specifically states the
                  reason for requesting an adjournment and the requested
                  adjournment is necessary to permit a proposal that would
                  otherwise be supported under this Policy to be carried out
                  (i.e. an uncontested corporate transaction), the adjournment
                  request will be supported.


         8.       Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management
                  supports a classified board) generally will not be supported.
<PAGE>
         9.       Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are
                  costly to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or
                  expenditures that are of a non-business nature or would
                  provide no pertinent information from the perspective of
                  institutional shareholders generally will not be supported.

         ii.      Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists
         and where no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless
         otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be
         voted in support of nominees of management.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:
                                                                     -
                  o   Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66
                      2/3%) of the company's board members be independent
                      directors.

                  o   Proposals requiring that members of the company's
                      compensation, nominating and audit committees be comprised
                      of independent or unaffiliated directors.

         2.       Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a
                  withhold vote will be made in the following circumstances:

                  (a) If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
                      disinsterested directors, a withhold vote will be made for
                      interested directors. A director nominee may be deemed to
                      be interested if the nominee has, or any time during the
                      previous five years had, a relationship with the issuer
                      (e.g., investment banker, counsel or other professional
                      service provider, or familial relationship with a senior
                      officer of the issuer) that may impair his or her
                      independence;

                  (b) If a nominee who is interested is standing for election as
                      a member of the company's compensation, nominating or
                      audit committees;

                  (c) A direct conflict exists between the interests of the
                      nominee and the public shareholders;

                  (d) Where the nominees standing for election have not taken
                      action to implement generally accepted governance
                      practices for which there is a "bright line" test. These
                      would include elimination of dead hand or slow hand poison
                      pills, requiring audit, compensation or nominating
                      committees to be composed of independent directors and
                      requiring a majority independent board;

                  (e) A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board
                      meetings within a given year without a reasonable excuse;
                      or

                  (f) A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than
                      six companies (excluding investment companies).

         iii.     Auditors
<PAGE>

         1.       Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification
                  of auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not
                  be supported if the audit fees are excessive. Generally, to
                  determine if audit fees are excessive, a 50% test will be
                  applied for audit fees in excess of $1 million: if audit fees
                  are $1 million or more, non-audit fees should less than 50% of
                  the total fees paid to the auditor. If audit fees are less
                  than $1 million, the fees will be reviewed case by case by the
                  Proxy Review Committee.

         2.       Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
                  shareholders will be supported.

         3.       Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

         iv.      Anti-Takeover Matters



         1.       Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
                  requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
                  proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority
                  shareholder vote to pass or repeal certain provisions will not
                  be supported.

         2.       Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail
                  provisions will be supported, provided that the proposal: (i)
                  defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to large
                  block holders (holders of at least 1% of the outstanding
                  shares and in certain cases, a greater amount, as determined
                  by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all shareholders or
                  not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii) contains
                  no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
                  rights of shareholders.


         3.       Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
                  shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.


B.       CAPITALIZATION CHANGES.  The following proposals generally will be
voted as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review
Committee.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:

                  o        Proposals relating to capitalization changes that
                           eliminate other classes of stock and/or eliminate
                           unequal voting rights.

                  o        Proposals to increase the authorization of existing
                           classes of common stock (or securities convertible
                           into common stock) if: (i) a clear and legitimate
                           business purpose is stated; (ii) the number of shares
                           requested is reasonable in relation to the purpose
                           for which authorization is requested; and (iii) the
                           authorization does not exceed 100% of shares
                           currently authorized and at least 30% of the new
                           authorization will be outstanding.

                  o        Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or
                           for issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued
                           capital.

                  o        Proposals for share repurchase plans.


<PAGE>

                  o        Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares
                           of common or preferred stock, or to eliminate classes
                           of preferred stock.

                  o        Proposals to effect stock splits.

                  o        Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if
                           management proportionately reduces the authorized
                           share amount set forth in the corporate charter.
                           Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
                           proportionately to the authorized share amount
                           generally will be approved if the resulting increase
                           in authorized shares coincides with the proxy
                           guidelines set forth above for common stock
                           increases.

         2.       The following proposals generally will not be supported
                  (notwithstanding management support).

                  o        Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add
                           classes of stock which substantially dilute the
                           voting interests of existing shareholders.

                  o        Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares
                           of existing classes of stock that carry preemptive
                           rights or supervoting rights.

                  o        Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

                  o        Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by
                           100% or more.

C.       COMPENSATION.  The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:

                  o        Proposals relating to director fees, provided the
                           amounts are not excessive relative to other companies
                           in the country or industry.


                  o        Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that
                           permit discounts up to 15%, but only for grants that
                           are part of a broad-based employee plan, including
                           all non-executive employees.


                  o        Proposals for the establishment of employee stock
                           option plans and other employee ownership plans,
                           provided that our research does not indicate that
                           approval of the plan would be against shareholder
                           interest.


                  o        Proposals for the establishment of employee
                           retirement and severance plans, provided that our
                           research does not indicate that approval of the plan
                           would be against shareholder interest.

         2.       Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all
                  severance agreements will not be supported, however, proposals
                  that require shareholder approval for agreements in excess of
                  three times the annual compensation (salary and bonus)
                  generally will be supported.

         3.       Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive
                  compensation generally will not be supported.
<PAGE>

         4.       Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive
                  compensation in addition to the disclosure required by the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations
                  generally will not be supported.

D.       OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted
as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

         1.       Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
                  environmental or special interest issues that do not relate
                  directly to the business of the company and which do not
                  appear to be directed specifically to the business or
                  financial interest of the company generally will not be
                  supported.

         2.       Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are
                  not required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals
                  relate will not be supported.

E.       ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.


         I.       CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS

                  o   Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other
                      special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers,
                      spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations,
                      restructurings and recapitalizations) will be examined on
                      a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Research Providers'
                      research and analysis will be used along with MSIM
                      Affiliates' research and analysis, including, among other
                      things, MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.
                      Proposals for mergers or other significant transactions
                      that are friendly, approved by the Research Providers, and
                      where there is no portfolio manager objection, generally
                      will be supported.

         ii.      Compensation

                  o   Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in
                      non-salary compensation plans, employment contracts, and
                      severance agreements that benefit management and would be
                      costly to shareholders if triggered. With respect to
                      proposals related to severance and change of control
                      situations, MSIM Affiliates will support a maximum of
                      three times salary and bonus.

                  o   Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option
                      plans. Generally, stock option plans should be incentive
                      based. The Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the
                      quantitative criteria used by a Research Provider when
                      considering such Research Provider's recommendation. If
                      the Proxy Review Committee determines that the criteria
                      used by the Research Provider is reasonable, the proposal
                      will be supported if it falls within a 5% band above the
                      Research Provider's threshold.
<PAGE>

o                     Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock
                      options that have not been offered to employees in
                      general.


         iii.     Other

                  o   Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

                  o   Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring
                      specific levels of stock ownership by directors.

                  o   Proposals for election of directors, where a director
                      nominee is related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board
                      of Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management)
                      must be considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the
                      proposal relates to a director nominee who is on a Van
                      Kampen Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees, to the extent
                      that the shares of the relevant company are held by a Van
                      Kampen Fund, the Van Kampen Board shall vote the proxies
                      with respect to those shares, to the extent practicable.
                      In the event that the Committee cannot contact the Van
                      Kampen Board in advance of the shareholder meeting, the
                      Committee will vote such shares pursuant to the Proxy
                      Voting Policy.

                  o   Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating
                      to broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

                  o   Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
                      indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
                      Committee will support such proposals provided that the
                      officers and directors are eligible for indemnification
                      and liability protection if they have acted in good faith
                      on company business and were found innocent of any civil
                      or criminal charges for duties performed on behalf of the
                      company.

IV.      ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A.       PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

         1.       The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible
                  for creating and implementing the Policy and, in this regard,
                  has expressly adopted it.

                  (a)      The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief
                           Investment Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior
                           investment professionals who represent the different
                           investment disciplines and geographic locations of
                           the firm. The Committee is responsible for
                           establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM
                           will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

                  (b)      The Committee will periodically review and have the
                           authority to amend, as necessary, the Policy and
                           establish and direct voting positions consistent with
                           the Client Proxy Standard.


                  (c)      The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among
                           other matters): (1) address any outstanding issues
                           relating to the Policy and (2) review proposals at
                           upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM portfolio


<PAGE>

                           companies in accordance with this Policy including,
                           as appropriate, the voting results of prior
                           shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a
                           similar proposal was presented to shareholders. The
                           Committee, or its designee, will timely communicate
                           to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments to them
                           and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may
                           adopt).

                  (d)      The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among
                           other matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e.,
                           allowing certain shares of the same issuer that are
                           the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held
                           by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
                           differently than other shares) and/or "override
                           voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a
                           manner contrary to the Policy); (2) review and
                           approve upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters
                           for which specific direction has been provided in
                           this Policy; and (3) determine how to vote matters
                           for which specific direction has not been provided in
                           this Policy. Split votes generally will not be
                           approved within a single Global Investor Group
                           investment team. The Committee may take into account
                           Research Providers' recommendations and research as
                           well as any other relevant information they may
                           request or receive, including portfolio manager
                           and/or analyst research, as applicable. Generally,
                           proxies related to securities held in accounts that
                           are managed pursuant to quantitative, index or
                           index-like strategies ("Index Strategies") will be
                           voted in the same manner as those held in actively
                           managed accounts. Because accounts managed using
                           Index Strategies are passively managed accounts,
                           research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
                           related to securities held in these accounts may not
                           be available. If the affected securities are held
                           only in accounts that are managed pursuant to Index
                           Strategies, and the proxy relates to a matter that is
                           not described in this Policy, the Committee will
                           consider all available information from the Research
                           Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
                           significant, from the portfolio managers and/or
                           analysts.

                  (e)      In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                           Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                           material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                           appearance of a potential material conflict of
                           interest, the Committee will request a special
                           committee to review, and recommend a course of action
                           with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                           ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee shall be
                           comprised of the Chairperson of the Proxy Review
                           Committee, the Compliance Director for the area of
                           the firm involved or his/her designee, a senior
                           portfolio manager (if practicable, one who is a
                           member of the Proxy Review Committee) designated by
                           the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's Chief
                           Investment Officer or his/her designee. The Special
                           Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's
                           General Counsel or his/her designee and will have
                           sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to the
                           research provided by Research Providers, the Special
                           Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate
                           investment professionals and outside sources to the
                           extent it deems appropriate.
<PAGE>

                  (f)      The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will document in writing all of their
                           decisions and actions, which documentation will be
                           maintained by the Committee and the Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of at
                           least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate
                           to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                           investment company, the Committee and Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
                           decisions to each applicable Board of
                           Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at
                           each Board's next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
                           The report will contain information concerning
                           decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee
                           during the most recently ended calendar quarter
                           immediately preceding the Board meeting.

                  (g)      The Committee and Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will timely communicate to applicable
                           portfolio managers, the Compliance Departments and,
                           as necessary, to ISS, decisions of the Committee and
                           Special Committee so that, among other things, ISS
                           will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

         B.       IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  1.  If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a
                      material conflict of interest, the vote must be decided by
                      the Special Committee in consultation with MSIM's General
                      Counsel or his/her designee.

                  2.  A material conflict of interest could exist in the
                      following situations, among others:

                  (a) The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an
                      affiliate of MSIM and the vote is on a material matter
                      affecting the issuer;

                  (b) The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any
                      other security issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates;
                      or

                  (c) Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the
                      matter submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial
                      advisor to a party to a merger or acquisition for which
                      Morgan Stanley will be paid a success fee if completed).

         C.       PROXY VOTING REPORTS

                  (a)      MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to
                           any client requesting them. MSIM will also, upon
                           client request, promptly provide a report indicating
                           how each proxy was voted with respect to securities
                           held in that client's account.

                  (b)      MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an
                           annual Form N-PX on behalf of each registered
                           management investment company for which such filing
                           is required, indicating how all proxies were voted
                           with respect to such investment company's holdings.

                ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and



<PAGE>

its investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers or
employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in
the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
investment adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Fund and its
investment adviser. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities
is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the investment
adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with the
provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such
activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
recognized by the Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly);

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         o        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;


<PAGE>

         o        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;

         o        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         o        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         o        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.




- ---------------------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."


<PAGE>

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         o        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         o        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         o        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         o        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         o        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or
C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused

          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
