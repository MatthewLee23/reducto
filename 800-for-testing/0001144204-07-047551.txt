The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
include, among others, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the
Dominican Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica,
Panama, Colombia, the United States and Venezuela. The fund invests at least 80%
of its total assets in a broad range of securities of issuers including
U.S.-based companies, which engage in substantial trade with and derive
substantial revenue from operations in the Caribbean Basin Countries.

                                                         Chairman and President

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

I'm pleased to report that our Fund's investments have been doing very well. As
of June 30, 2007 the end of our fiscal year, the Fund's net asset value was
$9.77 per share, which represents a gain of 31.08% for the one year period then
ended (adjusted for distributions). The Fund's share price closed the fiscal
year at $13.59 per share, up from $7.57 per share on June 30, 2006 and
representing a 94.61% gain for the year (adjusted for distributions). A
long-term capital gains distribution of $1.00 per share was paid in January,
2007 to shareholders of record December 15, 2006.

The Fund traded at a premium to net asset value most of the fiscal year,
reflecting strong interest by investors. At the same time, events in the
Caribbean, and especially in Cuba, have sparked interest in future investment
opportunities in the region.

It is now a little over a year since Fidel Castro went into the hospital and
turned over power to his brother Raul. Speculation, both publicly and privately,
about Fidel's health as well as the future of Cuba's foreign policy towards the
U.S., continues to vary greatly. In my view, any consideration of a change in
U.S. policy is likely to take place toward the end of this year, especially if
Cuba were to make the first gesture., i.e., release the political prisoners
and/or announce plans for free elections.

We continue to position the Fund's portfolio in companies we believe will
benefit from resumption of trade with Cuba and we have a very good working list
of companies we would add to the portfolio once it appears the embargo will be
lifted. In this regard, we believe it would be in the shareholders' best
interest to have a larger pool of capital available for investment whenever
these opportunities present themselves, rather than be forced to liquidate
existing holdings. For this and other reasons, the Board of Directors has
approved a rights offering.

Rights Offering

Very shortly you will be receiving information from the Fund regarding a rights
offering. A rights offering allows current shareholders to buy additional shares
of the Fund at a discount to the average market price of the shares on the
expiration date of the offer. The rights will be non-transferable, meaning they
cannot be sold and can only be used by shareholders of record to subscribe for
new shares. It is expected that one right will be required to subscribe for each
new share, and any shares not subscribed for will be made available to other
shareholders through an over-subscription privilege. If the subscription price
is higher than the Fund's net asset value on the pricing date, the Fund will
also have the option of issuing additional new shares to fulfill
over-subscription requests.

Please watch for mailings from the Fund as your response will be required before
the expiration of the rights offer in order to participate. The shares issued in
connection with the rights offering will be sold by prospectus only. The
prospectus contains important information about the Fund including information
about its investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses.

Please read the prospectus carefully before you make your decision. A
registration statement relating to the rights offering has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, but has not yet become effective. The
statements herein regarding the rights offering shall not constitute an offer to
sell or the solicition of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the
securities to be offered in any state in which such offer, solicition or sale
would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the
securities laws of any such state. We are available at 305-271-1900 if you have
questions about the offer or how to participate.

Appointment of New Independent Director

I am pleased to announce that Kay W. Tatum, Ph.D., CPA has joined the Fund's
Board of Directors as an independent director. Dr. Tatum replaces Albert L.
Weintraub who retired from the Board in July at the age of 77. We thank Mr.
Weintraub for his dedication to the Fund over the eight years he served on the
board.

We are honored to have Dr. Tatum as part of the Board. She is currently Chair
and Associate Professor of Accounting at the University of Miami's School of
Business Administration. In addition, Dr. Tatum has served on the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board's initial Standing Advisory Group, and was a member
of the American Institute of Public Accountant's International Auditing
Standards Subcommittee. Her articles on audit-related topics have appeared in
the Journal of Accountancy and The CPA Journal. Dr. Tatum is also a contributing
author to the book Audit Committees: A Guide for Directors, Management and
Consultants.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ capital market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment policy is to invest at least 80% of its assets in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries. The Fund's
investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund
pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental and may not be changed without the approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At June 30, 2007, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands representing approximately 21% and
8% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is State Street Bank & Trust Company
("SSBT"), based in Boston, Massachusetts.

Security Valuation

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ national market or capital market) are stated at the last reported
sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price);
other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid price.
Restricted securities and other securities for which quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors.

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
(SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

accordance with generally accepted accounting principals and expands disclosure
about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement
disclosures.

In February, 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities -
including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159
permits entities to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at
fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that
begins after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 159 wil have on the Fund's financial statements.

Income Recognition

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign
securities, as soon as the Fund is notified, and interest income is recognized
on an accrual basis. Pursuant to a custodian agreement, SSBT receives a fee
reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance
the Fund maintains with SSBT. Credit balances used to reduce the Fund's
custodian fees for the year ended June 30, 2007, were approximately $8,927.
Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized over the life
of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include the portion
of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments denominated in
foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and losses on
investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported


                                     - 15 -

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investments in securities, at market value include 45,000 common shares of
Xcelera, Inc. purchased for $73,890 and $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic
of Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. Shares of Xcelera are no longer being
traded in over-the-couonter markets. The bonds are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A Oregulatory haltO on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July 1995. As of June 30,
2007, these positions were valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which
approximates the positions' fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the year
ended June 30, 2007 amounted to $208,505 of which $57,753 is payable at year
end.

During the year ended June 30, 2007, the Fund paid approximately $12,000 of
brokerage commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the
Advisor, at an average cost per share of $0.036.

A director of the Fund serves on the Board of Directors of Margo Caribe, Inc., a
company in which the Fund has an investment.

A director of the Fund is the owner of the Advisor and Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co.,
Inc.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended June 30, 2007, purchases and sales of investment
securities were $3,999,212 and $5,476,205, respectively.

At June 30, 2007, the Fund's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of
$7,999,350 and gross unrealized losses of $442,262, resulting in a net
unrealized gain of $7,557,088.

NOTE 5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

On November 16, 2006, a long-term capital gain distribution of $1,677,636 ($1.00
per share) was declared. The distribution was paid on January 12, 2007 to
shareholders of record on December 15, 2006.

For financial statement purposes, the Fund's net investment loss for the year
ended June 30, 2007 differs from the net investment loss for tax purposes due to
the tax characterization of certain dividends received by the Fund. Realized
gains differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily due to differing
treatments of wash sales.

The cost basis of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower
than the cost basis for income tax purposes by $11,339 due to wash sale
adjustments.

As of June 30, 2007, undistributed realized gains were $1,670,170, gross
unrealized gains were $7,988,011, and gross unrealized losses were $442,262 for
income tax purposes.

Permanent differences accounted for during the year ended June 30, 2007 result
from differences between book and tax accounting. Such amounts have been
reclassified as follows:

                                              Accumulated Net
                          Accumulated Net    Realized Gain on    Additional Paid

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June, 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides
guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Fund is currently evaluating the
impact of applying the various provisions of FIN 48.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended June 30, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Fund adopted
a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, dividends and
distributions to shareholders who participate in the Plan are automatically
reinvested in shares of common stock. The Plan provides for the payment of
dividends to participants in the Plan with either (i) newly issued shares of
common stock of the Fund in the event the market price of the common stock is
trading on the open market at a premium to net asset value, or (ii) shares
purchased on the open market in the event the market price of the shares are
traded at a discount to net asset value.

For the year ended June 30, 2007, the Fund issued 9,920 shares for reinvestment
of distributions. The net effect of the reinvestment of distributions resulted
in an increase in net assets of $108,062.

NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Rights Offering

On July 24, 2007, the Fund announced plans for a non-transferable rights
offering and filed a registration statement on Form N-2 with the SEC to register
shares in connection with the rights offering. The rights will entitle the
holder to subscribe for one additional share of the Fund's common stock for each
right at a subscription price equal to a discount to the market price. Record
date stockholders who fully exercise their rights may participate in an
over-subscription privilege subject to certain limitations and allotment. Final
terms of the proposed offering, including the record date, subscription price
and subscription period, will be announced at a later date. The rights offering
will be made only by means of a prospectus. Subject to making the necessary
filings with the SEC and such filings becoming effective, it is expected that
the rights offering will be conducted in September or October of 2007.

New Independent Director

On August 7, 2007 the Fund announced the appointment of Kay W. Tatum, Ph.D., CPA
to the Board of Directors. Dr. Tatum replaces Albert L. Weintraub who retired
from the Board in July, 2007. Dr. Tatum will also serve as Chair of the Audit
Committee and as the audit committee financial expert.

On July 30, 2007, the Fund notified the staff of Nasdaq that due to Mr.
Weintraub's retirement, the Fund no longer complied with the Nasdaq's audit
committee composition requirements as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2)
requiring an audit committee comprised of three independent directors. On July
31, 2007, the Nasdaq provided notice to the Fund acknowledging the Fund's
notification of its non-compliance and apprising the Fund of the cure period
provided by Marketplace Rules 4350(c)(1) and 4350(d)(4). Upon notification to
Nasdaq of Dr. Tatum's appointment, the Nasdaq staff issued a letter on August 7,
2007 stating that the Fund now complies with the Marketplace Rule 4350 and that
the matter is closed.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockbrokers of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund,
Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") as of June 30, 2007, and the related statement of operations for the
years then ended, and the statement of changes in net assets and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits. The financial highlights for each of the years in the three
year period ended June 30, 2005 were audited by an independent registered
accounting firm whose reports dated July 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial highlights.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatements. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
the internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statement. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
owned as of June 30, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. as of June 30, 2007, the results of the
operations for the year then ended, the changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period ended, and the financial highlights for each of the two
years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(a) The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report, has

directors has determined that Albert L. Weintraub is an "audit committee
financial expert" serving on its audit committee and that he is "independent" as

registrant's annual financial statements and services provided by the Auditor in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings during and for the Registrant's
fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2006.

Fiscal Year                          Audit-Related        Tax       All Other
Ended June 30,      Audit Fees           Fees           Fees(1)      Fees(2)

2007                 $36,500            $4,500          $5,250         $0

(1) These fees related to services consisting of the review or preparation of
U.S. federal, state, local and excise tax returns

(2) These fees related to services consisting of accounting consultations,
agreed upon procedure reports, attestation reports, comfort letters and review

(e) The registrant's Audit Committee charter requires that the Audit Committee
pre-approve all auditing services and non-audit services (including the fees for
such services and terms thereof) to be performed for the registrant by its
Auditor, and the committee has not adopted pre-approval policies and procedures,
although it may determine to do so in the future. The engagement to render
auditing and non-auditing services would be presented to and pre-approved by the
Audit Committee. All of the audit, audit-related and tax services described

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

(a) The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee
established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. As of
June 30, 2007, the registrant's audit committee was comprised of Albert L.
Weintraub, Ann S. Lieff, and Michael A. Rubin. On August 1, 2007, Dr. Tatum
replaced Mr. Weintraub as a member of the Committee and serves as its
chairperson.

(b) Not applicable.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Not applicable as schedule is included as part of the report to shareholders
filed under Item 1 of this Form.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A copy of the registrant's proxy voting policies and procedures as well as its
adviser's policies and procedures are attached hereto as Appendix A.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

(a)(1) Thomas J. Herzfeld, Chairman and President of The Herzfeld Caribbean
Basin Fund, Inc. serves as the portfolio manager of the Fund and has held this
position since its inception in 1993. This information is as of August 30, 2007.

(a)(2)(i) and (ii) Mr. Herzfeld is also portfolio manager for approximately 44
private clients, however, none with an investment focus of investing in the
Caribbean Basin. The Fund is the only investment company managed by Mr.
Herzfeld; the Fund has total assets of approximately $16 million. Other accounts
have total assets of approximately $54 million.

(a)(2)(iii) No accounts are charged fees based on performance. For accounts
other than the Fund, fees are calculated as a percentage of the value of assets
under management at the end of each quarter.

(a)(2)(iv) The Fund does not believe that any material conflicts are likely to
arise through Mr. Herzfeld's management of other accounts in addition to the
Fund in that there is very little overlap in the type of investments made for
the Fund and other accounts, which generally trade shares of closed-end funds.
The Fund is permitted, to a limited extent, to buy shares of other closed-end
funds and occasionally other clients or Mr. Herzfeld may buy shares of
securities also held in the portfolio of the Fund. The advisor and the Fund have
adopted procedures overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") intended to
monitor compliance with such policies which include conflicts which may occur
regarding allocation of investment opportunities between the Fund and other
account. The CCO of the Fund reports directly to the Board of Directors at least
annually.

(3) Mr. Herzfeld receives no direct compensation from the Fund for his services
as Portfolio Manager. Mr. Herzfeld is 100% owner of the Advisor, a Subchapter S
Corporation, therefore he profits from the success of the Advisor and is taxed
on its profits.

(4)(a) Range of value of shares of the Fund owned by Mr. Herzfeld as of June 30,
2006: $100,001-$500,000.

(4)(b) Range of value of shares of the Fund owned by Mr. Herzfeld as of the date
of this filing: $100,001-$500,000.

                                   APPENDIX A
                     THE HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.
                       Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures

      The Board of Directors of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") hereby adopts the following policy and procedures with respect to voting
proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund:

Policy

      It is the policy of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") to
delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities
held by the Fund to the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") as a part of
the Adviser's general management of the Fund, subject to the Board's continuing
oversight.' The voting of proxies is an integral part of the investment
management services that the Adviser provides pursuant to the advisory contract.

      The Adviser may, but is not required to, delegate the responsibility for
voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund to a
sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser") retained to provide investment advisory services, if
applicable. If such responsibility is delegated to a Sub-Adviser, then the
Sub-Adviser shall assume the fiduciary duty and reporting responsibilities of
the Adviser under these policy guidelines.

Fiduciary Duty

      The right to vote a proxy with respect to portfolio securities held by the
Fund is an asset of the Fund. The Adviser, to which authority to vote on behalf
of the Fund is delegated, acts as a fiduciary of the Fund and must vote proxies
in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Procedures

      The following are the procedures adopted by the Board for the
administration of this policy:

      A. Review of Adviser Proxy Voting Procedures. The Adviser with authority
to vote proxies on behalf of the Fund shall present to the Board its policies,
procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies at least annually, and must
notify the Board promptly of material changes to any of these documents.

      B. Voting Record Reporting. No less than annually, the Adviser shall
report to the Board a record of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio
securities of the Fund during the year. With respect to those proxies that the
Adviser has identified as involving a conflict of interest(2), the Adviser shall
submit a separate report indicating the nature of the conflict of interest and
how that conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy.

Revocation

      The delegation by the Board of the authority to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Fund is entirely voluntary and may be revoked by the
Board, in whole or in part, at any time.

<PAGE>

Annual Filing

      The Fund shall file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
its portfolio securities during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX not later than August 31 of each year.

Disclosures

      The Fund shall include in its annual report to stockholders:

      A description of this policy and of the policies and procedures used by
the Adviser to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities
(3); and

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website(4).

      The Fund shall also include in its annual and semi-annual reports to
stockholders:

      A statement disclosing that a description of the policies and procedures
used by or on behalf of the Fund to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Funds is available without charge, upon request, by
calling the Fund's toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(5)

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's

Review of Policy.

At least annually, the Board shall review this Policy to determine its
sufficiency and shall make and approve any changes that it deems necessary from
time to time

                                  PROXY VOTING

                            POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


I.    POLICY

Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. (the "Adviser") acts as discretionary
investment adviser for various clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and clients governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").

Selected clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. have elected
to have the Adviser vote proxies or act on the other shareholder actions on
their behalf, while other clients vote proxies themselves.

When voting proxies or acting on corporate actions for clients, the Adviser's
utmost concern is that all decisions be made in the best interest of its clients
(for ERISA accounts, plan beneficiaries and participants, in accordance with the
letter and spirit of ERISA). The Adviser will act in a manner deemed prudent and
diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the assets of
its clients' accounts.

II.   PURPOSE

The purpose of these Policies and Procedures is to memorialize the procedures
and policies adopted by the Adviser to enable it to comply with its
responsibilities and the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"). These Policies and Procedures
also reflect the fiduciary standards and responsibilities set forth by the
Department of Labor for ERISA accounts.

III.  PROCEDURES

Cecilia Gondor, Executive Vice President of the Adviser, is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that all proxies received by the Adviser are voted in a
timely manner and voted consistently across all portfolios. Although many proxy
proposals can be voted in accordance with the Adviser's established guidelines
(see Section V. below) (the "Guidelines"), the Adviser recognizes that some
proposals require special consideration, which may dictate that the Adviser
makes an exception to the Guidelines.

Cecilia Gondor is also responsible for ensuring that all corporate actions
received by the Adviser are addressed in a timely manner and consistent action
is taken across all portfolios.

<PAGE>

      A. Conflicts of Interest. Where a proxy proposal raises a material
conflict of interest between the Adviser's interests and that of one or more its
clients, the Adviser shall resolve such conflict in the manner described below.

            1. Vote in Accordance with the Guidelines. To the extent that the
Adviser has little or no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect
to the proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such
pre-determined voting policy.

            2. Obtain Consent of Clients. To the extent that the Adviser has
discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the proposal in
question, the Adviser shall disclose the conflict to the relevant clients and
obtain their consent to the proposed vote prior to voting the securities. The
disclosure to the clients will include sufficient detail regarding the matter to
be voted on and the nature of our conflict that the clients would be able to
make an informed decision regarding the vote. When a client does not respond to
such a conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser will
abstain from voting the securities held by that client's account.

      B. Limitations. In certain circumstances, in accordance with a client's
investment advisory contract (or other written directive) or where the Adviser
has determined that it is in the client's best interest, the Adviser will not
vote proxies received. The following are some circumstances where the Adviser
will limit its role in voting proxies received on client securities:

            1. Client Maintains Proxy Voting Authority: Where a client has not
specifically delegated the authority to vote proxies to the Adviser or that it
has delegated the right to vote proxies to a third party, the Adviser will not
vote the securities and will direct the relevant custodian to send the proxy
material directly to the client. If any proxy material is received by the
Adviser, it will promptly be forwarded to the client.

            2. Terminated Account: Once a client account has been terminated
with the Adviser in accordance with its investment advisory agreement, the
Adviser will not vote any proxies received after the termination. However, the
client may specify in writing that proxies should be directed to the client for
action.

            3. Limited Value: If the Adviser concludes that the client's
economic interest or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or
insignificant, the Adviser will abstain from voting a client's proxies. The
Adviser does not vote proxies received for securities which are no longer held
by the client's account. In addition, the Adviser generally does not vote
securities where the economic value of the securities in the client's account is
less than $500.

            4. Securities Lending Programs: When securities are out on loan,
they are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in
its discretion. However, where the Adviser determines that a proxy vote (or
shareholder action) is materially important to the client's account, the Adviser
may recall the security.

            5. Unjustifiable Costs: In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, the Adviser may abstain from voting where the cost of
voting a client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits of the proxy
proposal.

IV.   RECORD KEEPING

In accordance with Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, the Adviser will maintain
for the time periods set forth in the Rule (i) these proxy voting procedures and
policies, and amendments thereto; (ii) all proxy statements received regarding
client securities (provided however, that the Adviser may rely on the proxy
statement filed on EDGAR as its records)(1); (iii) a record of votes cast on
behalf of clients; (iv) records of client requests for proxy voting information;
(v) any documents prepared by the adviser that were material to making a
decision how to vote or that memorialized the basis for the decision; and (vi)
records relating to requests made to clients regarding conflicts of interest in
voting the proxy.

<PAGE>

The Adviser will describe in its Part II of Form ADV (or other brochure
fulfilling the requirement of Rule 204-3) its proxy voting policies and
procedures and advising clients how they may obtain information on how the
Adviser voted their securities. Clients may obtain information on how their
securities were voted or a copy of our Policies and Procedures by written
request addressed to the Adviser.

V.    GUIDELINES

Each proxy issue will be considered individually. The following guidelines are a
partial list to be used in voting proposals contained in the proxy statements,
but will not be used as rigid rules.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)   Issues regarding the issuer's Board entrenchment and             Oppose
      anti-takeover measures such as the following:

      b.    Proposals to limit the ability of shareholders
            to call special meetings;

      c.    Proposals to require super majority votes;

      d.    Proposals requesting excessive increases in
            authorized common or preferred shares where
            management provides no explanation for the use
            or need for these additional shares;

      e.    Proposals regarding "poison pill" provisions;
            and

      f.    Permitting "green mail".
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)   Providing cumulative voting rights.                              Oppose
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)   "Social issues," unless specific client guidelines               Oppose
      supersede, e.g., restrictions regarding South Africa.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)   Election of directors recommended by management,                Approve
      except if there is a proxy fight.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)   Election of auditors recommended by management, unless          Approve
      seeking to replace if there exists a dispute over
      policies.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5)   Date and place of annual meeting.                               Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6)   Limitation on charitable contributions or fees paid to          Approve
      lawyers.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7)   Ratification of directors' actions on routine matters           Approve
      since previous annual meeting.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8)   Confidential voting Approve                                     Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ---------------
(1)   Because the Adviser primarily invests its clients' assets in securities of
      foreign issuers, the Adviser generally has not been receiving proxy
      statements from such issuers because the laws of the countries in which
      these issuers are domiciled respecting delivery of proxy statements to
      shareholders are different than those of the U.S.

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confidential voting is most often proposed by shareholders
as a means of eliminating undue management pressure on
shareholders regarding their vote on proxy issues.

The Adviser will generally approve these proposals as
shareholders can later divulge their votes to management on
a selective basis if a legitimate reason arises.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9)   Limiting directors' liability                                   Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(10)  Eliminate preemptive right                                      Approve

Preemptive rights give current shareholders the opportunity
to maintain their current percentage ownership through any
subsequent equity offerings. These provisions are no longer
common in the U.S., and can restrict management's ability to
raise new capital.

The Adviser approves the elimination of preemptive rights,
but will oppose the elimination of limited preemptive
rights, e.g., on proposed issues representing more than an
acceptable level of total dilution.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(11)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan                                    Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(12)  Establish 401(k) Plan                                           Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(13)  Rotate annual meeting location/date                             Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(14)  Establish a staggered Board Approve                             Approve
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(15)  Eliminate director mandatory retirement policy               Case-by-Case
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(16)  Option and stock grants to management and directors          Case-by-Case
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(17)  Allowing indemnification of directors and/or officers        Case-by-Case
      after reviewing the applicable laws and
      extent of protection requested.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.
          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

VI.   Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

            This code of ethics (the "Code") for the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a closed-end investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act"), applies to the Fund's
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the "Covered Officers" each
of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

            o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships;

            o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a registrant files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

            o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

            o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

            o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

            Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

VII.  Covered Officers Honest and Ethical Conduct and Ethically Handling Actual
      and Apparent Conflicts of Interest

            Overview. The Covered Officers shall conduct their activities on
behalf of the Fund in an honest and ethical manner. A "conflict of interest"
occurs when a Covered Officer's private interest interferes with the interests
of, or his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise
if a Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of his position with the Fund.

            Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and the investment adviser's
compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall
outside of the parameters of this Code.

            Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and the investment adviser, of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser and the Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers
in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund
and the adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it
is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors ("Board") that the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment
companies covered by this or other codes.

            Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

                                    * * * *

<PAGE>

            Each Covered Officer must not:

            o     use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

            o     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; and

            o     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
                  others to trade personally in contemplation of the market
                  effect of such transactions.

            There are some conflict of interest situations that should be
reviewed by the Fund's legal counsel, if material. Examples of these include:

            o     service as a director on the board of any public or private
                  company;

            o     receipt of gifts, in excess of reasonable or
                  business-appropriate;

            o     the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                  the Fund has current or prospective business dealings unless
                  such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

            o     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                  administrator or any affiliated person thereof; and

            o     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

VIII. Disclosure and Compliance

            o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
                  disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund.

            o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or
                  cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Board and independent auditor, and to government regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations.

            o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Fund and the adviser with the goal of
                  promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
                  disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with,
                  or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
                  by the Fund.

            o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IX.   Reporting and Accountability

            Each Covered Officer must:

            o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he has received, read, and understands the Code;

<PAGE>

            o     annually affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
                  requirements of the Code and report on the Covered Officer's
                  affiliations and relationships;

            o     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                  employee of the Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of
                  potential violations that are made in good faith; and

            o     notify the Fund's legal counsel promptly if he knows of any
                  violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
                  of the Code.

            The Fund's legal counsel is responsible for applying the Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by a Covered Officer will be considered by the
Independent Directors on the Board.

            The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
the Code:

            o     the Fund legal counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to such counsel;

            o     if, after such investigation, the Fund legal counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, such counsel is not required
                  to take any further action;

            o     any matter that the Fund legal counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the Board;

            o     the Board will consider appropriate action, which may include
                  review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable
                  policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
                  of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
                  dismiss the Covered Officer;

            o     the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as
                  appropriate; and

            o     any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

X.    Other Policies and Procedures

            The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are
superseded by the Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of the Code. The Fund's and its investment adviser's codes of ethics
under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and the adviser's more
detailed policies and procedures are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

XI.   Amendments

            Any amendments to the Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
independent trustees.

XII.  Confidentiality

            All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall
not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board, its legal counsel
and the adviser.

XIII. Internal Use

            The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
