Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.


May 14, 2004
                                                 INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME
                                                 FUND INC.
Dear Shareholder,
                                                 Investment Goal:
We present you with the annual report for        High level of current income
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the          exempt from federal
"Fund") for the fiscal year ended March 31,      income tax, consistent with
2004.                                            preservation of capital.

Performance
                                                 PORTFOLIO MANAGER:
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004,        William Veronda, UBS Global
Insured Municipal Income Fund's net              Asset Management (US) Inc.
asset value return was 4.68%. On a market
price basis, the Fund's return was 11.75%.       COMMENCEMENT:
During the same time period, the Fund's peer     June 8, 1993
group, as measured by the Lipper Insured
Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) median,         NYSE SYMBOL:
generated net asset value and market             PIF
price returns of 7.41% and 10.17%,
respectively. (For more performance              DIVIDEND PAYMENT:
information, please refer to "Performance At     Monthly
A Glance" on page 6).

The Fund used leverage during the fiscal period, which was 39.76% of total
assets as of March 31, 2004. Leverage can magnify returns on the upside and on
the downside, and can create wider dispersions of returns within the Fund's
peer group.



An Interview with Portfolio Manager William Veronda

Q. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A. During the reporting period, the US economy continued to gain momentum,
   fueled by the ongoing effects of significantly higher military spending, an
   increase in exports, and robust consumer and business spending. Gross
   domestic product (GDP) figures confirmed the economy's growth: in the
   second quarter of 2003, GDP came in at 3.3%, up from 1.4% for the prior
   quarter. A third quarter 2003 GDP of 8.2% followed; this number, far higher
   than anticipated, was the sharpest recorded advance of GDP since 1984.
   Although estimated fourth quarter GDP came in at a lower-than-expected
   4.1%, it was, nonetheless, viewed as a solid gain.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                             1

   While first quarter 2004 GDP figures have not yet been released, the
   economy appears to be moving forward at a strong pace. With the exception
   of the job market, which has been slow to recover, most areas of the
   economy are expanding, while overall inflation remains benign.

Q. HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THE ECONOMIC
   ENVIRONMENT?

A. The Fed held rates steady throughout the period, as it has since it lowered
   short-term interest rates to 1.00% on June 25, 2003. However, at its May 4,
   2004 meeting (held after period end), there was a clear shift in the Fed's
   stance, when, in its official statement, it noted, "accommodation can be
   removed at a pace that is likely to be measured." Many view this as an
   indication that the Fed could raise rates as early as its next meeting in
   June.

Q. HOW DID THE BOND MARKET PERFORM DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A. Given the strengthening economy, the overall bond market was surprisingly
   resilient during the reporting period. However, there were periods of
   unnerving volatility. Early in the period, yields fell and prices rose as
   investors were drawn to the relative safety offered by fixed income
   securities in response to economic uncertainty and geopolitical concerns.
   Then, beginning in June 2003, bond prices began to fall when a
   less-than-hoped-for cut in the fed funds rate, diminishing concerns
   regarding the potential for deflation, and fears that an improving economy
   would lead to a less accommodative fiscal policy, triggered a selloff. The
   market declined through July, before stabilizing and then recouping most of
   its losses in August and September.

   As 2004 began, a widely accepted expectation that the economy would
   continue to expand created a less than promising outlook for fixed income.
   However, despite the strong evidence that the economy was expanding,
   continued weakness in the labor market created a somewhat muddled picture.
   In February 2004, news that only 21,000 new jobs were created-significantly
   less than forecasted-gave rise to concerns that consumer confidence could
   weaken, and thus temper economic growth. Bonds rallied on the news.
   Additionally, periodic "flights to quality" given geopolitical events,
   including a terrorist attack in Spain and turmoil in the Middle East,
   bolstered the bond market. The municipal market participated in the broad
   fixed income rally, and was aided further by a strong demand for
   municipals.

Q. HOW DID YOU POSITION THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A. The Fund's duration was held generally in line with that of its benchmark,
   the Lehman Municipal Bond Index (the "Index"), during much of the period.
   However, in early 2004, we adjusted the Fund's duration, moving it slightly
   lower than the benchmark. We felt this cautious approach was warranted,
   given our belief that rates would rise. This detracted from relative
   results when yields fell and prices rose during the first quarter of 2004.

   With regard to sector positioning, we continued to emphasize essential
   service revenue bonds, including revenue-producing utilities such as water,
   sewers and select electric power facilities. We also held select airport
   revenue bonds; even though the airline industry itself is weak, the
   strengthening economy has increased the need for airfreight and
   transportation. Alternately, we underweighted the hospital sector, as we
   believe that declining government reimbursements will likely continue and
   lead to credit deterioration.

   As we mentioned in our last report to shareholders, we had increased the
   Fund's exposure to investment grade securities whose ratings are among the
   very highest-that is, those that have achieved AAA status on their own
   merits, without the benefit of insurance. This strategy proved beneficial,
   as it helped us increase the Fund's level of diversification, while giving
   us the opportunity to invest in a number of compelling opportunities.

Q. CAN YOU PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF HOLDINGS THAT WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO DURING
   THE PERIOD?

A. Late in the fiscal year, we began adding some California revenue credits
   that are not directly associated with the economic troubles in the state.
   Examples of specific holdings included Los Angeles Water & Power and Los
   Angeles County Sanitation District. We are also closely monitoring
   California's fiscal condition, and are encouraged by the progress that has
   been made on several fronts. If this trend continues, we expect to
   selectively increase the Fund's exposure to the state's municipal
   securities.

Q. WERE THERE ANY FACTORS THAT DETRACTED FROM RESULTS DURING THE PERIOD?

A. As mentioned previously, during the fiscal year, the Fund's duration was
   shorter than that of its benchmark, because we did not believe it was
   prudent to extend duration given the economic expansion and the potential
   for rising interest rates and falling bond prices. However, this hurt
   relative results as yields declined and bond prices rose over the fiscal
   year.

                                                                             3

   Additionally, a number of bonds in the Fund's portfolio were "called" or
   prematurely retired by issuers looking to take advantage of the low
   interest rate environment-one example was Matagorda County Navigation
   District No. 1 Revenue-Houston Light & Power, which was scheduled to mature
   in March 2027 and offered a yield of 6.70%. Given today's lower rates, it
   was not possible to replace these holdings with securities that offered
   comparable yields.

Q: WERE THERE ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE DURING THE
   PERIOD?

A: In December 2003, the Fund generated a significant amount of new investor
   assets that were then redeployed using the same positioning strategies
   previously mentioned. Toward the end of 2003, we increased the Fund's
   leverage from approximately 33% to 40%. While this could result in an
   increase in the Fund's short-term volatility, we believe that over the
   longer-term this strategy is consistent with our goal of preservation of
   capital. It will also help us to moderately extend the Fund's duration. In
   addition, we believe this increased leveraging will allow the Fund to
   generate incremental dividend income.

Q. HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE POSITIONING THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?

A. Looking ahead, it is our belief that the US economy will continue to
   expand. Given that interest rates are so low, we believe it is inevitable
   that they will rise (and the Fed has indicated as much). Based on this
   outlook, we expect to keep the Fund's duration neutral or slightly lower
   than that of the Index. In terms of the Fund's portfolio, we are
   comfortable with its current positioning. Should the economy continue to
   expand, it will likely serve to improve the fiscal situations in a number
   of states. If this occurs, we will look to identify select general
   obligation bonds that we believe offer compelling opportunities.

Past performance does not predict future performance. The return and principal
value of an investment will fluctuate, so that an investor's shares, when sold,
may be worth more or less than their original cost. NAV return assumes, for
illustration only, that dividends were reinvested at the net asset value on the
ex-dividend dates. Market price return assumes dividends were reinvested under
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. NAV and market price returns for periods of
less than one year are cumulative.

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements


ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment
objective is to achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from
federal income tax, consistent with the preservation of capital.

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations that provide general indemnification. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Fund's
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use reported last
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). The amortized cost method of valuation, which
approximates market value, generally is used to value short-term debt
instruments with sixty days or less remaining to maturity, unless the Board
determines that this does not represent fair value. Securities traded in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") market are valued at the last bid price available on
the valuation date prior to valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income
is recorded on


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.


Notes to Financial Statements

an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as
adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

DERIVATIVES--The Fund may use options (both exchange traded and OTC) to attempt
to enhance income (which would be taxable income) and also may attempt to
"hedge" or manage the overall risk of its investments by using options, futures
contracts and interest rate protection transactions. The Fund may use
derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in an underlying security or
other asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other
risks, such as interest rate risk. The Fund also may use derivatives to add
leverage to the portfolio and/or to hedge against increases in the Fund's costs
associated with the dividend payments on preferred stock and auction preferred
stock of the Fund.

Derivatives are subject to a number of risks, including liquidity risk,
interest rate risk, credit risk and leverage risk. They also involve the risk
of improper valuation and imperfect correlations with the underlying asset rate
index.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders at a level rate that over time will result in the distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of
dividends on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend rate on the
common stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund.
Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued
daily. The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions
from net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income
tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. These "book/tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of,
municipal obligations held by the Fund.


INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM"), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator
of


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                           21

the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management subsidiary
of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization with headquarters in
Zurich, Switzerland and operations in many areas of the financial services
industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract, the Fund pays UBS Global AM
an investment advisory and administration fee, which is accrued weekly and paid
monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's average weekly net assets.
UBS Global AM has agreed to waive 0.20% of the advisory and administration fee,
so that the Fund's effective fee is 0.70% of average weekly net assets. The
waiver will continue indefinitely unless the Board agrees to a change. At March
31, 2004, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $315,978 representing $405,741 for
investment advisory and administration fees less fee waivers of $89,763. For
the year ended March 31, 2004, UBS Global AM waived $867,058 in investment
advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A, 800 shares
of Auction Preferred Shares Series B, 800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares
Series C, 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D, 600 shares of
Auction Preferred Shares Series E and 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares
Series F which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." (Auction
Preferred Shares Series E and Auction Preferred Shares Series F were issued on
December 22, 2003). All shares of each series of APS have liquidation
preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid
dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for all APS
Series. Dividend rates ranged from 0.65% to 2.25% for the year ended March 31,
2004.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

For federal income tax purposes, at March 31, 2004, the components of net
unrealized appreciation of investments were as follows:

For the year ended March 31, 2004, total aggregate purchases and sales of
portfolio securities, excluding short-term securities, were $277,065,701 and
$166,703,900, respectively.

The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income,
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal
excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2004 and March 31, 2003 were as follows:

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") is a diversified, closed-end
management investment company whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE").The Fund's investment objective is to achieve a high level of current
income that is exempt from federal income tax, consistent with the preservation
of capital. The Fund's investment advisor and administrator is UBS Global Asset
Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global AM"), an indirect wholly owned asset
management subsidiary of UBS AG, which had approximately $53.1 billion in
assets under management as of April 30, 2004.

INVESTMENT POLICY CHANGE

In July 2003, the Fund's Board approved a change in investment policy. The Fund
may now invest in securities whose maturities are less than 10 years at the
time of purchase. Prior to this change, the Fund had a policy of investing
substantially all of its assets in municipal obligations having maturities in
excess of 10 years at the time of purchase.

You may obtain a description of the Fund's proxy voting policies and
procedures, without charge, upon request by contacting the Fund directly at

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "PIF." Comparative net asset value and market
price information about the Fund is published weekly in The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times and Barron's, as well as in numerous other
publications.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own
names, or in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have
all dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock
automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such
common shareholders elect to receive cash.Common shareholders who elect to hold
their shares in the name of another broker or nominee should contact such
broker or nominee to determine whether, or how, they may participate in the
Plan.The ability of such shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if
their shares are transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONCLUDED)

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time. Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should include the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the
share certificate or in the transfer agent's records. An election to terminate
participation in the Plan, until such election is changed, will be deemed an
election by a common shareholder to take all subsequent distributions in cash.
An election will be effective only for distributions declared and having a
record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is received.

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or
lower than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend
will be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend
payable to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including
applicable brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in
the open market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in
connection with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for
reinvesting dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for
handling the reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However,
each participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in
connection with the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment
of dividends and other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with respect to any
dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution. The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan
should be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027,
Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information regarding the
Plan, you may also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331-1710.

                                                             ----          ----

                                                             2004*        2003*
                                                             -----        -----

              * Includes amounts related to non-audit services prior to May 6,
              2003 that would have been subject to pre-approval if the SEC rules

                                                             -----        -----
              Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.            $8,300      $10,590

              * Includes amounts related to non-audit services prior to May 6,
              2003 that would have been subject to pre-approval if the SEC rules

              effect at that time.

              Fees included in the tax fees category comprise all services
              performed by professional staff in the independent accountant's

                                                           ----           ----
              Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.            $0             $0

              Fees included in the all other fees category would consist of

              The registrant's Audit and Contract Review Committee ("audit
              committee") has adopted an "Audit and Contract Review Committee
              Charter (Amended and Restated as of February 11, 2004)" (the
              "charter"). The charter contains the audit committee's
              pre-
<PAGE>

              approval policies and procedures. Reproduced below is an excerpt
              from the charter regarding pre-approval policies and procedures:

                   The [audit ]Committee shall:

                           ...

              2.   Pre-approve (a) all audit and permissible non-audit
                   services(2) to be provided to the Fund and (b) all
                   permissible non-audit services to be provided by the Fund's
                   independent auditors to UBS Global [Asset Management (US)
                   Inc. ("UBS Global")] and any Covered Service Providers, if
                   the engagement relates directly to the operations and
                   financial reporting of the Fund. In carrying out this
                   responsibility, the Committee shall seek periodically from
                   UBS Global and from the independent auditors a list of such
                   audit and permissible non-audit services that can be expected
                   to be rendered to the Fund, UBS Global or any Covered Service
                   Providers by the Fund's independent auditors, and an estimate
                   of the fees sought to be paid in connection with such
                   services. The Committee may delegate its responsibility to
                   pre-approve any such audit and permissible non-audit services
                   to a sub-committee consisting of the Chairperson of the
                   Committee and two other members of the Committee as the
                   Chairperson, from time to time, may determine and appoint,
                   and such sub-committee shall report to the Committee, at its
                   next regularly scheduled meeting after the sub-committee's
                   meeting, its decision(s). From year to year, the Committee
                   shall report to the Board whether this system of pre-approval
                   has been effective and efficient or whether this Charter
                   should be amended to allow for pre-approval pursuant to such
                   policies and procedures as the Committee shall approve,
                   including the delegation of some or all of the Committee's
                   pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other than
                   UBS Global or the Fund's officers).

                   ---------------
                   (2)  The Committee will not approve non-audit services that
                        the Committee believes may taint the independence of the
                        auditors. Currently, permissible non-audit services
                        include any professional services (including tax
                        services) that are not prohibited services as described
                        below, provided to the Fund by the independent auditors,
                        other than those provided to the Fund in connection with
                        an audit or a review of the financial statements of the
                        Fund. Permissible non-audit services may not include:
                        (i) bookkeeping or other services related to the
                        accounting records or financial statements of the Fund;
                        (ii) financial information systems design and
                        implementation; (iii) appraisal or valuation services,
                        fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; (iv)
                        actuarial services; (v) internal audit outsourcing
                        services; (vi) management functions or human resources;
                        (vii) broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment
                        banking services; (viii) legal services and expert
                        services unrelated to the audit; and (ix) any other
                        service the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
                        determines, by regulation, is impermissible.

                        Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible
                        non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the
                        aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit
                        services
<PAGE>

                        provided to the Fund, UBS Global and any service
                        providers controlling, controlled by or under common
                        control with UBS Global that provide ongoing services to
                        the Fund ("Covered Service Providers") constitutes not
                        more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid to the
                        independent auditors (during the fiscal year in which
                        the permissible non-audit services are provided) by (a)
                        the Fund, (b) its investment adviser and (c) any entity
                        controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
                        the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to
                        the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services
                        are provided that would have to be approved by the
                        Committee; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were
                        not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement
                        to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are
                        promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and
                        approved by the Committee (or its delegate(s)) prior to
                        the completion of the audit.

     (e)  (2) Services approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
              of Regulation S-X:

              Audit-Related Fees:

              There were no amounts that were approved by the audit committee
              pursuant to the de minimis exception for the fiscal years ended
              March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 on behalf of the registrant.
              This includes amounts related to non-audit services prior to May
              6, 2003 that would have been subject to pre-approval if the SEC
              rules relating to the pre-approval of non-audit services had been

              There were no amounts that were required to be approved by the
              audit committee pursuant to the de minimis exception for the
              fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 on behalf of
              the registrant's service providers that relate directly to the
              operations and financial reporting of the registrant. This

ITEM 6.  [RESERVED BY SEC FOR FUTURE USE. ]


ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant's Board of Directors believes that the voting of proxies on
securities held by the registrant is an important element of the overall
investment process. As such, the Board has delegated the responsibility to vote
such proxies to the registrant's advisor. Following is a summary of the proxy
voting policy of the advisor.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY, VOTING GUIDELINES AND POLICY SUMMARY

The proxy voting policy of UBS Global AM is based on its belief that voting
rights have economic value and must be treated accordingly. Generally, UBS
Global AM expects the boards of directors of companies issuing securities held
by its clients to act as stewards of the financial assets of the company, to
exercise good judgment and practice diligent oversight with the management of
the company. While there is no absolute set of rules that determine appropriate
corporate governance under all circumstances and no set of rules will guarantee
ethical behavior, there are certain benchmarks, which, if substantial progress
is made toward, give evidence of good corporate governance. UBS Global AM may
delegate to an independent proxy voting and research service the authority to
exercise the voting rights associated with certain client holdings. Any such
delegation shall be made with the direction that the votes be exercised in
accordance with UBS Global AM's proxy voting policy.

When UBS Global AM's view of a company's management is favorable, UBS Global AM
generally supports current management initiatives. When UBS Global AM's view is
that changes to the management structure would probably increase shareholder
value, UBS Global AM may not support existing management proposals. In general,
UBS Global AM (1) opposes proposals which act to entrench management; (2)
believes that boards should be independent of company management and composed of
persons with requisite skills, knowledge and experience; (3) opposes structures
which impose financial constraints on changes in control; (4) believes
remuneration should be commensurate with responsibilities and performance; and
(5) believes that appropriate steps should be taken to ensure the independence
of auditors.

UBS Global AM has implemented procedures designed to identify whether it has a
conflict of interests in voting a particular proxy proposal, which may arise as
a result of its or its affiliates' client relationships, marketing efforts or
banking, investment banking and broker/dealer activities. To address such
conflicts, UBS Global AM has imposed information barriers between it and its
affiliates who conduct banking, investment banking and broker/dealer activities
and has implemented procedures to prevent business, sales and marketing issues
from influencing our proxy votes. Whenever UBS Global AM is aware of a conflict
with respect to a particular proxy, its appropriate local corporate governance
committee is required to review and agree to the manner in which such proxy is
voted.


ITEM 8.  PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
         COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Form N-CSR disclosure requirement not yet effective with respect to the
registrant.

<PAGE>

ITEM 9.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

The registrant's Board has established a Nominating Committee. The Nominating
Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders if a vacancy occurs
among those board members who are not "interested persons" as defined in Section
2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In order to
recommend a nominee, a shareholder should send a letter to the chairperson of
the Nominating Committee, Mr. Meyer Feldberg, care of the Secretary of the
registrant at UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc., 51 West 52nd Street, New
York, New York 10019-6114, and indicate on the envelope "Nominating Committee."
The shareholder's letter should state the nominee's name and should include the
nominee's resume or curriculum vitae, and must be accompanied by a written
consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated for the Board and
to serve if elected by shareholders.

ITEM 10.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

    (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
         officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and
         procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company
         Act of 1940, as amended) are effective based on their evaluation of
         these controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing
         date of this document.

    (b)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
         officer are aware of no changes in the registrant's internal control
         over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
         recent fiscal half-year that has materially affected, or is reasonably
         likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
         financial reporting.


ITEM 11.  EXHIBITS.

    (a)  (1) Code of Ethics as required pursuant to Section 406 of the
         Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (and designated by registrant as a "Code of

CODE OF CONDUCT




<PAGE>



INTRODUCTION
This Code of Conduct ("Code") applies to U.S. registered investment companies
("Funds") for which UBS Global Asset Management ("UBS Global AM") acts as
advisor, sub-advisor and/or manager where UBS Global AM employees serve as
officers of the Funds. This Code shall serve as the code of ethics required by
Section 406 of the Sabanes-Oxley Act.

This Code applies to a Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing
similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the
registrant or a third party.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS
Each person to whom this Code applies (a "Covered Person") must respect, and
comply with, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to a Fund.

It is the personal responsibility of each Covered Person to adhere to the
standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations.

INTEGRITY AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Each Covered Person must act ethically, with honesty and integrity, including
the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
personal and professional relationships. A conflict of interest exists when a
person's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in any way with
the interests of a Fund.

Any Covered Person who becomes aware of a conflict of interest or potential
conflict of interest not addressed by existing policies or procedures (e.g.,
Rule 17e-1 Procedures) must promptly consult the Compliance Procedure described
in this Code.

FAIR DEALING
A Covered Person must not take unfair advantage of a Fund through manipulation,
concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material
facts, or any other unfair practice.

A Covered Person must respect and promote compliance with applicable insider
trading laws, rules and regulations as well as with the internal directives and
policies of UBS Global AM concerning illegal or unethical trading while in
possession of material non-public information.

FUND OPPORTUNITIES
A Covered Person must abstain from taking for himself or herself personally, or
directing to third parties, opportunities that are discovered through the use of
Fund property, information or position, or otherwise competing with the
interests of a Fund, unless a Fund has already been offered the opportunity and
turned it down or such actions are otherwise consistent with the policies and
practices disclosed in the Fund's disclosure documents or approved by the Fund's
board or otherwise permissible under securities laws and regulations (e.g., soft
dollars, trade allocation policies).

PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF FUND ASSETS
A Covered Person must endeavor to protect a Fund's assets.

Fund property should not be used for personal use.
<PAGE>

DISCLOSURE IN REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS
A Covered Person must see that a Fund discloses information fully, fairly,
accurately, timely and understandably in reports and documents that a Fund files
with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by a Fund.

REPORTING ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE
A Covered Person must promptly consult the Compliance Procedure described in
this Code about any observed violations of this Code, including any violations
of laws, rules, regulations or other legal requirements or when in doubt about
the best course of action in a particular situation.

It is the policy of UBS Global AM not to allow retaliation for reports of
misconduct by others made in good faith.

Reports may be made anonymously if the situation requires that identity be kept
secret. UBS Global AM has established an ethics hotline that permits the
anonymous reporting of ethical violations.

WAIVERS OF THIS CODE
Any waiver of this Code may be made only by the Board of the relevant Fund or
the General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of UBS Global AM and will be
disclosed as required by applicable law or regulations. Any waiver by the
General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of UBS Global AM must be reported to
the Board of the relevant Fund no later than their next regularly scheduled
meeting.

For purposes of this provision, the term "waiver" means the approval of a
material departure from a provision in this Code. It also includes an "implicit
waiver," which means the failure to take action within a reasonable period of
time regarding a material departure from a provision of the Code that has been
made known to an executive officer of a fund or the General Counsel or a Deputy
General Counsel of UBS Global AM.

Any person granting a waiver is responsible for promptly alerting the persons
responsible for preparing SEC filings so that required disclosure regarding a
waiver may be timely included in filings (e.g., Form N-CSR filings).

COMPLIANCE PROCEDURE
If you are unsure about how to handle a situation with regard to this Code or
are aware of any violations or apparent violations of this Code promptly contact
the General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of UBS Global AM.

A Fund's Board, the General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of UBS Global AM
has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THIS CODE
Those who violate the standards in this Code will be subject to disciplinary
proceedings or dismissal by UBS Global AM.

A copy of this Code shall be provided to each Covered Person.

NOTE REGARDING INTERPLAY WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS
This Code deals with the required standards of fairness, honesty and integrity
in a universal and general manner. UBS Global AM and its affiliates have issued,
and will issue from time to time, more specific directives, policies, principals
and procedures to implement such values
<PAGE>

while reflecting the specific requirements of a business group, business area or
a particular jurisdiction. If there is any inconsistency between the
requirements of this Code or any other applicable policy, the higher standard
shall apply.

This Code is supplemental to, and does not replace, any other code applicable to
Covered Persons, such as a code of ethics regarding personal investing or
restrictions on the receipt of gifts from third-party vendors or service
contractors.

                                                                  [4/03 Version]

                    annual report) that has materially affected, or is

                    report financial information; and
