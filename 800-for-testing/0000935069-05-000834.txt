                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                      For the year ended January 31, 2005
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2005, the Fund had a total return of 2.98%.1 For
the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2005, the Fund had an average annual total return of 8.35%.

While the Fund's performance for the year was disappointing, it was not
especially surprising given how the year evolved and how the portfolio was
positioned. In 2003, the Fund performed very well due in large part to exposure
to distressed investment strategies. Beginning in 2004, we began to pare risk in
the portfolio by layering in positions designed to serve as insurance against
potential mean-reversions in credit spreads and volatility, both of which we
felt had been stretched to abnormally low levels. As a result of these moves, as
well as risk-reduction trades performed by our multi-strategy managers, the Fund
was significantly less exposed to credit factors during 2004 relative to 2003.
Since neither volatility nor credit did mean-revert in 2004, the Fund's
performance was muted by these positions.

The resurgence in corporate activity during 2004 featured a fairly steady flow
of leveraged buyout activity, interspersed by some large strategic acquisitions,
particularly at the end of the year. Despite the increased transaction flow
during 2004, however, overall merger volume has not yet approached the levels of
1998-2000. In the meantime, the amount of capital managed by multi-strategy
event managers has probably doubled, commoditizing merger arbitrage to some
extent. The majority of merger arbitrage situations no longer offer favorable
spreads or returns compensating investors for the larger losses incurred if the
deal breaks. The Fund is invested with a group of managers who are
well-positioned to capitalize on any resurgence of opportunities in merger
arbitrage, but who have reoriented their investment processes and portfolios to
the point that they are not dependent on the strategy in order to earn
attractive risk-adjusted rates of return.

                           Fund Commentary (continued)
                       For the year ended January 31, 2005
                                   (Unaudited)

In other areas of their portfolios, these managers are gradually selling down
their distressed investment holdings, building out sector-focused long/short
equity exposure, and exploring limited opportunities in convertible arbitrage,
private equity and real estate.

In fixed income arbitrage, the phenomenon of investors reaching for yield has
reverberated through various areas of the fixed income and credit derivative
markets, creating opportunities for our managers. Market participants who reach
for higher yields by taking on negative-convexity and short-volatility positions
achieve a positive carry, but require that market conditions remain calm to be
profitable. As long as rates and volatility normalize the payout from taking the
other side of these trades, as our managers do, they should provide substantial
upside potential. At the same time, the growth and increasing complexity and
liquidity of segments of the credit markets, such as asset-backed securities,
bank loans and credit default swaps, expands the potential set of anomalies that
our managers like to exploit.

The environment in convertible arbitrage during 2004 echoed that of 2003.
Depressed levels of equity volatility made gamma trading unprofitable, but
tightening credit spreads drove modest returns in credit-sensitive issues. The
composition of the convertible universe and corresponding convertible managers'
portfolios is such that the effect of the trends roughly offset each other,
resulting in slightly positive performance for the year for managers exposed to
both factors. The Financial Accounting Standards Board-mandated change in the
accounting treatment for contingent convertible securities ("CoCos") also
affected returns, though modestly. Overall, the unfavorable supply/demand
characteristics, low volatility, and tight credit spreads make the prospects for
convertible arbitrage unexciting in the near term. We remain underweight in this
category awaiting a more favorable investment environment.

            Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC

                              Fund Commentary
                     For the year ended January 31, 2005
                                (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want to or be able to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must estimate the value of the claims he is buying, the
likely timing and resolution of the bankruptcy process and also may be called
upon to reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2005, the Fund had a total return of 10.24%.1 For
the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2005, the Fund had an average annual total return of 15.35%.

At the end of last year, we noted the historically tight levels of credit
spreads in the context of their closely linked relationship with returns over
time, and anticipated that the performance of distressed investment strategies
would be much more modest in 2004 as the portfolios of the Fund's managers
matured and the opportunity set for attractive new investments thinned out.
Despite this being the case, over the course of the past year the high yield and
distressed markets still posted solid gains as liquidity and demand for yield
overwhelmed any indications of a riskier environment for credit investing. The
reach for yield continued to invigorate the new issue market, which enjoyed a
second straight year of historically high activity and allowed many struggling
companies to refinance onerous high-coupon debt. Low levels of interest rates
translated into relatively reasonable leverage and interest coverage ratios on
the new issuance. However, the percentage of new issue volume rated CCC and
below more than doubled to 7% in 2004. Furthermore, amidst some very
constructive transactions, the frothy conditions also enabled some notable
instances of speculative activity, including high yield issuances that put
significant leverage on recent buyout deals in order to dividend back to equity
holders the majority of their investment. Our expectation is that some of these
higher risk situations might create opportunities for our distressed managers in
the medium term, as evidenced by the historical relationship between high yield
and default rates. Generally, we expect more muted return prospects for this
area of the portfolio until spreads are pushed out, either by the gradual
passage of time or some sort of dislocating event (or events) that will create
conditions that cause a repricing of credit risk and create attractive entry
points for new investment.

                Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC

                               Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2005
                                  (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed mostly of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2005, the Fund had a total return of 3.90%.1 For
the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2005, the Fund had an average annual total return of 6.34%.

Equity markets were particularly tranquil as the genuine economic recovery that
began in 2003 firmly took hold in 2004. The S&P 500 rose 4.44% for the one-year
period ending January 31, 2005, driven primarily by robust November and December
gains. The high liquidity, low volatility environment of the past year muted the
performance of most of our long/short managers. Well-diversified, well-hedged
portfolios simply did not have enough embedded risk to provide substantial alpha
in these market conditions, especially during the year-end rally. Consequently,
the top performing managers of 2004 typically ran either relatively concentrated
or relatively unhedged portfolios.

We believe this lower return environment for long/short managers is not so much
a function of inflows into the strategy as it is a function of the business
cycle. Volatility and dispersion are mean-reverting, and typically are depressed
during periods of steady economic growth and ample liquidity. Eventually,
something will upset this balance, as always happens, and we are positioning the
portfolio to attempt to prosper until that point and beyond.

                Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC

                               Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2005
                                 (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
capital among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market
neutral strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund contains managers that attempt to create long and short portfolios that
are roughly equal in size and therefore immune to overall stock markets
movements. Often these strategies are quantitative in nature, using computer
screens to pick long and short portfolios of stocks and balancing their risk
exposure through optimization techniques.

For the year ended January 31, 2005, the Fund had a total return of 1.84%.1 For
the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2005, the Fund had an average annual total return of 1.94%.

The low volatility and dispersion of equity returns made the year especially
difficult for market neutral managers, who cannot supplant return variance with
selective beta exposure to generate performance. Mid-year, we attempted to boost
performance by shifting assets into funds with higher concentrations and were
rewarded for doing so. We continue to believe that concentration is an asset for
market neutral managers, as high levels of liquidity will continue to hold down
measures of volatility and return dispersion. Our best performance this year
came from asset allocation strategies, which took advantage of strong trends in
the currency market and the relative outperformance of international and
emerging equities. The greatest source of weakness in the Fund this year came
from yield curve strategies. While disappointing, we do not view this
development with alarm as the Treasury markets defied expectations throughout
the year. We are continuing to reposition the Market Neutral Fund in an effort
to improve its performance profile. Given its primary objective as a volatility
dampener in a portfolio context, we are pleased with its results and expect it
to hold value relatively well in the event of market dislocation.

To the Board of Managers and Members of:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos
Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC and Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC (hereafter referred to as the
"Funds") at January 31, 2005, the results of each of their operations and their
cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in each of their members'
capital for the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights
for the years ended January 31, 2005, and January 31, 2004, and the period
August 21, 2002 (commencement of operations) through January 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds' management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of investments with the portfolio funds at
January 31, 2005, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC
and Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, valued at $239,179,701
(97.2% of the Fund's net assets), $42,892,277 (94.8% of the Fund's net assets),
$316,129,396 (97.2% of Fund's net assets) and $76,514,302 (93.1% of the Fund's
net assets), respectively, at January 31, 2005, the values of which have been
estimated by the Investment Manager, under the general supervision of the Board
of Managers, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values. Those
estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been
used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the difference could be
material.

benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by Members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

C. Fund Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.


                                                                              19

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to be treated as a partnership for Federal income tax
purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating
to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no
provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

E. Distribution Policy

Each Fund has no present intention of making periodic distributions of its net
investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and frequency
of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of the
Board.

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.
The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.50% of each Fund's average monthly net assets, through
December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, the Investment Manager has
contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to limit the Funds' other
expenses at 0.25% of each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May
31, 2006.


                                                                              20

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of up to 0.12%, subject to certain fee
minimums, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain out-of-pocket
expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian, a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual fee of $20,000. Any Manager who is an
"interested person" does not receive any annual or other fee from the Funds. All
Managers are reimbursed by the Funds for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interest in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.





                                                                              21


<PAGE>


                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques, including
leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a
high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to
achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio
Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The
Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

7. INVESTMENTS

As of January 31, 2005, the Funds had investments in thirty-three Portfolio
Funds, none of which were related parties. The following table lists the Funds'
investments in Portfolio Funds as of January 31, 2005. The agreements related to
investments in Portfolio Funds provide for compensation to the general
partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.0% to 2.0% (per annum) of
the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net profits
earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with lock-up
provisions ranging from 3 months to 2 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after the lock-up provisions.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                       AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This policy sets forth Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("AAM")
         policies and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio
         securities held in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary
         investment management services and for which AAM has the explicit
         authority to vote their proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if
         necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting
         issues as they arise.

         As an investment manager for various clients, including clients
         governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended ("ERISA"), AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to
         manage, acquire and dispose of client account assets, unless the "named
         fiduciary" for an ERISA account has explicitly reserved the authority
         for itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the
         client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will
         vote proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make
         voting decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its


<PAGE>

         ERISA plan clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all
         relevant factors and without undue influence from individuals or groups
         who may have an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy vote. In
         fulfilling its obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a manner it
         deems prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the
         economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held in its
         clients' accounts.

II.      ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

         AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
         on matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided
         that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract
         from the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
         accounts. These matters are set out below:

         (i)     Appointment or election of auditors;
         (ii)    Routine elections or re-elections of directors;
         (iii)   Director's liability and indemnification;
         (iv)    General updating/corrective amendments to charter;
         (v)     Name changes;
         (vi)    Elimination of cumulative voting; and
         (vii)   Elimination of preemptive rights.

III.     ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

         A.      AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of
                 management initiatives which may have a substantive financial
                 or best interest impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion,
                 approval of such initiatives will not detract from the economic
                 value of the company's securities held in AAM client accounts.
                 These matters are set out below:

                 (i)      Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes
                          of stock and voting rights;
                 (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization for stock
                          splits, stock dividends, and other specified needs
                          which are no more than 50% of the existing
                          authorization;
                 (iii)    Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not
                          less than 85% of fair market value;
                 (iv)     Stock option plans that are incentive based and not
                          excessive;
                 (v)      Other stock-based plans which are appropriately
                          structured;
                 (vi)     Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and
                 (vii)    Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

         B.      AAM will generally not vote in support of management on certain
                 issues which have a potential substantive financial or best
                 interest impact when AAM believes that approval of the
                 proposal may negatively impact the economic value of the
                 company's securities held in AAM client accounts. These matters
                 are set out below:

                 (i)      Capitalization changes which add classes of stock
                          which are blank check in nature or that dilute the
                          voting interests of existing shareholders;
                 (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization where
                          management does not offer an appropriate rationale or
                          that are contrary to the best interest of existing
                          shareholders;
                 (iii)    Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to
                          prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                          their rights or effectively deter appropriate tender
                          offers and other offers;
                 (iv)     Amendments to by-laws which would require
                          supermajority shareholder votes to pass or repeal
                          certain provisions;
                 (v)      Classified boards of directors;
                 (vi)     Reincorporation into a state which  has more stringent
                          anti-takeover and related provisions;
                 (vii)    Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate
                          offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                          trigger provisions which prevent legitimate offers
                          from proceeding;
                 (viii)   Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation
                          related proposals;


<PAGE>

                 (ix)     Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                          compensation plans, employment contracts and severance
                          agreements that benefit management and would be costly
                          to shareholders if triggered; and
                 (x)      "Other business as properly comes before the meeting"
                          proposals which give a blank check to those acting as
                          proxy.

IV.      SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

         AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
         matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such
         matters, usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party
         analyses of these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in
         our view negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will
         oppose it.

V.       CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

         Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
         interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
         conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy
         of disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
         before voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting
         guidelines if the application of the guidelines to the matter do not
         involve the exercise of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using the
         recommendations of an independent third party.

VI.      PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

         AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
         procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf
         of clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting
         information; and (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM that
         were material in making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the
         above-mentioned records for a minimum of five years.

VII.     PROXY ADMINISTRATION

         AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
         positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and
         oversees the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief
         Investment Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel,
         analyzes types of proposals based on whether they would adversely
         affect shareholder's interests and make a company less attractive to
         own. In evaluating proxy proposals each year, the Committee relies upon
         our own knowledge of each company and its management, independent
         research provided by third parties, and information presented by
         company managements and shareholder groups.

         Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are
         distributed to AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines.
         Ultimately, the investment professional primarily accountable for a
         portfolio is responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio. Most
         vote consistent with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will take an
         independent view on certain issues and vote differently. When an
         investment professional casts votes which are counter to the
         Committee's guidelines, they are required to document their reasons in
         writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of Managers of the AAM
         Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies, and voting
         records.

<TEXT>


                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR COVERED OFFICERS OF
         INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing integrity of financial reporting and transactions. The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.       SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of
Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Insofar as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies and procedures that govern the conduct of all of Aetos' employees,
including the Covered Officers, such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles, policies and procedures conflict with
the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this Code. In addition to this Code or any other code of ethics
previously adopted by Aetos, the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") and rules promulgated thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching. Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment Company Act or Advisers Act provisions or the rules thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.      REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

      1.    Engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct, including
            the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of
            interest between personal and professional relationships;

      2.    Act responsibly in producing and produce, full, fair,
            accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and
            documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other
            public communications made by the Funds;

      3.    Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and
            regulations;

      4.    Promptly report suspected material violations of this Code,
            including violations of securities laws or other laws, rules
            and regulations applicable to the Funds, to Aetos' General
            Counsel and the Audit Committee; and

      5.    Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity, including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos' policies, and place the interests of the Funds before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.


<PAGE>


Each Covered Officer is required to familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others, including, but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds, and their respective independent managers, independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
employees of the Funds and Aetos with the goal of promoting full, fair,
accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made
by the Funds.

It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III.     AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The overarching principle of this Code is that the personal interests of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict of interest in an ethical manner; (ii) not use his or her personal
influence or personal relationships to influence investment decisions or
financial reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund; (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of such Fund; and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.      COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow certain procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) all violations and
potential violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General Counsel of Aetos will take all appropriate action to investigate any
