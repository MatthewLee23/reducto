Dear Fellow Shareholders,

The stock market has made a strong recovery in 2003.  Historically  low interest
rates,  improving  corporate earnings and government stimulus in the form of tax
cuts gave investors  hope that the economy would begin to  strengthen,  which it
did.  The  markets  move up began in April  and the  breadth  of the  rally  was
enormous.  As  a  result,  the  major  indexes  were  able  to  wipe  out  their
first-quarter  losses and post solid gains year-to-date through October 31. With
technology  leading the way, the tech-heavy  Nasdaq  Composite Index rose 45.22%
through October,  while the Dow Jones  Industrial  Average was up 19.82% and the
Standard & Poors 500 Index returned 21.19%.  With falling interest rates,  bonds
also did well,  although they began to reverse course in July.  High yield bonds
led the pack,  returning  24.23%  through  October,  as  measured  by the Lehman
Brothers High Yield Index.

In other news,  we are pleased to inform you that on  September  28,  2003,  the
Boards  of  Directors  of  Canada-based   Manulife  Financial   Corporation  and
Boston-based John Hancock Financial  Services,  Inc., the parent company of John
Hancock Funds, unanimously voted to merge the two companies.

Please be assured that the  completion of the merger -  anticipated  to occur in
the first  half of 2004 - will have no  effect  on your  investment  in our John
Hancock  mutual funds.  Your funds adviser and board of trustees will remain the
same, as will your relationship with your financial adviser.

The merger is subject to  customary  closing  conditions,  including  receipt of
required regulatory approvals and approval by John Hancock stockholders.  If you
only own shares in a John Hancock  mutual fund you are not affected and will not
receive a proxy.

Additional  information  on this  transaction  is  available  on our  Web  site:
www.jhfunds.com.  If you have  questions  about  the  merger,  you may also call
800-732-5543. Separately, for information about your investments in John Hancock
funds,   please  contact  your  financial   adviser  or  our  Customer   Service
representatives at 800-225-5291.

Sincerely,

MANAGERS'
REPORT

John Hancock
Patriot Premium
Dividend Fund II

Preferred  stocks  performed well amid mostly  favorable  conditions  during the
12-month  period ended  October 31, 2003.  Much of what was behind the preferred
stock rally was action by the Federal  Reserve  Board,  which  lowered  interest
rates on two separate  occasions during the year. Also boosting preferred stocks
was demand from income-seeking  individual investors and income-oriented  mutual
funds looking for significantly  higher yields than what companies paid on their
bonds and common stocks.  The yields on many preferred  stocks - which generally
ranged from 6% to 7% - continued  to outstrip by a fairly wide margin the yields
available on Treasury and  corporate  bonds,  as well as the  dividends  paid on
common  stocks.  Demand also  strengthened  in advance  of, and in response  to,
President Bushs dividend tax-cut  package,  which greatly reduced the taxes that
individuals pay on many stock  dividends.  A dramatic rise in interest rates and
bond yields in the summer briefly tempered an otherwise  favorable  backdrop for
fixed-income-oriented  investments, including preferreds. But they regained some
of their  footing by the final  months of the period  when  weaker-than-expected
economic reports helped to cool inflation concerns.

"Preferred stocks performed well amid mostly favor- able conditions during the
12-month period ended October 31, 2003."

Utility common stocks - the Funds other area of emphasis - performed even better
than preferreds,  buoyed by a combination of utility  companies ability to clean
up their balance sheets and improve corporate  earnings,  and strong demand from
investors  seeking  tax-advantaged   dividend-paying  stocks.  Even  the  August
electricity  blackout that plagued cities from New York to Cleveland did not dim
investors enthusiasm for the group. In

fact, the blackout helped underscore the need for better, expensive high-voltage
transmission  and  distribution  systems,  which  would  be  fostered  by  state
regulatory bodies granting the utilities higher allowable rates of return.

FUND PERFORMANCE

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, John Hancock Patriot Premium  Dividend
Fund II returned  21.24% at net asset value.  Over the same period,  the average
income and preferred stock closed-end fund returned 26.01%, according to Lipper,
Inc.  The  Funds  lag  stemmed   primarily  from  our  focus  on  high-  quality
investments;  lower-quality  junk names  soared  during the year in  response to
better-than-expected   corporate  earnings,   fewer  corporate  defaults  and  a
reduction in the rate of corporate credit downgrades.  Meanwhile, the Standard &
Poors 500 Index,  a broad measure of the overall stock market,  returned  20.79%
and the Dow Jones Utility  Average,  which tracks the performance of 15 electric
and natural gas utilities, returned 33.34%.

OIL & GAS SHINES

Preferred  stocks paying  tax-advantaged  dividends  were some of the Funds best
performers during the period.  In particular,  some of our  best-performing  and
largest  holdings in the  category  were oil and natural gas  companies  such as
Anadarko  Petroleum and Devon Energy which,  along with strong investor  demand,
were helped by relatively high energy prices and favorable energy  supply/demand
conditions.  In the electric  utility segment of the tax-  advantaged  preferred
group,  our winners  included  Boston Edison and Carolina Power & Light Co. They
got an added boost from their call protection,  meaning they had some measure of
protection  against  being  redeemed by their  issuer  before  maturity.  In the
financial segment,  our winners included J.P. Morgan Chase, which also benefited
from an increase in the growth of its private  banking  business,  as well as an
increased  market  share in stock and bond  underwriting.  Our  holdings in Bear
Stearns also posted good gains, primarily due to its ability

to avoid scandals and produce financial results that met or exceed expectations.

In the utility  common stock portion of the Fund, our best  performers  included
Alliant Energy,  Northeast Utilities and Dominion  Resources.  Alliant benefited
from its back-to-basics approach and improved balance sheet. Dominion was helped
by its  increasingly  valued oil and gas  reserves  and natural gas pipeline and
storage  assets.  Investors  rewarded  Northeast in large measure because of its
above-average  dividend  growth and its  attractive  service area,  which boasts
higher-than-average growth in electric usage.

In contrast,  our common  stock  holdings in Aquila Inc.  proved  disappointing.
Investors  punished the stock  because the company made an ill-timed  foray into
energy/merchant  trading,  which  forced  it to  take  write  downs  and  reduce
dividends.  That said,  we believe  that the  companys  efforts to return to its
regulated  electric  and gas roots and  reduce  debt  will help to  restore  its
financial health over time.

OUTLOOK

For the balance of 2003,  we remain  optimistic  about the outlook for preferred
and utility  common stocks.  Much of our optimism  stems from our  macroeconomic
outlook,  which calls for a slowly recovering economy coupled with sustained low
interest  rates,  which should  continue to prompt strong demand for  relatively
high-yielding  preferred and utility common  stocks.  Were also heartened by the
fact that  dividend  tax relief could help boost demand for many stocks that pay
high  dividends,  not only in the short term but also over the next decade or so
as more

aging  Americans  increasingly  seek  out  income-oriented  investment  options.
Utility  common stocks have other factors going for them as well,  including the
potential for more stable credit ratings, attractive valuations and the possible
elimination of an anachronistic law limiting utility mergers.

This commentary reflects the views of the portfolio  management team through the
end of the Funds period discussed in this report.  The teams statements  reflect
its own opinions.  As such, they are in no way guarantees of future events,  and
are not intended to be used as investment  advice or a recommendation  regarding
any specific security. They are also subject to change at any time as market and
other conditions warrant.

The Fund normally will invest more than 65% of its managed  assets in securities
of companies in the utilities industry.  Such an investment  concentration makes
the Fund more susceptible than a broader  diversified fund to factors  adversely
affecting the utilities  industry.  Sector investing is subject to greater risks
than the market as a whole.

NOTES TO
STATEMENTS
- ----------

NOTE A
Accounting policies

John  Hancock  Patriot  Premium  Dividend  Fund II (the  Fund) is a  diversified
closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

Significant accounting policies of the Fund are as follows:

Valuation of investments

Securities in the Funds portfolio are valued on the basis of market  quotations,
valuations  provided  by  independent  pricing  services  or at  fair  value  as
determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Trustees.
Short-term  debt  investments  maturing  within 60 days are valued at  amortized
cost, which  approximates  market value. The Fund determines the net asset value
of the common shares each business day.

Investment transactions

Investment  transactions  are  recorded  as of the  date  of  purchase,  sale or
maturity.  Net realized gains and losses on sales of investments  are determined
on the identified cost basis.

Expenses

The majority of the expenses are directly  identifiable  to an individual  fund.
Expenses that are not readily  identifiable  to a specific fund are allocated in
such a manner  as deemed  equitable,  taking  into  consideration,  among  other
things, the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the funds.

Federal income taxes

The Fund  qualifies  as a regulated  investment  company by  complying  with the
applicable  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue Code and will not be subject to
federal  income tax on  taxable  income  that is  distributed  to  shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. The Fund paid $93,891 of
federal  excise due to  calendar  year  distribution  requirements.  For federal
income  tax  purposes,  the Fund has  $555,078  of a capital  loss  carryforward
available, to the extent provided by regulations,  to offset future net realized
capital  gains.  To the extent that such  carryforward  is used by the Fund,  no
capital gain distributions will be made. The entire loss carryforward expires as
follows: October 31, 2010 - $533,811 and October 31, 2011 - $21,267.

Dividends, interest and distributions

Dividend income on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend date or,
in the case of some foreign  securities,  on the date  thereafter  when the Fund
identifies the dividend. Interest income on investment securities is recorded on
the accrual basis.  Foreign income may be subject to foreign  withholding taxes,
which are accrued as applicable.

The Fund records  distributions  to common and preferred  shareholders  from net
investment income and realized gains on the



                                                                              13
<PAGE>


ex-dividend  date.  During the year ended October 31, 2003, the tax character of
distributions paid was as follows: ordinary income $16,582,725.

As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable  earnings on a tax basis
included $4,016,395 of undistributed ordinary income.

Such distributions to common shareholders,  and distributable earnings, on a tax
basis,  are  determined in  conformity  with income tax  regulations,  which may
differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of
America.  Distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits, if any, are
reported in the Funds financial statements as a return of capital.

Use of estimates The  preparation of these financial  statements,  in accordance
with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America,
incorporates  estimates made by management in determining the reported amount of
assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses of the Fund.  Actual  results could
differ from these estimates.

NOTE B
Management fee and transactions with affiliates and others

The Fund has an investment  management contract with John Hancock Advisers,  LLC
(the Adviser),  a wholly owned subsidiary of The Berkeley  Financial Group, LLC.
Under the investment management contract, the Fund pays a monthly management fee
to the Adviser at an annual rate of 0.50% of the Funds average weekly net assets
and the value  attributable  to the DARTS,  plus 5.00% of the Funds weekly gross
income.  The  Advisers  total fee is limited to a maximum  amount equal to 1.00%
annually of the Funds average  weekly net assets and the value  attributable  to
the DARTS.  For the year ended  October 31, 2003,  the advisory fee incurred did
not exceed the maximum advisory fee allowed.

The Fund has an  administrative  agreement  with the  Adviser  under  which  the
Adviser oversees the custodial,  auditing,  valuation,  accounting, legal, stock
transfer and dividend disbursing services and maintains Fund communications with
the shareholders.  The Fund pays the Adviser a monthly  administration fee at an
annual  rate of 0.10% of the  Funds  average  weekly  net  assets  and the value
attributable to the preferred shares.

Ms. Maureen Ford Goldfarb and Mr. John M. DeCiccio are directors and/or officers
of the Adviser  and/or its  affiliates,  as well as  Trustees  of the Fund.  The
compensation  of  unaffiliated  Trustees is borne by the Fund. The  unaffiliated
Trustees may elect to defer for tax purposes their receipt of this  compensation
under the John Hancock Group of Funds  Deferred  Compen-  sation Plan.  The Fund
makes  investments  into other John Hancock funds,  as applicable,  to cover its
liability for the deferred compensation. Investments to cover the Funds deferred
compensation  liability  are recorded on the Funds books as an other asset.  The
deferred compensation liability and the related other asset are always equal and
are marked to market on a periodic  basis to  reflect  any income  earned by the
investments  as well as any  unrealized  gains or losses.  The Deferred  Compen-
sation Plan investments had no impact on the operations of the Fund.

Dutch Auction Rate Transferable  Securities preferred shares Series A and Series
B

The Fund issued Dutch  Auction Rate  Transferable  Securities  preferred  shares
(DARTS),  598  shares  of  Series  A and 598  shares  of  Series  B, in a public
offering.  The underwriting  discount was recorded as a reduction of the capital
of common  shares.  During the year ended October 31, 1990,  the Fund retired 98
shares of DARTS from both Series A and Series B.

Dividends on the DARTS,  which accrue daily,  are  cumulative at a rate that was
established  at the  offering  of the  DARTS  and has been  reset  every 49 days
thereafter by an auction.  Dividend rates on DARTS Series A ranged from 0.95% to
1.76% and on Series B from 0.93% to 1.85%,  during the year  ended  October  31,
2003. Accrued dividends on DARTS are included in the value of DARTS on the Funds
statement of assets and liabilities.

The DARTS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption  price equal
to $100,000 per share,  plus  accumulated  and unpaid  dividends on any dividend
payment date. The DARTS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption
price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the
Fund is in default on its asset coverage requirements with respect to the DARTS,
as defined in the Funds  by-laws.  If the  dividends  on the DARTS shall  remain
unpaid in an amount equal to two full years dividends, the holders of the DARTS,
as a class,  have the right to elect a  majority  of the Board of  Trustees.  In
general,  the holders of the DARTS and the common shareholders have equal voting
rights of one vote per share,  except that the holders of the DARTS, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Trustees, and separate class votes are
required on certain  matters that affect the  respective  interests of the DARTS
and common shareholders.

Investment
transactions

Purchases  and proceeds  from sales and  maturities  of  securities,  other than
short-term  securities and obligations of the U.S.  government,  during the year
ended October 31, 2003,  aggregated  $23,323,329 and $39,128,979,  respectively.
The cost of  invest-  ments  owned on October  31,  2003,  including  short-term
investments, for federal income tax purposes was $273,410,152.  Gross unrealized
appreciation  and  depreciation  of  investments   aggregated   $20,537,538  and
$25,960,043,   respectively,   resulting  in  net  unrealized   depreciation  of
$5,422,505.  The  difference  between  book  basis and tax basis net  unrealized
depreciation  of  investments is  attributable  primarily to the tax deferral of
losses on certain sales of securities.



                                                                              15

NOTE E

Reclassification of accounts

During the year ended October 31, 2003, the Fund reclassified amounts to reflect
a decrease in accumulated  net realized loss on investments of $262, an increase
in  accumulated  net  investment  income of $94,604  and a  decrease  in capital
paid-in of  $94,866.  This  represents  the  amount  necessary  to report  these
balances on a tax basis, excluding certain temporary differences,  as of October
31, 2003. Additional  adjustments may be needed in subsequent reporting periods.
These  reclassifications,  which  have no impact  on the net asset  value of the
Fund, are primarily  attributable  to certain  differences in the computation of
distributable income and capital gains under federal tax rules versus accounting
principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America and book and tax
differences in accounting for deferred  compensation and federal excise tax. The
calculation of net investment income per share in the Funds Financial Highlights
excludes these adjustments.

AUDITORS
REPORT

Report of
Deloitte & Touche LLP,
Independent Auditors

To The Board of  Trustees  and  Shareholders  of John  Hancock  Patriot  Premium
Dividend Fund II,

We have audited the  accompanying  statement of assets and  liabilities  of John
Hancock  Patriot  Premium  Dividend Fund II (the Fund) including the schedule of
investments, as of October 31, 2003, and the related statement of operations for
the year then ended,  the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the
five years in the period then ended.  These  financial  statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these  financial  statements  and financial  highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at October 31, 2003, by  correspondence  with the custodian and
brokers,  where  replies  were not received  from  brokers,  we performed  other
auditing procedures.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and  significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such  financial  statements  and financial  highlights  present
fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of the Fund at October
31, 2003, the results of its  operations,  the changes in its net assets and its
financial  highlights  for the respective  stated  periods,  in conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

TAX
INFORMATION

Unaudited

For federal  income tax purposes,  the following  information  is furnished with
respect to the  distributions  of the Fund, if any, paid during its taxable year
ended October 31, 2003.

With  respect to the  ordinary  dividends  paid by the Fund for the fiscal  year
ended  October 31,  2003,  100.00% of the  dividends  qualify for the  corporate
dividends-received deduction.

The Fund hereby  designates  the  maximum  amount  allowable  of its net taxable
income as  qualified  dividend  income as  provided  in the Jobs and  Growth Tax
Relief  Reconciliation  Act of  2003.  This  amount  will be  reflected  on Form
1099-DIV for the calendar year 2003.

Shareholders  will be mailed a 2003 U.S.  Treasury  Department  Form 1099-DIV in
January 2004. This will reflect the total of all distributions  that are taxable
for the calendar year 2003.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICY

The Funds investment objective is to provide high current income consistent with
modest  growth of  capital  for  holders  of its  common  shares  of  beneficial
interest.  The Fund will pursue its  objective  by  investing  in a  diversified
portfolio of dividend paying preferred and common stocks.

The Funds  non-fundamental  investment  policy,  with  respect to the quality of
ratings  of its  portfolio  investments,  was  changed  by a vote  of the  Funds
Trustees on September 13, 1994. This policy,  which became effective October 15,
1994,  stipulates that preferred  stocks and debt  obligations in which the Fund
will  invest  will be  rated  investment-grade  (at  least  BBB by S&P or Baa by
Moodys)  at the time of  investment  or will be  preferred  stocks of issuers of
investment-grade   senior   debt,   some   of   which   may   have   speculative
characteristics,  or, if not rated, will be of comparable  quality as determined
by the Adviser.  The Fund will invest in common  stocks of issuers  whose senior
debt is rated  investment-grade  or, in the case of  issuers  that have no rated
senior debt outstanding, whose senior debt is considered by the Adviser to be of
comparable quality.  This policy supersedes the requirement that at least 80% of
the Funds total assets consist of preferred stocks and debt obligations  rated A
or higher and dividend-paying common stocks whose issuers have senior debt rated
A or higher.

On November 20, 2001,  the Funds  Trustees  approved  the  following  investment
policy investment restriction change,  effective December 15, 2001. Under normal
circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in dividend-paying
securities.  The Assets are  defined as net  assets  including  the  liquidation
preference amount of the DARTS plus borrowings for investment purposes. The Fund
will  notify  shareholders  at least 60 days  prior  to any  change  in this 80%
investment policy.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers its shareholders a Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), which
offers the opportunity to earn compounded  yields.  Each holder of common shares
may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains reinvested by
Mellon Investor  Services,  as plan agent for the common  shareholders (the Plan
Agent).  Holders of common  shares who do not elect to  participate  in the Plan
will receive all  distributions  in cash,  paid by check mailed  directly to the
shareholder  of record  (or,  if the  common  shares are held in street or other
nominee  name,  then to the nominee) by the Plan Agent,  as dividend  disbursing
agent.

Shareholders may join the Plan by filling out and mailing an authorization card,
by  notifying  the Plan Agent by  telephone,  or by visiting the Plan Agents Web
site at  www.melloninvestor.com.  Shareholders  must  indicate  an  election  to
reinvest  all or a portion of dividend  payments.  If received in proper form by
the Plan Agent  before the  record  date of a  dividend,  the  election  will be
effective   with  respect  to  all  dividends   paid  after  such  record  date.
Shareholders  whose  shares are held in the name of a broker or  nominee  should
contact the broker or nominee to determine  whether and how they may participate
in the Plan.

If the Fund  declares a  dividend  payable  either in common  shares or in cash,
nonparticipants  will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the
equivalent  in common  shares.  If the market price of the common  shares on the
payment  date of the  dividend  is equal to or exceeds  their net asset value as
determined on the payment date,  participants  will be issued common shares (out
of authorized  but unissued  shares) at a value equal to the higher of net asset
value or 95% of the market  price.  If the net asset  value  exceeds  the market
price of



                                                                              19
<PAGE>


the common shares at such time, or if the Board of Trustees  declares a dividend
payable only in cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan  participants,  buy
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,  for the
participants  accounts.  Such  purchases will be made promptly after the payable
date for such dividend  and, in any event,  prior to the next  ex-dividend  date
after such date, except where necessary to comply with federal  securities laws.
If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,  the market price exceeds
the net asset value of the common  shares,  the average per share purchase price
paid by the Plan  Agent may exceed  the net asset  value of the  common  shares,
resulting in the  acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund.

Each  participant  will pay a pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred
with  respect to the Plan Agents open market  purchases in  connection  with the
reinvestment of dividends and distributions. In each case, the cost per share of
the shares  purchased  for each  participants  account will be the average cost,
including brokerage commissions, of any shares purchased on the open market plus
the cost of any shares  issued by the Fund.  There will be no brokerage  charges
with respect to common  shares issued  directly by the Fund.  There are no other
charges to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gain distributions.

Participants  in the Plan may withdraw  from the Plan at any time by  contacting
the Plan Agent by telephone,  in writing or by visiting the Plan Agents Web site
at  www.melloninvestor.com.  Such  withdrawal  will be effective  immediately if
received not less than ten days prior to a dividend record date;  otherwise,  it
will be effective for all subsequent  dividend record dates.  When a participant
withdraws  from the Plan or upon  termination  of the Plan,  as provided  below,
certificates  for whole common  shares  credited to his or her account under the
Plan will be issued and a cash  payment will be made for any fraction of a share
credited to such account.

The Plan Agent  maintains  each  shareholders  account in the Plan and furnishes
monthly written  confirmations  of all  transactions in the accounts,  including
information  needed by the shareholders  for personal and tax records.  The Plan
Agent  will hold  common  shares in the  account  of each  Plan  participant  in
noncertificated form in the name of the participant.  Proxy material relating to
the  shareholders  meetings of the Fund will include  those shares  purchased as
well as shares held pursuant to the Plan.

The reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve participants of
any  federal  income tax that may be payable or  required to be withheld on such
dividends  or  distributions.  Participants  under  the Plan  will  receive  tax
information  annually.  The amount of dividend to be reported on 1099-DIV should
be (1) in the case of shares  issued by the Fund,  the fair market value of such
shares on the dividend  payment date and (2) in the case of shares  purchased by
the Plan Agent in the open market,  the amount of cash used by the Plan Agent to
purchase  shares in the open market,  including the amount of cash  allocated to
brokerage commissions paid on such purchases.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.  Accordingly,
the Fund  reserves  the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as applied to any
dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change sent to
all  shareholders  of the Fund at least 90 days  before the record  date for the
dividend  or  distribution.  The Plan may be amended or  terminated  by the Plan
Agent after at least 90 days written notice to all shareholders of

the Fund.  All  correspondence  or additional  information  concerning  the Plan
should be directed to the Plan Agent,  Mellon Bank,  N.A.,  c/o Mellon  Investor
Services,   P.O.  Box  3338,   South   Hackensack,   NJ  07606-1938   (telephone

SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS

In November 2002, the Board of Trustees adopted several  amendments to the Funds
by-laws,  including  provisions relating to the calling of a special meeting and
requiring advance notice of shareholder  proposals or nominees for Trustee.  The
advance notice provisions in the by-laws require shareholders to notify the Fund
in writing of any proposal  which they intend to present at an annual meeting of
shareholders,  including any  nominations  for Trustee,  between 90 and 120 days
prior to the first  anniversary of the mailing date of the notice from the prior
years  annual  meeting of  shareholders.  The  notification  must be in the form
prescribed by the by-laws.  The advance notice  provisions  provide the Fund and
its  Trustees  with the  opportunity  to  thoughtfully  consider and address the
matters  proposed  before the Fund  prepares  and mails its proxy  statement  to
shareholders. Other amendments set forth the procedures that must be followed in
order  for a  shareholder  to call a special  meeting  of  shareholders.  Please
contact the Secretary of the Fund for additional  information  about the advance
notice requirements or the other amendments to the by-laws.



                                                                              21

[J1]JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS

CODE OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

General Principles

The Trustees of the registered investment companies (the "Funds" or each a
"Fund") managed by John Hancock Advisers, LLC (the "Adviser") have adopted this
code of ethics (this "Code") setting forth standards of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (respectively, the
principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal
accounting officer, the "Senior Financial Officers") of each Fund. All Senior
Financial Officers are charged with the duty to maintain the standards set forth
below.

No Code can address every situation that a Senior Financial Officer might face.
As a guiding principle, Senior Financial Officers should strive to implement the
spirit as well as the letter of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to
provide the type of clear and complete disclosure and information that Fund
shareholders have a right to expect.

Senior Financial Officer should not engage in personal, business or professional
relationships or dealings which would impair his or her independence of judgment
or adversely affect the performance of his or her duties in the best interests
of each Fund and its shareholders. Any relationship or dealing that would
present a conflict for a Senior Financial Officer could also present a conflict
if it is related to a member of his or her immediate family.

information included in reports filed with regulatory agencies and public

Compliance Procedures

All Senior Financial Officers are responsible for ensuring that their own
conduct complies with this Code. If a Senior Financial Officer is aware of any

rise to a conflict of interest or which might be viewed as potentially affecting
his or her performance of Fund responsibilities, the Senior Financial Officer
shall notify the Fund's Chief Legal Officer of this transaction or relationship.
In addition, any Senior Financial Officer who becomes aware of any existing or
potential violation of this Code shall notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly,
who shall conduct an appropriate investigation. The Chief Legal Officer shall
report any violation of this Code to the Audit Committee of the Fund. If a
Senior Financial Officer believes that his or her responsibilities as an officer
or employee of the Adviser are likely to materially compromise his or her
objectivity or ability to perform the duties of his or her role as an officer of
the Funds, he or she should consult with the Adviser's Chief Legal Officer, the
Fund's Chief Legal Officer or outside counsel, or counsel to the independent
Trustees of the Funds. Under appropriate circumstances, a Senior Financial
Officer should also consider whether to present the matter to the Trustees of
the Funds or a committee thereof.

violation or refuses to cooperate in the investigation of any potential
violation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
Subject to applicable law, the Audit Committee may waive provisions of this
Code.

effects on the Adviser and the Funds. The Trustees of the Funds recognize that

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES
<TEXT>
John Hancock Advisers, LLC
Sovereign Asset Management Corporation
Proxy Voting Guidelines

We believe in placing our clients' interests first. Before we invest in a
particular stock or bond, our team of portfolio managers and research analysts
look closely at the company by examining its earnings history, its management
team and its place in the market. Once we invest, we monitor all our clients'
holdings, to ensure that they maintain their potential to produce results for
investors.

As part of our active investment management strategy, we keep a close eye on
each company we invest in. Routinely, companies issue proxies by which they ask
investors like us to vote for or against a change, such as a new management
team, a new business procedure or an acquisition. We base our decisions on how
to vote these proxies with the goal of maximizing the value of our clients'
investments.

Currently,  John Hancock  Advisers,  LLC ("JHA") and Sovereign Asset  Management
Corporation ("Sovereign") manage open-end funds, closed-end funds and portfolios
for  institutions and  high-net-worth  investors.  Occasionally,  we utilize the
expertise of an outside asset manager by means of a  subadvisory  agreement.  In
all  cases,  JHA or  Sovereign  makes the final  decision  as to how to vote our
clients'  proxies.  There is one  exception,  however,  and that pertains to our
international   accounts.  The  investment  management  team  for  international
investments  votes the proxies for the accounts  they manage.  Unless  voting is
specifically  retained by the named  fiduciary of the client,  JHA and Sovereign
will vote proxies for ERISA clients.

In order to ensure a consistent, balanced approach across all our investment
teams, we have established a proxy oversight group comprised of associates from
our investment, operations and legal teams. The group has developed a set of
policies and procedures that detail the standards for how JHA and Sovereign vote
proxies. The guidelines of JHA have been approved and adopted by each fund
client's board of trustees who have voted to delegate proxy voting authority to
their investment adviser, JHA. JHA and Sovereign's other clients have granted us
the authority to vote proxies in our advisory contracts or comparable documents.

JHA and Sovereign have hired a third party proxy voting service which has been
instructed to vote all proxies in accordance with our established guidelines
except as otherwise instructed.

In evaluating proxy issues, our proxy oversight group may consider information
from many sources, including the portfolio manager, management of a company
presenting a proposal, shareholder groups, and independent proxy research
services. Proxies for securities on loan through securities lending programs
will generally not be voted, however a decision may be made to recall a security
for voting purposes if the issue is material.

Below are the guidelines we adhere to when voting proxies. Please keep in mind
that these are purely guidelines. Our actual votes will be driven by the
particular circumstances of each proxy. From time to time votes may ultimately
be cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. Decisions on these matters (case-by-case,
abstention, recall) will normally be made by a portfolio manager under the
supervision of the chief investment officer and the proxy oversight group. We
may abstain from voting a proxy if we conclude that the effect on our clients'
economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or
insignificant.

Proxy Voting Guidelines

Board of Directors

We believe good corporate governance evolves from an independent board.

We support the election of uncontested director nominees, but will withhold our
vote for any nominee attending less than 75% of the board and committee meetings
during the previous fiscal year. Contested elections will be considered on a
case by case basis by the proxy oversight group, taking into account the
nominee's qualifications. We will support management's ability to set the size
of the board of directors and to fill vacancies without shareholder approval but
will not support a board that has fewer than 3 directors or allows for the
removal of a director without cause.

We will support declassification of a board and block efforts to adopt a
classified board structure. This structure typically divides the board into
classes with each class serving a staggered term.

In addition, we support proposals for board indemnification and limitation of
director liability, as long as they are consistent with corporate law and
shareholders' interests. We believe that this is necessary to attract qualified
board members.

Selection of Auditors

We believe an independent audit committee can best determine an auditor's
qualifications.

We will vote for management proposals to ratify the board's selection of
auditors, and for proposals to increase the independence of audit committees.

Capitalization

We will vote for a proposal to increase or decrease authorized common or
preferred stock and the issuance of common stock, but will vote against a
proposal to issue or convert preferred or multiple classes of stock if the board
has unlimited rights to set the terms and conditions of the shares, or if the
shares have voting rights inferior or superior to those of other shareholders.

In addition, we will support a management proposal to: create or restore
preemptive rights; approve a stock repurchase program; approve a stock split or
reverse stock split; and, approve the issuance or exercise of stock warrants

Acquisitions, mergers and corporate restructuring

Proposals to merge with or acquire another company will be voted on a
case-by-case basis, as will proposals for recapitalization, restructuring,
leveraged buyout, sale of assets, bankruptcy or liquidation. We will vote
against a reincorporation proposal if it would reduce shareholder rights. We
will vote against a management proposal to ratify or adopt a poison pill or to
establish a supermajority voting provision to approve a merger or other business
combination. We would however support a management proposal to opt out of a
state takeover statutory provision, to spin-off certain operations or divisions
and to establish a fair price provision.

Corporate Structure and Shareholder Rights

In general, we support proposals that foster good corporate governance
procedures and that provide shareholders with voting power equal to their equity
interest in the company.

To preserve shareholder rights, we will vote against a management proposal to
restrict shareholders' right to: call a special meeting and to eliminate a
shareholders' right to act by written consent. In addition, we will not support
a management proposal to adopt a supermajority vote requirement to change
certain by-law or charter provisions or a non-technical amendment to by-laws or
a charter that reduces shareholder rights.

Equity-based compensation

Equity-based compensation is designed to attract, retain and motivate talented
executives and independent directors, but should not be so significant as to
materially dilute shareholders' interests.

We will vote against the adoption or amendment of a stock option plan if the: *
plan dilution is more than 10% of outstanding common stock,
* plan allows for non-qualified options to be priced at less than 85% of the
fair market value on the grant date,
* company allows or has allowed the re-pricing or replacement of underwater
options in the past fiscal year (or the exchange of underwater options).

With respect to the adoption or amendment of employee stock purchase plans or a
stock award plan, we will vote against management if: * the plan allows stock to
be purchased at less than 85% of fair market value; * this plan dilutes
outstanding common equity greater than 10% * all stock purchase plans, including
the proposed plan, exceed 15% of outstanding common equity.

Other Business

For routine business matters which are the subject of many proxy related
questions, we will vote with management proposals to: * change the company name;
* approve other business; * adjourn meetings; * make technical amendments to the
by-laws or charters; * approve financial statements; * approve an employment
agreement or contract.

Shareholder Proposals

Shareholders are permitted per SEC regulations to submit proposals for inclusion
in a company's proxy statement. We will generally vote against shareholder
proposals and in accordance with the recommendation of management except as
follows where we will vote for proposals: * calling for shareholder ratification
of auditors; * calling for auditors to attend annual meetings; * seeking to
increase board independence; * requiring minimum stock ownership by directors; *
seeking to create a nominating committee or to increase the independence of the
nominating committee; * seeking to increase the independence of the audit
committee.

Corporate and social policy issues

We believe that "ordinary business matters" are primarily the responsibility of
management and should be approved solely by the corporation's board of
directors.

Proposals in this category, initiated primarily by shareholders, typically
request that the company disclose or amend certain business practices. We
generally vote against business practice proposals and abstain on social policy
issues, though we may make exceptions in certain instances where we believe a
proposal has substantial economic implications.


John Hancock Advisers, LLC
Sovereign Asset Management Corporation
Proxy Voting Procedures

The role of the proxy voting service
John Hancock Advisers, LLC ("JHA") and Sovereign Asset Management Corporation
("Sovereign") have hired a proxy voting service to assist with the voting of
client proxies. The proxy service coordinates with client custodians to ensure
that proxies are received for securities held in client accounts and acted on in
a timely manner. The proxy service votes all proxies received in accordance with
the proxy voting guidelines established and adopted by JHA and Sovereign. When
it is unclear how to apply a particular proxy voting guideline or when a
particular proposal is not covered by the guidelines, the proxy voting service
will contact the proxy oversight group coordinator for a resolution.

The role of the proxy oversight group and coordinator
The coordinator will interact directly with the proxy voting service to resolve
any issues the proxy voting service brings to the attention of JHA or Sovereign.
When a question arises regarding how a proxy should be voted the coordinator
contacts the firm's investment professionals and the proxy oversight group for a
resolution. In addition the coordinator ensures that the proxy voting service
receives responses in a timely manner. Also, the coordinator is responsible for
identifying whether, when a voting issue arises, there is a potential conflict
of interest situation and then escalating the issue to the firm's Executive
Committee. For securities out on loan as part of a securities lending program,
if a decision is made to vote a proxy, the coordinator will manage the
return/recall of the securities so the proxy can be voted.

The role of mutual fund trustees
The boards of trustees of our mutual fund clients have reviewed and adopted the
proxy voting guidelines of the funds' investment adviser, JHA. The trustees will
periodically review the proxy voting guidelines and suggest changes they deem
advisable.

Conflicts of interest

Conflicts of interest are resolved in the best interest of clients.

With respect to potential conflicts of interest, proxies will be voted in
accordance with JHA's or Sovereign's predetermined policies. If application of
the predetermined policy is unclear or does not address a particular proposal, a
special internal review by the JHA Executive Committee or Sovereign Executive
Committee will determine the vote. After voting, a report will be made to the
client (in the case of an investment company, to the fund's board of trustees),
if requested. An example of a conflict of interest created with respect to a
proxy solicitation is when JHA or Sovereign must vote the proxies of companies
that they provide investment advice to or are currently seeking to provide
investment advice to, such as to pension plans. S:\Corporate
