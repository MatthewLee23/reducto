held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS as of November 30, 2004
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

The municipal bond market is a center of capital formation for states,
municipalities and, in some cases, private economic initiatives. In this
edition of our continuing educational series, we will discuss industrial
development revenue (IDR) bonds. IDR bonds have long been used as a financing
mechanism by local governments to provide assistance to local employers and
encourage job retention and creation within their communities.

IDR BONDS FINANCE PRIVATE ACTIVITIES THAT BENEFIT THE PUBLIC...

IDR bonds are issued by municipal authorities to finance projects and facilities
used by private corporations. Historically, IDR bonds have represented a
partnership between the private and public sectors - a source of dedicated
funding for companies and a source of job creation in projects beneficial to
local communities. The "Private-Activities" provision of the Tax Reform Act of
1986 permits issuance of tax-exempt bonds for specific activities, including
pollution control; gas and electric service; water distribution; wastewater
systems; solid waste disposal; airports and selected transportation projects;
and other industrial projects.

The Act also placed a cap on the dollar amount that may be raised for IDR bonds
in each state, limiting the amount to $50 per person/per state/per year, with a
$150 million maximum. These limitations provide protection against potential
abuse and ensure that tax-exempt IDR bonds will indeed be issued for projects
that will benefit the public.

IDR BONDS FINANCE UTILITY-RELATED PROJECTS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL INITIATIVES...

Typically, IDR bond projects provide financing for manufacturing, processing or
utility facilities. Historically, about one-half of these bonds have been issued
to finance pollution control facilities for manufacturers and electric
utilities. As many utilities and manufacturers have been ordered to comply with
stricter environmental and fuel standards, pollution control bonds have helped
finance the retrofits of existing plants. Other IDR bonds have served as
inducements from state and local issuers to locate plants or build new
facilities, in the hope that such construction might generate further economic
growth for a community.

IDR BONDS ARE SECURED BY CORPORATE REVENUES - NOT THOSE OF STATE OR LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS...

IDR bond issues are secured by the credit of the underlying corporation. The
municipal issuing authority acts solely as a conduit to permit tax-exempt
financing. The corporation pledges to make payments sufficient to meet all debt
service obligations. Unlike some revenue issues, IDR bonds are backed by
revenues of the entire corporation, not solely by those of the project being
financed.

Because IDR bonds are backed by corporate revenues and not by the taxing
authority of a state or local jurisdiction, they have historically provided
coupon premiums above those of general obligations and other more traditional
revenue bonds. Bonds may be either collateralized or unsecured. Collateralized
bonds have a lien against the company's assets, which may provide bond holders
enhanced bargaining power in the event of a bankruptcy. Unsecured bonds have
no such lien.

WHILE PROVIDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES, IDR BONDS REQUIRE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS...

While IDR bonds may provide unusual investment opportunities, they also may
entail increased risk, and therefore, demand especially intensive analysis. At
Eaton Vance, we have credit analysts and resources dedicated to IDR bond
research.

IDR bonds represent a key segment of the municipal bond market and should
remain an important source of capital formation. In our view, the experience
and resources needed to evaluate these issues further demonstrates the value of
professional management. We will continue to look for opportunities in this
sector of the municipal market.

                                              Sincerely,

                                              /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

                                              Thomas J. Fetter

MARKET RECAP

The expansion of the U.S. economy continued throughout the year ended
November 30, 2004, bolstered by the strengthening employment data that emerged
at the end of the fiscal year. One key economic factor during the period was the
surge in gasoline and energy prices, which raised fears that inflation could
re-emerge. Amid those concerns, bond market performance was less robust in the
second half of the year than in the first half.

IN AN UNEVEN ECONOMY, SOME SECTORS GENERATED GROWTH...

The nation's Gross Domestic Product grew by 4.0% in the third quarter of 2004, a
stronger showing than previously estimated, following a 3.3% rise in the second
quarter. Economic activity was uneven, with some segments slowing and others
growing at varying rates. For example, auto sales were impacted by higher gas
prices, with buyers opting for fuel-efficient smaller vehicles over SUVs and
trucks.

Interestingly, manufacturing activity grew stronger, driven by rising demand for
durable goods and capital equipment. Demand for aerospace equipment, steel
products, industrial machinery, and information technology products was
especially strong. Non-durable goods manufacturing, tied more closely to
consumer spending, weakened significantly. The construction sector followed
recent patterns, with residential building on the rise, while commercial
activity lagged.

MEANWHILE, JOB GROWTH HAS GAINED SOME STRENGTH...

The employment picture continued to puzzle many economists throughout the year.
Despite having made significant productivity improvements during the recent
economic downturn, many businesses were slow to return to previous employment
levels. As a result, job gains during the summer and early fall fell short of
expectations. However, reports released in December 2004 brought news of a
surge in new employment, with the number of new jobs rising and the number of
Americans filing initial jobless claims falling. The nation's unemployment rate
fell to 5.4% in November 2004, down from 5.9% a year earlier. A resurgence in
hiring in 2004 would allow for continued consumer spending in the new year, the
key driver in an economy potentially on pace for its strongest rate of growth in
several years.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUSHED SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES HIGHER IN 2004...

Amid soaring oil prices and a weaker U.S. dollar - each a potential inflation
threat - the Federal Reserve continued its tighter monetary policy, emphasizing
that it would fight any signs of inflation. After maintaining a stable
interest rate policy for more than a year, the Fed raised its benchmark
Federal Funds rate 5 times since June of 2004, with the fifth increase on
December 15, 2004, pushing the key interest rate to 2.25%.

Following a strong rally in the first half of the year, the municipal bond
market lost some momentum in the second half, as inflation remained a concern
for fixed-income investors. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index had a total return of 4.07%.*

*It is not possible to invest directly in an Index. The Index's total return
does not reflect commissions or expenses that would have been incurred if an
investor individually purchased or sold the securities represented in the

EATON VANCE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST as of November 30, 2004
INVESTMENT UPDATE

THE TRUST

- -  Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
   total return of 8.60% for the year ended November 30, 2004. That return was
   the result of an increase in share price from $14.95 on November 30, 2003 to
   $15.16 on November 30, 2004 and the reinvestment of $1.023 in regular monthly
   dividends.(1)

- -  Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 5.34% for the year
   ended November 30, 2004. That return was the result of a decrease in net
   asset value per share from $15.32 on November 30, 2003 to $15.07 on
   November 30, 2004, and the reinvestment of all distributions.(1)

- -  In comparison, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index had a total return of
   4.07% during the year ended November 30, 2004.(2)

- -  Based on the last dividend of the fiscal year and a share price of $15.16,
   the Trust had a market yield of 6.75% at November 30, 2004.(3) The Trust's
   market yield is equivalent to a taxable yield of 11.45%.(4) The dividend
   declared on December 31, 2004, reflects a reduction of the monthly dividend
   of $0.005 per share.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Although California is no longer losing jobs, job growth continued to lag the
   nation. The technology sector showed some signs of improvement, while energy,
   construction, business services and new business creation remained strong.
   The state's jobless rate was 5.7% in November 2004, down from 6.6% a year
   ago.

- -  Insured* general obligations bonds (GOs) were the Trust's largest sector
   weighting at November 30, 2004. The Trust's investments focused primarily on
   local school district bonds. Given the slow recovery of the California
   economy, insured* GOs provided an added measure of security.

- -  Special tax revenue bonds were significant investments. These bonds helped
   finance infrastructure and improvements that benefited local property owners.
   The bonds are backed by revenues from special assessments on these
   California communities.

- -  Hospital bonds were prominent holdings in the Trust. Given stricter Medicare
   reimbursements and intense industry competition, management focused on
   institutions we believe have sound financial structures and good management
   and are well-positioned in their local markets.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   35.3% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the
   issuance of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an
   opportunity for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special
   risks (including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value
   and market price of common shares).

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND
ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE
PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. INVESTMENT RETURN AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR
LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME PERIOD ONLY;
DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE TRUST'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER
THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Florida's economic rebound has been among the strongest in the nation.
   Rebuilding from this year's difficult hurricane season has generated
   additional momentum in the construction industry. State tourism continued its
   recovery, with visitor levels up from a year earlier. The state's November
   2004 jobless rate was 4.3%, down from 4.9% a year ago.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector
   weighting at November 30, 2004. These issues have financed key projects
   within Florida's air, seaport and highway matrix. The Trust's holdings
   included issues that financed a five-year improvement program intended to
   ease Miami's traffic congestion.

- -  Insured* water and sewer issuers remained a focus for the Trust.
   Historically, water and sewer bonds have offered a stable revenue stream in
   any economic climate. These issues provided funding for Florida communities
   that were upgrading their water facilities.

- -  Insured* special tax revenue bonds constituted a major investment. These
   bonds are secured by the levy of special assessments by local governments and
   helped defray the costs on improvements and infrastructure for Florida
   communities.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  The Massachusetts economy continued to improve in 2004, although job creation
   lagged the national rate. A continuing strong residential real estate market
   boosted the construction sector, and the state's key financial sector
   reflected stronger financial markets. The state's November 2004 jobless rate
   was 4.6%, down from 5.7% a year ago and below the national rate.

- -  Insured* and uninsured education bonds were the Trust's largest sector
   weightings at November 30, 2004. Investments included some of the Common-
   wealth's most acclaimed universities and secondary schools. Historically,
   these institutions have enjoyed strong applicant demand and stable-to-rising
   tuition income.

- -  Hospital bonds were significant investments, representing a geographically
   diverse range of institutions, Management emphasized hospitals with sound
   cost structures, good market share and in-demand health care specialities.

- -  Management continued its efforts to upgrade, where possible, the credit
   quality of the Trust's investments. Another key strategy was trading bonds
   with nearing call dates in favor of non-callable bonds and bonds with
   longer-dated calls. This shift could improve the Trust's appreciation
   potential in the event of a market rally.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   34.6% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the
   issuance of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an
   opportunity for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special
   risks (including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and
   market price of common shares).

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Michigan's recovery has been among the weakest of the states. The
   manufacturing sector has been especially hard-hit, but government jobs -
   pressured by budgetary restraints - have also declined. The construction and
   furniture industries fared well. The state's November 2004 jobless rate was
   7.0%, down from 7.6% a year ago.

- -  Hospital bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector weighting at
   November 30, 2004. The Trust's investments were diversified geographically
   throughout the state and included some of the state's finest acute care
   facilities. These hospitals offer a wide variety of specialized medical care,
   including cardiac and pediatric care.

- -  Insured* and uninsured general obligations (GOs) were a significant focus for
   the Trust. Secured by local property taxes, they are deemed very high quality
   debt. The Trust's investments included industry-based communities, as well as
   agricultural and tourism-based communities in central and northern Michigan.

- -  The Trust took advantage of its ability to add Puerto Rico bonds, which
   provided more issuer diversification and a more varied coupon mix. Puerto
   Rico investments included industrial development revenue bonds, general
   obligations, insured* transportation issues, electric utilities, special tax
   revenue bonds and lease revenue bonds.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   36.0% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the
   issuance of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an
   opportunity for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  The New Jersey economy continued to expand in 2004, with job creation seen
   across many industries. Job growth exceeded the national rate, with the
   strongest areas in construction, health care, state and local government and
   business services. The state's November 2004 jobless rate was 4.4%, down from
   5.5% a year ago and below the national rate.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds represented the Trust's largest sector
   weighting at November 30, 2004. Investments included bonds for port
   authorities, turn-pike authorities and other toll-backed facilities - all key
   segments of New Jersey's economic infrastructure.

- -  The Trust was selective within the hospital sector, given the industry's
   competitive and operating pressures. Management focused on issues of
   well-managed facilities with sound underlying fundamentals and good cost
   controls.

- -  Special tax revenue bonds were an emerging theme for the Trust. Investments
   included an issue backed by a state tax levied on the sale of cigarettes.
   Another such issue was a motor vehicle surcharge revenue bond, backed by
   "bad-driver" penalties.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  In 2004, the New York economy achieved its best employment growth since the
   2001 recession. Boosted by the service, construction and financial sectors,
   job creation in the New York City suburbs outpaced the upstate manufacturing
   areas. The state's November 2004 jobless rate was 4.9%, down from 6.3% a year
   ago.

- -  Electric utility bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at
   November 30, 2004. As essential services, utilities tend to enjoy a
   relatively stable revenue stream. The Trust's investments included the
   state's largest power authority - which has 17 power-generating facilities
   throughout the state - as well as local authorities serving Long Island.

- -  Education bonds were a significant focus of the Trust. Investments included
   local development bonds for facilities, as well as state dormitory issues
   that financed the construction and expansion of dorms, classrooms and lab
   facilities.

- -  The Trust remained very selective with respect to the hospital sector. The
   Trust focused its investments on a geographically diverse mix of acute care
   institutions across the state with sound finances, good cost controls and
   experienced management.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Ohio's economy continued to stabilize in 2004, as the pace of job loss eased.
   While the long-troubled manufacturing sector contracted further, the health
   care and educational sectors remained a strong source of new job creation.
   The state's November 2004 jobless rate was 6.5%, up from 6.1% a year ago.

- -  Hospital bonds were the Trust's largest weighting at November 30, 2004. The
   hospital industry has been under pressure to contain costs in response to
   competition and strict reimbursement policies. The Trust focused on
   institutions with strong fundamentals and in-demand health care specialties.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GOs) were a significant focus of the Trust.
   Investments included school district GOs, which are valued by investors in an
   economy in which there are lingering uncertainties about some industrial
   issuers.

- -  Industrial development revenue bonds (IDRs) constituted a large investment
   of the Trust. Management remained selective, focusing on one of the
   better-per-forming airlines, a large national brewer and beverage producer
   and the nation's largest auto manufacturer.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   35.6% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the
   issuance of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an
   opportunity for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special
   risks (including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and
   market price of common shares).

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND
ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE
PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. INVESTMENT RETURN AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR
LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME PERIOD ONLY;
DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE TRUST'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER
THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Pennsylvania's job situation improved in 2004, following three years of job
   losses. Employment gains were spread across a range of industries, including
   retail, business services, education, health care, leisure and tourism. The
   state's November 2004 jobless rate was 5.4%, up slightly from 5.2% a year
   ago.

- -  Insured* education bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at
   November 30, 2004. These issuers have enjoyed stable revenues despite the
   recent economic fluctuations and included issues from the Commonwealth's
   higher education system as well as some of its esteemed private universities.

- -  Insured* hospital bonds were prominent investments of the Trust. Holdings
   represented a geographically diverse mix and focused on institutions with
   good cost controls, experienced management and an attractive range of health
   care offerings.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GOs) were significant holdings for the Trust.
   With a slow recovery constraining tax revenue growth, the Trust focused on
   communities and school districts that management believed can maintain
   property values and stable revenues.

- -  At November 30, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   36.0% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust is leveraged through the
   issuance of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an
   opportunity for increased income, but, at the same time, creates special

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA AUDIT AND
     ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.012, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.012, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.36% to 7.44%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.68% to
     4.73%. Per-share data and ratios for the period prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(4)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(5)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(6)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA AUDIT AND
     ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.002, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.002, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.60% to 7.61%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.81% to
     4.82%. Per share data and ratios for the period prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(4)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(5)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(6)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA AUDIT AND
     ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.005, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.51% to 7.55%, and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.75% to
     4.77%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(4)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(5)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(6)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA AUDIT AND
     ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.002, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.002, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.62% to 7.64% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.83% to
     4.84%. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(3)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return is
     not computed on an annualized basis.

(4)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

(5)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(6)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA AUDIT AND
     ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES and began using the interest
     method to amortize premiums of fixed-income securities. The effect of this
     change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net investment
     income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and unrealized gains per
     share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net investment income to average net
     assets applicable to common shares from 7.45% to 7.48% and increase the
     ratio of net investment income to average total net assets from 4.67% to
     4.68%. Per-share data and ratios for the periods prior to December 1, 2001
     have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS as of November 30, 2004
NOTESTO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Eaton Vance California Municipal Income Trust (California Trust), Eaton Vance
Florida Municipal Income Trust (Florida Trust), Eaton Vance Massachusetts
Municipal Income Trust (Massachusetts Trust), Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal
Income Trust (Michigan Trust), Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income Trust
(New Jersey Trust), Eaton Vance New York Municipal Income Trust (New York
Trust), Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust (Ohio Trust), and Eaton Vance
Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (Pennsylvania Trust), (individually referred
to as the Trust or collectively the Trusts) are registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management
investment companies. The Trusts were organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated
December 10, 1998. Each Trust's investment objective is to provide current
income exempt from regular federal income taxes and taxes in its specified
state. Each Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in
investment grade municipal obligations issued by its specified state.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by each Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
between the latest bid and asked prices. Futures contracts and options on
futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement
prices. Over-the-counter options on futures contracts are normally valued at the
mean between the latest bid and asked prices. Short-term obligations, maturing
in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates value.
Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available
are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the
direction of the Trustees.

B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after the
transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market fluctuations
during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed delivery purchases
are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to segregate assets in a
separate account, with a current value at least equal to the amount of its
purchase commitments.

C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and tax-exempt
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore, no provision
for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At November 30, 2004, the Trusts,
for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss carryovers which will reduce
taxable income arising from future net realized gain on investments, if any, to
the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, and thus will reduce the
amount of the distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary
to relieve the Trusts of any liability for federal income or excise tax. The
amounts and expiration dates of the capital loss carryovers of each Trust are as
follows:

In addition, each Trust intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments in
municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes when
received by each Trust, as exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such
interest, if any, earned on private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986,
may be considered a tax preference item for investors.

E FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
contract, a Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
received by a Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for book
purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Trust. A Trust's investment in
financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against anticipated
future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should interest rates
move unexpectedly, a Trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

F OPTIONS ON FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option on
a financial futures contract by a Trust, the premium paid is recorded as an
investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
option expires, a Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
option. When a Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, a Trust will
realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing
sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option. When a Trust
exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk associated with
purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally paid.

G USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

H INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under each Trust's organizational documents, its officers
and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to each Trust and shareholders are
indemnified against personal liability for the obligations of each Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, each Trust enters into
agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. Each
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against each Trust that have not yet
occurred.

I EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
of the Trusts. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT receives a
fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
balances each Trust maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the
Trusts' custodian fees, if any, are reported as a reduction of total expenses in
the Statement of Operations.

2 AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

Each Trust issued Auction Preferred Shares on March 1, 1999 in a public
offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded as a
reduction of capital of the common shares of each Trust. Dividends on the APS,
which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the
offering of each Trust's APS and have been reset every seven days thereafter by
an auction.

Auction Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2004 and
dividend rate ranges for the year ended November 30, 2004 are as indicated
below:

The APS are redeemable at the option of each Trust at a redemption price equal
to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption
price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any
Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset maintenance requirements
with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in an
amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class
have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the
holders of the APS and the Common Shares have equal voting rights of one vote
per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a separate class, have the
right to elect at least two members of the Board of Trustees. The APS have a
liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. Each Trust is required to maintain certain asset coverage with
respect to the APS as defined in each Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company
Act of 1940. Each Trust pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred
shares liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the
preferred auction.

3 DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Each Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income, after
payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions of any
realized capital gains, if any, are made at least annually. Distributions to
preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred Shares
is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for Auction Preferred
Shares on November 30, 2004 are listed below. For the year ended November 30,
2004, the amount of dividends each Trust paid to Auction Preferred shareholders
and average APS dividend rates for such period were as follows:

</Table>

The Trusts distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and
profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of capital.
Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to distributions
are reclassified to paid in capital.

The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended November 30, 2004
and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Each Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk
in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures contracts
and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts
recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts
of these instruments represent the investment a Trust has in particular classes
of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts
potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these
instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are
considered.

A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at November 30, 2004
is as follows:

</Table>

At November 30, 2004, each Trust had sufficient cash and/or securities to
cover margin requirements on open future contracts.

9 OVERDRAFT ADVANCES

Pursuant to the custodian agreement between the Trusts and Investors Bank &
Trust (IBT), IBT may in its discretion advance funds to the Trusts to make
properly authorized payments. When such payments result in an overdraft by the
Trusts, the Trusts are obligated to repay the IBT at the current rate of
interest charged by IBT for secured loans (currently, a rate above the federal
funds rate). This obligation is payable on demand to IBT. At November 30, 2004,
New York Trust had payments due to IBT pursuant to the foregoing arrangement of
$9,226.

examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our

above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc., at
1-800-331-1710.

     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
     agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred

 (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its

specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is

specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately
pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services

investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.


Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the

</Table>

(1)  Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
     agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred
     shares.
(2)  Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
     rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax
     advice, and tax planning.

 (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal

specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is

specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately
pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services

(1)  Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the

registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.


Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

(1)  Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
     agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred
     shares.

including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is

specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately
pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.


Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.


Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
