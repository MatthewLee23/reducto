PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST

The Trust declared $0.45 of dividends during the fiscal year ended February 28,
2003. Based on the average month-end net asset value ("NAV") per share of $6.90,
this resulted in an annualized distribution rate of 6.4%(1) for the year. The
Trust's total return (based on NAV) for the fiscal year was 0.4%, reflective of
the difficult market conditions experienced during most of calendar 2002.

For the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2003, the Trust's annualized
distribution rate was 6.5%(1). The quarterly annualized distribution rate was
down slightly from the previous fiscal quarter 6.9% due primarily to improvement
in the average month-end NAV. During the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2003,
the Trust posted a 2.5% total market return, representing the second quarter of
significant sequential improvement.

A steady rise in underlying values, coupled with a generally healthier investor
sentiment towards floating rate senior loan funds since the beginning of the
year, has also had a decidedly positive impact on the Trust's common shares.
Total return based on market value (assuming full dividend reinvestment) was
11.3% for the three-month period ended February 28, 2003, versus -9.7% for the
S&P 500 Index. For the full fiscal year, the Trust's common shares returned 2.5%
(dividends reinvested), versus -22.7% for the S&P 500 Index.

The Trust's recent performance has been driven by a stronger overall tone to the
loan market, made manifest by generally rising indicative loan prices. Several
of the Trust's larger holdings benefited from credit-specific improvements. As
an example, Nextel Communications ("Nextel"), the Trust's largest single
position at period-end, accounting for approximately 4.1% of total assets,
continues to exceed analysts' operational and financial expectations, thereby
driving prices for the company's term loans to near-par levels. By way of its
bellwether standing, Nextel's string of success has also had a tangible positive
effect on prices across the cellular communications sector, historically one of
the Trust's largest.

Moreover, indicative pricing for term loans issued by Charter Communications
Operating LLC ("Charter"), the Trust's second largest individual holding
(roughly 2.6% of total assets at period-end), also improved during the fiscal
quarter. The average bid now lies several percentage points off a low reached
during the fourth quarter of 2002, and continues to slowly edge upward.
Consistently underpinned by stable valuation levels of cable television systems,
recent interest in Charter's term loans appears to have been driven by a renewed
investor confidence in the ability of cable television operators to both defend
and grow their higher margin subscriber base.

Also contributing to fiscal fourth quarter results was, again, consistent
performance across several of the Trust's other material sector concentrations
(e.g., Healthcare, Containers & Packaging and Beverage & Food), offset to a
degree by disappointing recoveries on a small number of existing non-performing
loans, particularly the Trust's older, illiquid positions. We continue to
dedicate significant time and resources in an effort to maximize recovery values
in this area, typically under very difficult circumstances.

The Trust utilizes financial leverage to seek to increase the yield to the
holders of common shares. As of February 28, 2003, the Trust had $617 million of
borrowings outstanding, consisting of $450 million of "aaa/AAA" rated cumulative
auction rate preferred shares, and $167 million outstanding under $540 million
in available credit facilities. Total leverage, as a percentage of total assets
(including preferred shares), was 39.9% at quarter end. The weighted average
leverage cost including all borrowings and preferred shares as of quarter ended
February 28, 2003 was 1.38%. While the use of leverage for investment purposes
increases both investment opportunity and investment risk, we continue to deploy
leverage only when it is in the best interest of the Trust's common
shareholders.

                                        2

OUTLOOK

In our view, the Trust, and the non-investment grade loan market at large,
appears to be reasonably well positioned to meet the expected challenges of the
coming months. Overall credit conditions continue to slowly improve, as
evidenced by another quarter-over-quarter decline in the trailing loan default
rate (by principal amount) for the industry to approximately 5.5%, after peaking
at 7.4% in June of last year.(2) Further, the supply of new transactions, an
important barometer of market health, has been fairly generous. Institutional
M&A-related loan volume closed out at $6.2 billion during the first quarter of
2003, the highest level since the first quarter of 2000.(2) Understandably, the
forward calendar looks less robust at this point, effectively capped by
uncertainty surrounding the outcome of military action in the Middle East.

Nonetheless, we maintain a cautious view of the economic outlook, both as it
appears today and once hostilities in Iraq come to an end. Several indicators,
not the least being a chronically anemic labor market, point to significantly
slower growth than originally anticipated. Whether such weakness is a
continuation of the unwinding of the excesses of the 1990s, or a by-product of
caution on the part of companies and consumers alike, remains to be seen. If
macro economic conditions were to deteriorate, it could further pressure a good
portion of the non-investment grade issuer universe and increase the prospects
for a further rate cut on the part of the Federal Reserve. An additional
reduction in already historically low short-term interest rates could continue
to depress returns, even if underlying loan values continue to rise. As stated
in our prior report, we will remain in a relatively defensive posture while
seeking to take advantage of selective buying opportunities.

We thank you for your investment in ING Prime Rate Trust.

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' FOOTNOTES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing dividends declared
     during the quarter and dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the
     Trust's average month-end net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the
     average month-end NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of Market). The
     distribution rate is based solely on the actual dividends and
     distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The
     distribution rate may or may not include all investment income and
     ordinarily will not include capital gains or losses, if any.

STATISTICS AND PERFORMANCE FOOTNOTES

(A)  Yield is calculated by dividing the Trust's net investment income per share
     for the most recent thirty days by the net asset value (in the case of NAV)
     or the NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of market) at quarter-end.
     Yield calculations do not include any commissions or sales charges, and are
     compounded for six months and annualized for a twelve-month period to
     derive the Trust's yield consistent with the SEC standardized yield formula
     for open-end investment companies.

(B)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing each monthly dividend,
     then averaging the annualized dividends declared for each month during the
     quarter and dividing the resulting average annualized dividend amount by
     the Trust's average net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE
     Composite closing price (in the case of Market) at the end of the period.

(C)  Calculation of total return assumes a hypothetical initial investment at
     the net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE Composite closing
     price (in the case of Market) on the last business day before the first day
     of the stated period, with all dividends and distributions reinvested at
     the actual reinvestment price.

(D)  On December 27, 1994, the Trust issued to its shareholders transferable
     rights which entitled the holders to subscribe for 17,958,766 shares of the
     Trust's common stock at the rate of one share of common stock for each four
     rights held. On January 27, 1995, the offering expired and was fully
     subscribed. The Trust issued 17,958,766 shares of its common stock to
     exercising rights holders at a subscription price of $8.12. Offering costs
     of $4,470,955 were charged against the offering proceeds.

(E)  On October 18, 1996, the Trust issued to its shareholders non-transferable
     rights which entitled the holders to subscribe for 18,122,963 shares of the
     Trust's common stock at the rate of one share of common stock for each five
     rights held. On November 12, 1996, the offering expired and was fully
     subscribed. The Trust issued 18,122,963 shares of its common stock to
     exercising rights holders at a subscription price of $9.09. Offering costs
     of $6,972,203 were charged against the offering proceeds.

(F)  Inception Date -- May 12, 1988.

(G)  Initial Trading on NYSE -- March 9, 1992.

(H)  Reflects partial waiver of fees.

ADDITIONAL NOTES AND INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT PROGRAM

The Trust offers a Shareholder Investment Program (the "Program," formerly known
as the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan) which allows holders of the
Trust's common shares a simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional common shares of the Trust. The Program
also offers holders of the Trust's common shares the ability to make optional
cash investments in any amount from $100 to $5,000 on a monthly basis. Amounts
in excess of $5,000 require prior approval of the Trust. DST Systems, Inc., the
Trust's Transfer Agent, is the administrator for the Program.

For dividend reinvestment purposes, DST Systems, Inc. will purchase shares of
the Trust on the open market when the market price plus estimated commissions is
less than the net asset value on the valuation date. The Trust may issue new
shares when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued at the
greater of (i) net asset value or (ii) the market price of the shares during the
pricing period, minus a discount of 5%.

For optional cash investments, shares will be purchased on the open market by
the DST Systems, Inc. when the market price plus estimated commissions is less
than the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued by the
Trust when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date.

There is no charge to participate in the Program. Participants may elect to
discontinue participation in the Program at any time. Participants will share,
on a pro-rata basis, in the fees or expenses of any shares acquired in the open
market.

Participation in the Program is not automatic. If you would like to receive more
information about the Program or if you desire to participate, please contact
your broker or our Shareholder Services Department at (800) 992-0180.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees

ING Prime Rate Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of the ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust") as of
February 28, 2003, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the years in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of investments owned as of February 28, 2003 by
confirmation with the custodian and other appropriate auditing procedures. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
ING Prime Rate Trust as of February 28, 2003 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the years in the two-year period then ended, and financial highlights
for each of the years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of February 28, 2003

NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust"), is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, closed-end,
investment management company. The Trust invests in senior loans which are
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the "`33
Act"), but contain certain restrictions on resale and cannot be sold publicly.
These loans bear interest (unless otherwise noted) at rates that float
periodically at a margin above the Prime Rate of a U.S. bank specified in the
credit agreement, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), the certificate
of deposit rate, or in some cases another base lending rate. The following is a
summary of the significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

A.   SENIOR LOAN AND OTHER SECURITY VALUATION. Loans are normally valued at the
     mean of the means of one or more bid and asked quotations obtained from a
     pricing service or other sources determined by the Board of Trustees to be
     independent and believed to be reliable. Loans for which reliable
     quotations are not available may be valued with reference to another loan
     or a group of loans for which quotations are more readily available and
     whose characteristics are comparable to the loan being valued. Under this
     approach, the comparable loan or loans serve as a proxy for changes in
     value. The Trust has engaged an independent pricing service to provide
     quotations from dealers in loans and to calculate values under the proxy
     procedure described above. As of February 28, 2003, 91.8% of total
     investments were valued based on these procedures. It is expected that most
     of the loans held by the Trust will be valued with reference to quotations
     from the independent pricing service or with reference to the proxy
     procedure described above.

     Prices from a pricing source may not be available for all loans and ING
     Investments, LLC (the "Investment Manager") may believe that the price for
     a loan derived from market quotations or the proxy procedure described
     above is not reliable or accurate. Among other reasons, this may be the
     result of information about a particular loan or borrower known to the
     Investment Manager that the Investment Manager believes may not be known to
     the pricing service or reflected in a price quote. In this event, the loan
     is valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
     established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance with the
     provisions of the 1940 Act. Under these procedures, fair value is
     determined by the Investment Manager and monitored by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees through its Valuation Committee. In fair valuing a loan,
     consideration is given to several factors, which may include, among others,
     the following: (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data
     relating to the loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate,
     period until the next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate
     of the loan, the terms and conditions of the loan and any related
     agreements, and the position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure;
     (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the
     Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral;
     (iii) the creditworthiness of the borrower and the cash flow coverage of
     outstanding principal and interest, based on an evaluation of its financial
     condition, financial statements and information about the borrower's
     business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv)
     information relating to the market for the loan, including price quotations
     for, and trading in, the loan and interests in similar loans; (v) the
     reputation and financial condition of the agent for the loan and any
     intermediate participants in the loan; (vi) the borrower's management; and
     (vii) the general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value
     of the loan. Securities for which the primary market is a national
     securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System are stated at the
     last reported sale price on the day of valuation. Debt and equity
     securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
     which no sale was reported on that date are valued at the mean between the
     last reported bid and asked price. Securities other than senior loans for
     which reliable quotations are not readily available and all other assets
     will be valued at their respective fair

                                       16

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of February 28, 2003 (Continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     values as determined in good faith by, or under procedures established by,
     the Board of Trustees of the Trust. Investments in securities maturing in
     less than 60 days from the date of acquisition are valued at amortized
     cost, which, when combined with accrued interest, approximates market
     value.

B.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. It is the Trust's policy to comply with the
     requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to "regulated
     investment companies" and to distribute all of its taxable income to its
     shareholders. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.
     In addition, by distributing during each calendar year substantially all of
     its net investment income and net realized capital gains (if any), the
     Trust intends not to be subject to any federal excise tax.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. Loans are booked on a
     settlement date basis and security transactions are accounted for on trade
     date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains or losses
     are reported on the basis of identified cost of securities delivered.
     Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
     recorded on an accrual basis at the then-current interest rate of the loan.
     The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of
     management, there is an indication that the borrower may be unable to meet
     payments as they become due. Upon such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued
     interest is reversed. Cash collections on nonaccrual senior loans are
     generally applied as a reduction to the recorded investment of the loan.
     Senior loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due amounts
     have been received and the borrower has demonstrated sustained performance.
     For all loans acquired prior to March 1, 2001, arrangement fees, which
     represent non-refundable fees associated with the acquisition of loans, are
     deferred and recognized over the shorter of 2.5 years or the actual terms
     of the loan. For all loans, except revolving credit facilities, acquired
     subsequent to February 28, 2001, arrangement fees are treated as discounts
     and accreted as described in Note 1.H. Arrangement fees associated with
     revolving credit facilities acquired subsequent to February 28, 2001 are
     deferred and recognized over the shorter of 4 years or the actual term of
     the loan.

D.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. The Trust records distributions to
     its shareholders on the ex-dividend date. Distributions from income are
     declared by the Trust on a monthly basis. Distributions from capital gains,
     if any, are declared on an annual basis.

E.   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENTS. Pursuant to the Shareholder Investment Program
     (formerly known as the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan), DST Systems,
     Inc., the Plan Agent, purchases, from time to time, shares of beneficial
     interest of the Trust on the open market to satisfy dividend reinvestments.
     Such shares are purchased only when the closing sale or bid price plus
     commission is less than the net asset value per share of the stock on the
     valuation date. If the market price plus commissions is equal to or exceeds
     the net asset value, new shares are issued at the greater of (i) net asset
     value or (ii) the market price of the shares during the pricing period,
     minus a discount of 5%.

F.   USE OF ESTIMATES. Management of the Trust has made certain estimates and
     assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
     expenses and contingencies to prepare these financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States of America. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

G.   SHARE OFFERINGS. During the year ended February 28, 1999, the Trust began
     issuing shares under various shelf registration statements, whereby the net
     proceeds received by the Trust from share sales may not be less than the
     greater of (i) the NAV per share or (ii) 94% of the average daily market
     price over the relevant pricing period.

H.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. In November 2000 the American Institute of
     Certified Public Accountants (the "AICPA") issued a revised version of the
     AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the "Guide").
     Effective March 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the Guide and
     began amortizing premiums and accreting discounts on debt securities. Prior
     to March 1, 2001, the Trust had not amortized premiums nor accreted
     discounts. The cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on
     net assets of the Trust, but resulted in a $3,653,000 increase in the cost
     of securities and a corresponding $3,653,000 increase in net unrealized
     depreciation of investments, based on securities held by the Trust on March
     1, 2001.

I.   RECLASSIFICATION. Under EITF Topic D-98, CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF
     REDEEMABLE SECURITIES, which was issued on July 19, 2001, preferred
     securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
     classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is
     at a fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon
     the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the
     issuer. Subject to the guidance of the EITF, the Trust's preferred stock,
     which was previously classified as a component of net assets, has been
     reclassified outside of permanent equity (net assets) in the accompanying
     financial statements. Prior year amounts have also been reclassified to
     conform with this presentation. The impact of this reclassification creates
     no change to the net assets available to common shareholders.

NOTE 2 -- INVESTMENTS

For the year ended February 28, 2003, the cost of purchases and the proceeds
from principal repayment and sales of investments, excluding short-term notes,
totaled $764,209,674 and $880,505,551, respectively. At February 28, 2003, the
Trust held senior loans valued at $1,476,322,899 representing 96.1% of its total
investments. The market value of these assets is established as set forth in
Note 1.

The senior loans acquired by the Trust may take the form of a direct lending
relationship with the borrower, an assignment of a lender's interest in a loan,
or a participation interest in a lender's interest in a loan. The lead lender in
a typical corporate loan syndicate administers the loan and monitors collateral.
In the event that the lead lender becomes insolvent, enters FDIC receivership
or, if not FDIC insured, enters into bankruptcy, the Trust may incur certain
costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or
interest. Additionally, certain situations may arise where the Trust acquires a
participation in a lender's interest in a loan and the Trust does not have
privity with or direct recourse against the borrower. Accordingly, the Trust may
incur additional credit risk as a participant because it must assume the risk of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the lender from which the participation was
acquired.

Common and preferred shares, and stock purchase warrants held in the portfolio
were acquired in conjunction with senior loans held by the Trust. Certain of
these stocks and warrants are restricted and may not be publicly sold without
registration under the '33 Act, or without an exemption under the '33 Act. In
some cases, these restrictions expire after a designated period of time after
issuance of the shares or warrant.

NOTE 5 -- RIGHTS AND OTHER OFFERINGS

As of February 28, 2003, share offerings pursuant to shelf registrations were as
follows:

                 REGISTRATION        SHARES           SHARES
                     DATE          REGISTERED       REMAINING

                   3/04/99          5,000,000        3,241,645

On November 2, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares each of Series M, Series W
and Series F Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $270 million. Also, on November
16, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares of Series T and Series Th Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000, liquidation preference,
for a total issuance of $180 million. Costs associated with the offering of
approximately $5,438,664 were charged against the proceeds received. The Trust
used the net proceeds of the offering to partially pay down the then existing
indebtedness. The Trust may reborrow amounts in the future to increase its use
of leverage which will be consistent with the limitations imposed by the 1940
Act. Preferred Shares pay dividends based on a rate set at auctions, normally
held every 7 days. In most instances dividends are also payable every 7 days, on
the first business day following the end of the rate period.

NOTE 6 -- CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT

State Street Bank and Trust Company ("SSB") serves as the Trust's custodian and
recordkeeper. Custody fees paid to SSB are reduced by earnings credits based on
the cash balances held by SSB for the Trust. There were no earnings credits for
the year ended February 28, 2003.

NOTE 7 -- SUBORDINATED LOANS AND UNSECURED LOANS

The primary risk arising from investing in subordinated loans or in unsecured
loans is the potential loss in the event of default by the issuer of the loans.
The Trust may acquire a subordinated loan only if, at the time of acquisition,
it acquires or holds a Senior Loan from the same borrower. The Trust will
acquire unsecured loans only where the Investment Manager believes, at the time
of acquisition, that the Trust would have the right to payment upon default that
is not subordinate to any other creditor. The Trust may invest up to 5% of its
total assets, measured at the time of investment, in subordinated loans and
unsecured loans. As of February 28, 2003, the Trust held 3.6% of its total
assets in subordinated loans and unsecured loans.

NOTE 8 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Dividends paid by the Trust from net investment income and distributions of net
realized short-term capital gains (if any) are, for federal income tax purposes,
taxable as ordinary income to shareholders. The tax composition of dividends and
distributions to common shareholders for years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002
were as follows:

               ORDINARY         LONG-TERM        TAX RETURN
                INCOME        CAPITAL GAINS      OF CAPITAL

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of February 28, 2003 (Continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of distributions from net investments income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These "book/tax"
differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. Key
differences are the treatment of short-term capital gains, amortization of
discounts and other temporary differences. To the extent that these differences
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts based on their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do
not require reclassifications. To the extent distributions exceed net investment
income and/or net realized capital gains for tax purposes, they are reported as
distributions of paid-in capital.

Accordingly, the following amounts represent current year permanent tax
differences that have been reclassified as of February 28, 2003:

                                             ACCUMULATED NET

            MANAGEMENT'S ADDITIONAL OPERATING INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

APPROVAL OF CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

At a Special Meeting of Trust Shareholders, held August 6, 1998, Shareholders
approved changes in the Trust's fundamental investment policies which make
available certain additional investment opportunities to the Trust, including
(i) investing in loans in any form of business entity, as long as the loans
otherwise meet the Trust's requirements regarding the quality of loans in which
it may invest; (ii) the treatment of lease participations as Senior Loans which
would constitute part of the 80% of the Trust's assets normally invested in
Senior Loans; (iii) investing in all types of hybrid loans that meet credit
standards established by the Investment Manager constituting part of the 20% of
the Trust's assets that may be invested in Other Investments; and (iv) the
ability to invest up to 5% of its total assets in both subordinated loans and
unsecured loans which would constitute part of the 20% of the Trust's assets
that may be invested in Other Investments.

Additionally, another policy change approved by the Board of Trustees of the
Trust, which does not require shareholder approval, permits the Trust to accept
guarantees and expanded forms of intangible assets as collateral, including
copyrights, patent rights, franchise value, and trademarks. Another policy
change approved by the Board, that does not require shareholder approval,
provides that 80% of the Trust's managed assets, as opposed to 80% of its net
assets, may normally be invested in Senior Loans.

The Trust's Manager considered the evolving nature of the syndicated loan market
and the potential benefits to the Trust and its shareholders of revising the
restriction to permit the Trust to invest in loans other than Senior Loans and
the increase in the number of attractive investment opportunities available to
the Trust due to the change.

REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END COMPANIES

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 23c-1 under the 1940
Act the Trust may from time to time purchase shares of beneficial interest of
the Trust in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions and/or
purchase shares to correct erroneous transactions.

SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT PROGRAM

The Trust offers a Shareholder Investment Program (the "Program") which enables
investors to conveniently add to their holdings at reduced costs. Should you
desire further information concerning this Program, please contact the
Shareholder Servicing Agent at (800) 992-0180.

NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS

The approximate number of record holders of Common Stock as of March 31, 2003
was 8,100, which does not include approximately 48,100 beneficial owners of
shares held in the name of brokers of other nominees.
