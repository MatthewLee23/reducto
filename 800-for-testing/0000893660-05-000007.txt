Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.pioneerfunds.com for the most recent month-end
performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV is total assets less total liabilities, which includes
preferred shares, divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at market price.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is designed
to mirror the investible universe of the $US-denominated leveraged loan market.
As of March 30, 2001, the Index included $148 billion in tradable term loans.
Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. You
cannot invest directly in an Index.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/05
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first shareholder report for Pioneer Floating Rate Trust covers the period
since the Trust's inception on December 23, 2004, through May 31, 2005. In the
report, portfolio managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital
Management LP discuss the investment process, strategy and outlook.

Q:  How did the Trust perform during the period?

A:   Since inception on December 23, 2004 through May 31, 2005, Pioneer Floating
     Rate Trust returned 0.63% at net asset value and -10.55% at market price.
     From December 31, 2004, through May 31, 2005, the Trust's benchmark, the
     Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) Leveraged Loan Index, returned 1.79%. At
     the end of May, the Trust was selling at a discount of market price to net
     asset value of -6.73%. The Trust's net asset value return reflects the
     expenses associated with the start-up costs of the Trust, including
     payments made in connection with the issuance of preferred shares in March.
     From the end of December 2004 through May 2005, the Federal funds target
     rate rose 0.75%. During the same period, the yield on the Three-Month
     London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR)rose from 2.56% to 3.34%. LIBOR
     stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate is and the rate of interest
     at which banks borrow funds from other banks, in marketable size, in the
     London Interbank market.

Q:  What were the principal strategies used in managing the Trust?

A:  In keeping with the Trust's mandate, we invested over 80% of assets in
    senior floating-rate loans (senior loans). Senior loans are extensions of
    credit made by a bank or other lender to a company, typically secured by
    the assets of the borrower. Historically, senior loans have offered higher
    yields than short-term Treasury securities. They also have greater risk.
    Senior loans generally pay interest at rates that are based on recognized
    lending rates, such as LIBOR, plus a premium. Rates on senior loans reset
    regularly to maintain a spread over these widely accepted floating base
    rates. At the end of the period, the Trust had about 11% in
    higher-yielding second lien loans and other types of floating-rate debt
    securities. Finally, we had a relatively small allocation, about 2%, in
    high-yield bonds. During the period, the yield curve began to flatten
    (short-term yields rose and longer-term yields declined). Historically, a
    flattening yield curve has been a precursor to a slowing economy. In this
    environment, investors became more risk-averse and tended to shift from
    lower-quality investments,

                                                                               5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/05                            (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    such as high-yield bonds, to higher-quality investments. As a result,
    prices on lower-quality securities declined, and our relatively low
    allocation to such securities proved to be beneficial.

    We diversified the Trust among more than 200 issuers in approximately 30
    industries. The top five industries represented in the Trust were cable,
    telecommunications, housing, gaming and leisure and utilities. At the end
    of the period, the credit quality breakdown of the portfolio was as
    follows: BBB (2%), BB (19%), B (58%), CCC (7%) and not-rated (14%).

Q:  What was the investment environment like for senior loans during the period?


A:   The market environment was mixed during the period, as senior loans enjoyed
     strong demand in the face of continued interest senior-rate hikes by the
     Federal Reserve Bank. Lower default rates may also have been instrumental
     in boosting investor interest in loans. The short duration of loan funds,
     which can reduce interest-rate risk in fixed-income portfolios, was also
     attractive to investors. (Expressed in years, duration measures a fund's
     price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A shorter duration is
     usually advantageous when interest rates rise.)

     During 2004, loan funds experienced record inflows of assets. As a result,
     the average credit spread (or premium) over LIBOR contracted as tracked by
     the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, from 286 basis points on December 31, 2004
     to 268 basis points on May 31, 2005. Despite this narrowing, the spread
     contraction for senior loans has been less pronounced than that in other
     fixed-income asset classes, such as high-yield bonds.

     In late March, as a result of various market technicals, the average
     secondary market senior loan price began to drop. This trend appears to
     have reversed itself for the most part. Therefore, while asset values
     declined slightly for what appears to be technical reasons, the situation
     provided us with an opportunity to purchase additional assets at attractive
     prices for the Trust.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:  What is your outlook?

A:   Relative to other asset classes, we believe that bank loans should continue
     to provide an attractive risk/return trade-off and an effective
     diversification vehicle. Historically, bank senior loans have produced
     positive long-term total returns for shareholders with significantly less
     volatility than other asset classes. We are currently in a rising
     interest-rate environment and believe the Fed is likely to continue
     boosting interest rates at a measured pace over the next several months.
     History has shown that the bank senior loans, as an asset class, have held
     up well during periods of rising interest rates.

    *    Senior secured floating rate loan interests in which the Trust
         invests generally pay interest at rates that are periodically
         redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a premium.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/05 (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware business
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 23, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the sale and issuance
to Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc., an affiliate of Pioneer Investment
Management, Inc. ("PIM"), the Trust's investment adviser, a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano S.p.A. (UniCredito Italiano), of
5,240 shares of beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,084.
PIM has agreed to pay all the Trust's organizational expenses and to pay the
amount by which the aggregate offering costs (other than the sales load) exceed
$0.04 per share of the common share offering. The investment objective of the
Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary goal of high current income.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The
Trust may invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality,
including Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment
grade, or are unrated but are determined by the investment subadviser to be of
equivalent credit quality, commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
considered speculative. These securities involve greater risk of loss, are
subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid, especially during
periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust

26
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with those
generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior Loans are
    valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of Trustees.
    Senior Loans are valued at the mean between the last available bid and
    asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan
    Pricing Corporation. For the limited number of Senior Loans for which no
    reliable price quotes are available, such Senior Loans will be valued by
    Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of pricing matrices to determine
    valuations. If the pricing service does not provide a value for the Senior
    Loans, the investment subadviser will value the Senior Loans at fair
    value, which is intended to approximate market value.

    Fixed income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
    pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
    maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and
    other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued at the last sale
    price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Securities for
    which quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair values
    as determined by, or under the direction of, the Board of Trustees.
    Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at
    various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such
    securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are
    determined as of such times. The Trust may also use the fair value of a
    security, including a non U.S. security, when the closing market price on
    the principal exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately
    reflects the value of the security as of the close of the exchange. As of
    May 31, 2005, the Trust had no fair valued securities. Temporary cash
    investments are valued at amortized cost.

    Discount and premium on debt securities are accreted or amortized daily,
    respectively, on an effective yield to maturity basis and are included in
    interest income. Premiums and discounts related to certain mortgage-backed
    securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the underlying
    paydowns. Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash
    accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis.

                                                                              27
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/05      (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Trust's investments in foreign markets or countries with limited
    developing markets may subject the Trust to greater degree of risk than in
    a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
    conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
    currency exchange restrictions.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
    among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
    contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between
    the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.  Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
    distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if
    any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
    required.

    The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
    financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
    income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may
    be shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in
    excess of net investment income or net realized gain on investment
    transactions, or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax
    differences that may exist.

    The tax character of current year distributions paid will be determined at
    the end of the current fiscal year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
    received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
    excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. PIM is responsible for
    determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
    repurchase price.

E.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
    Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
    dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
    full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash.
    Shareowners may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not
    participating in the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary
    and may be terminated or resumed at any time by notifying Mellon Investor
    Services LLC, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the
    "Plan Agent"), prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
    termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any
    subsequently declared dividend or other distribution. Whenever the Trust
    declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash, participants in the
    Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares acquired by the Plan
    Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized
    common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common
    shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment
    date for any dividend the net asset value per common share is equal to or
    less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees
    ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in
    newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
    credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount
    of the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the
    shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
    current market price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common
    share is greater than the market value

                                                                              29

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/05      (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ("market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in
    common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage
    charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However, each
    participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
    with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in
    the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local
    taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners
    holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the
    shares to another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

The Trust has entered into an advisory agreement with PIM. Management fees are
calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily value of the Trust's
total assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which liabilities
exclude debt related to leverage, short-term debt and the aggregate liquidation
preference of any outstanding preferred shares. At May 31, 2005, $447,945 was
payable to PIM related to management fees.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. For the
year period ended May 31, 2005, the Trust recorded $13,986 as "Administrative
reimbursements" on the Statement of Operations.

The adviser has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment subadviser ("Subadviser") and manage the Trust's investments. Under
the terms of the subadvisory agreement, for its services, the Subadviser is
entitled to a subadvisory fee from PIM at an annual rate of 0.35% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. The fee will be paid monthly in arrears.
The Trust does not pay a fee to the Subadviser.

30
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Trust has entered into an administration agreement with the Adviser,
pursuant to which the Adviser will provide certain administrative and
accounting services to the Trust. The Adviser has appointed Princeton
Administrators, L.P. ("Princeton") as the sub-administrator to the Trust to
perform certain of the Adviser's administration and accounting obligations to
the Trust. Under the administration agreement, the Trust pays the Adviser a
monthly fee equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average daily managed assets up to
$500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in excess of $500
million. The Adviser and not the Trust, is responsible for paying the fees of
Princeton, which is affiliated with Merrill, Lynch & Co.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations to limit the Trust's total annual expenses [excluding offering costs
for common and preferred shares, interest expense, the cost of defending or
prosecuting any claim or litigation to which the Trust is a party (together
with any amount in judgment or settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes
incurred due to the failure of the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Code or any other non-recurring or non-operating expenses] to
0.95% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. The dividend on any
preferred shares is not an expense for this purpose. For the period ended May
31, 2005, the Trust's expenses were not reduced under such arrangements.

3. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into any contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by
entering into an offsetting hedge contract. At May 31, 2005, the Trust had no
outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

                                                                              31

Offering costs of $973,000 incurred in connection with the Trust's
offering of common shares have been charged to paid-in capital.

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. On
March 28, 2005, the Trust reclassified and issued 9,380 common shares into
three series of AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series W7-3,125 and Series
TH7-3,125. Offering costs of $351,729 and underwriting discounts of $2,345,000
have been charged to paid-in capital.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates
ranged from 3.00% to 3.35% during the period ended May 31, 2005.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Agreement and
Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

                                                                              33

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/05      (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required
to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the
preferred shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders,
including, among other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a
closed-end investment company or changes in its fundamental investment
restrictions.

7. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to May 31, 2005, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.0958 per common share
payable June 30, 2005, to common shareowners of record on June 15, 2005.

For the period June 1, 2005 to June 30, 2005, dividends declared on preferred
stock totaled $650,329 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share
series.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (unaudited)
During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's
investment objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which have not been
approved by the shareowners. There have been no changes in the principal risk
factors associated with investment in the Trust. There have been no changes in
the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the
Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(C) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its common
shares in the open market.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

    N/A

(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The Fund's independent auditor, Ernst & Young
LLP ("E&Y"), has advised the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, and the Audit
Committee of the Fund's Board of Trustees that
certain non-audit work performed by E&Y's China
affiliate raised questions regarding E&Y's
independence with respect to its performance of
audit services for the Fund.  In July 2004, E&Y
became aware that member firms in China ("E&Y
China") provided certain tax services to offices of
UniCredito Italiano, S.p.A. ("UCI"), a member of
the Fund's Investment Company Complex.  The
services included receipt and disbursement of
monies transferred to E&Y China by UCI in
payment of individual expatriate income taxes due
on returns prepared by E&Y China for certain UCI
employees located in China from October 1998 to
May 2003.  E&Y became auditors of the Fund in
May 2002.  These expatriate tax services were
discontinued in May 2003.  The fees received by
E&Y China for all such services totaled $3,685.

The Fund's Audit Committee and E&Y have
discussed the matter, including the nature of the
services provided, the personnel involved in
providing the services and the fees received by
E&Y for performing the services.  E&Y has informed
the Audit Committee that based on its internal reviews
and the de minimis nature of the services provided and
fees received, it does not believe its independence
with respect to the Fund has been impaired.

N/A


(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

N/A


ITEMS 5-6. [RESERVED]


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual report on

describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote

principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

N/A


ITEM 8. [RESERVED]


ITEM 9. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing
similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded, that the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective based on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

There were no significant changes in the registrant's internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to
the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard
to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.


ITEM 10. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
