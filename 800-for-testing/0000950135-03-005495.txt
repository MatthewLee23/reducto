    CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders:

We are pleased to present the Annual Report of The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2003. During this period, the
Fund's net asset value ("NAV") increased by 13.35% in U.S. dollar terms and by
13.10% in New Taiwan ("NT") dollar terms. During the same period, the Taiwan
Stock Exchange Index (the "TAIEX") increased by 18.59% in NT dollar terms. The
NT dollar appreciated over the U.S. dollar by 0.23% during this period.

On August 31, 2003, the Fund's shares were trading at US$11.09 per share,
reflecting a discount of 13.49% to the Fund's NAV per share of US$12.82. The
Fund's shares were trading at a discount of 18.04% on August 31, 2002.

The global economy advanced in the second quarter of 2003, encouraged by a quick
ending of the war between the U.S. and Iraq. Confidence was rebuilt after the
war, and economic growth has resumed on the back of increased spending and
investments. U.S. real GDP growth, for example, accelerated to 3.1% in the
second quarter of 2003 from 1.4% in the first quarter. It is expected that the
global economy should keep growing in the second half of 2003 and even through
2004 with the help of record-low interest rates and continued government
stimuli. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy should
grow 4.1% in real terms in 2004 following 2003's projected 3.2%. In the
foreseeable future, the global economic outlook appears to be positive with
optimism rising steadily, albeit slowly.

Taiwan's economy dipped in the second quarter of 2003 before catching up with
the global economy later in the year. In fact, most Asian countries suffered a
sudden setback in economic activity during the second quarter of 2003, as the
outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) slowed consumer spending.
According to the Taiwan Directorate General of Budget Accounting and Statistics,
Taiwan's real GDP contracted 0.08% in the second quarter of 2003, compared to a
growth of 3.53% in the first quarter. However, the impact of SARS proved to be
short-lived. Taiwan's real GDP growth rate is now expected to increase to 3.96%
in the third quarter of 2003, and to rise to 4.67% in the fourth quarter. Export
growth should continue to lead the way due to robust demand from the U.S. as
well as China. Domestic demand should also recover as the housing market
improves due to lower interest rates. Taiwan's economy is now poised to follow
the global economy and should continue expanding.

Over the longer-term, however, the global economy must overcome some headwinds
to move forward at full speed. The most important one is the economy's inability
to generate jobs. The slack in the

 2
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

economy may turn out to be so large that more time will be required to restore a
balance between aggregate supply and demand. This means that current economic
growth may not be sustainable, and a cyclical down-cycle may loom as soon as in
2004.

Another issue is the Chinese economy. It is likely that the fast growing Chinese
economy will need to slow down to avoid an investment-led bubble which would
dampen the country's long-term prospects. Foreign investments have been one of
the key factors contributing to China's growth. The Chinese government is
concerned about the amount of money flowing into the nation, especially since
speculation on Renminbi appreciation has further contributed to unstable short-
term liquidity that may adversely affect its economy. Several measures to cool
off excess investment flows, particularly in the property sector, were adopted
by the government, including a symbolic action by the central bank to increase
the reserve requirement. This may put pressure on the economic recovery of other
countries that rely on China's economy. Taiwan, in particular, may suffer a
fairly severe impact because of its close ties to China.

In August 2003, City of London Investment Group PLC and City of London
Investment Management Company Limited (together, "City of London"), which we
believe together constitute the Fund's largest shareholder, filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission a statement on Schedule 13D regarding the
Fund. In the Schedule 13D, City of London expressed concern regarding the
under-performance of the Fund's net asset value compared to its benchmark, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (the "TAIEX") and the number of changes that have
taken place in the position of Fund portfolio manager during the past several
years. The Fund's Board of Directors recognizes that the under-performance of
the Fund compared to the TAIEX and the portfolio manager changes are of concern
to shareholders. The Board shares this concern and has been reviewing and
continues to review a number of alternatives to address these issues and thereby
to enhance shareholder value. The Board will keep shareholders advised of its
progress towards addressing these important issues.

We believe that with Taiwan's underlying strength the Fund will remain
competitive on a global basis. We appreciate your continued support.

Sincerely,

/s/ S.Y. Wang

S. Y. Wang

                                                                               3

    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") increased by 13.35% in U.S. dollar terms and
by 13.10% in New Taiwan ("NT") dollar terms during the fiscal year ended August
31, 2003. The Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (the "TAIEX") increased by 18.59% in
NT dollar terms during the same period. The Fund underperformed the TAIEX in the
first half of the fiscal year, but later recovered to outperform the TAIEX in
the second half of the fiscal year. Relative to other investment funds which the
Fund considers its peers, the Fund has achieved superior performance for the
past year ranking it in first place on a twelve-month basis.

We attribute our improving performance to our heavy exposure in the technology
sector, which outperformed the TAIEX from February to August. We re-adjusted our
investment focus to overweight the technology sector in May in time to benefit
from this sector's rally since that time. Our decision to stay underweight in
the finance sector also proved correct, as this sector underperformed the TAIEX
significantly from May to July. Although our performance in the first six months
of Fiscal Year 2003 was adversely affected in January when various domestic
sectors unexpectedly surged, we were able to recoup our underperformance
gradually for the remaining part of the year.

To better enhance portfolio returns with managed risk exposure, we have
gradually increased the degree of concentration in our active portfolio by
focusing on only a few companies which we expect to outperform our TAIEX
benchmark over time. The number of stocks in the active portfolio, as a result
of this initiative, was reduced from 79 at the end of August 2002 to 46 at the
end of February 2003. We further reduced the number of stocks to 25 during May
2003, as we believed such degree of concentration was appropriate given the fact
that we already had a well-diversified core portfolio accounting for 60% of the
Fund's NAV. We intend to keep this level of concentration in the active
portfolio for the foreseeable future.

INVESTMENT OUTLOOK

Last year, we were optimistic about the market, as we believed the global
economy should gradually bottom out on better confidence, recovering consumer
spending, increasing business investments, and an improving job market. We saw
the market bottom out and make a strong rally from the second quarter of 2003.
But there is still one missing aspect: the creation of jobs.

In the U.S. for example, private non-farm payrolls were down by about 1.3
million since the U.S. economy passed its official trough some 21 months ago.
This is inconsistent with historical recovery patterns, which would predict an
increase of more than 2 million jobs at the current stage, according to Morgan
Stanley. This shortfall of new jobs represents a serious issue for the economic
recovery.

On a more bullish note, however, we believe our cautious economic view should be
placed in the context of a favorable market environment characterized by ample
liquidity and rising cyclical demand in the near term. In particular, the
still-pending inventory cycle may emerge to become a major catalyst for
continued economic growth in the next six months. As we have indicated in our
semi-annual report, businesses have been keeping such lean inventories that they
may turn out to be insufficient once demand picks up. The U.S.
inventory-to-sales ratio plunged to record low of 1.37 months in July. As low
interest rates and government stimuli continue to support consumer spending, it
is increasingly likely that businesses may soon begin re-stocking their
inventories, contributing to further economic growth into 2004.

We expect the Taiwan stock market to trend up in the near-term, driven by
improving prospects and ample liquidity. Strong export growth is anticipated in
the second half of 2003, in line with seasonal strengths. More encouragingly,
domestic demand is improving as evidenced by the recovering property sector, in
which stocks have on average risen about 49% so far in 2003. In terms of
liquidity, a

                                                                               5
<PAGE>

    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

continued stream of money due to positive factors such as low interest rates and
increasing foreign investment interest has helped support the market. The
liquidity from abroad, much of it representing funds invested to track the
Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc. ("MSCI") index, is especially worth
noting because of its scale. Many foreign investors have come to believe that
MSCI is likely to announce the lifting of Taiwan's limited investability factor
("LIF") in its November review in response to the government's decision to
abolish the QFII system by the end of October. Although it is expected that MSCI
will not raise the LIF to a full 100% from the current 55% and the
implementation may occur in two stages, liquidity has already flowed to take
positions while stock prices are relatively low. We estimate that US$2 billion
will flow into Taiwan as a result of the MSCI adjustment, providing strong
support for the market ahead of the actual implementation in 2004.

Another source of liquidity comes from currency exchange. We believe the NT
dollar is set for further appreciation over the US dollar in 2004. As a result,
people are exchanging US dollars for NT dollars to avoid potential currency
losses. The amount of such liquidity (on-shore foreign exchange deposits) has
remained stable at around NT$1 trillion to NT$1.2 trillion since 2001. This
liquidity should result in "asset reflation" in 2004, which should support
domestic demand and benefit related sectors.

China-related opportunities should continue to attract investors in 2004, but
caution is warranted. Momentum may be slowing in various sectors, including both
domestic and export-oriented sectors.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We will continue to focus on the investment themes we have repeatedly stressed
in our previous reports, including Outsourcing Winner, China Harvest, and New
Product. But we will also be watching closely the impact of upcoming issues such
as NT dollar appreciation and China's slowing growth. It is becoming more
important to do bottom-up rather than top-down analysis, because of the mixed
macro economic outlook. Strategically, we will be extremely price sensitive in
buying companies that may be affected by these issues. We will also be looking
for opportunities resulting from asset reflation plays in related sectors. In
general, we expect the market to trend up by the end of 2003 and consolidate in
early 2004. The market for the second half of 2004 will depend on whether the
global economy develops a more balanced source of growth; i.e., domestic demand
in countries other than the U.S.

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the theme of Outsourcing Winner, we will concentrate on the technology
sector with investments in notebook PC manufacturers, handset manufacturers, IC
foundry and packaging. The replacement effect in the PC industry has favored
notebook suppliers in 2003 and we expect such a trend to continue in 2004.
Global unit shipments of notebook PC's are expected to grow over 20% in 2004,
following a similar growth rate in 2003. A leading cost-effective producer of
notebook PC's, Taiwan should see larger growth than the market in general, as
related companies continue to gain market share. For handset manufacturers, the
investment rationale is the same: market share gains in a growing industry that
is commoditizing. In the area of IC foundries and packaging, the reasons are
somewhat different. The increasing outsourcing trend in this segment is driven
by companies' strong competence in process technology for IC fabrication. We
believe investing in such companies should consistently provide better
performance in the long run.

For the theme of China Harvest, we will spread our risks among various sectors
benefiting from continued growth in domestic demand. Our previous focus on the
auto sector has been scaled down due to increased competition and slowed market
momentum. Cyclical plays in commodities, basic materials, and transportation are
still attractive, but we think valuations will become rich in 2004 as the
current cycle is expected to peak in 2005. Therefore, we will pay more attention
to consumer non-cyclical plays in sectors such as food and beverage. We believe
there are still plenty of growth opportunities in China-related plays, and the
theme of China Harvest should continue to be a significant focus.

Our New Product theme will focus on TFT-LCD (thin film transistor-liquid crystal
display) and DVD (digital versatile disc) related companies. The proliferation
of TFT-LCD products is perhaps the most exciting development in the technology
sector in recent years. Driven by increasing adoption in monitors and TVs, the
TFT-LCD sector has grown to become a large industry in Taiwan comparable in
significance to the semiconductor sector. It is projected that global TFT-LCD TV
shipments should grow from around 4 million units in 2003 to more than 30
million units by 2006 as prices come down. Supply in this sector, in terms of
TFT-LCD panel production, is constrained by technology hurdles and the limited
number of manufacturers. The thriving DVD market should also experience
continued growth, as the high-quality digital media offered by related products
becomes a necessity in everyday life. We expect companies in the supply chain of
DVD players, DVD drives, or DVD recorders to outperform the market as the
industry's growth extends into 2004. Other areas of interest within the New

                                                                               7
<PAGE>

    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product theme include DSC (digital still camera) and next-generation handset
(color/camera embedded 3G phone), but both of these are less attractive due to
intensified competition and mounting inventory levels.

The big picture in the finance sector, which would benefit from asset reflation,
is improving noticeably with banks cleaning up their non-performing loans during
the past few years. Commercial loan growth may combine with consumer loan growth
and help stimulate financial sector shares. A favorable interest rate outlook
and supportive government policy, also support positive market sentiment.
Valuation is another attractive feature for financial sector shares, which were
trading at around 1.4X book value at the end of August 2003. This is a
relatively low figure compared to the overall market's 1.8X and this sector's
own average of 3.4X for the past ten years. We expect to build up more positions
in the finance sector as conditions improve.

In conclusion, we expect to maintain a balanced portfolio in the year ahead to
take advantage of these various themes. Our investment outlook, though cautious
in the mid-term, is rather optimistic as we are confident in Taiwan's long-term
positive prospects given its proven strengths in global competition.

Thank you for your support of the Fund and we look forward to discussing our
strategy again in coming reports.

Sincerely,

    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a Delaware corporation, is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end management investment company.

The Fund is not permitted to invest directly in the securities of Republic of
China ("ROC") companies. Therefore, it invests through a contractual securities
investment trust fund arrangement. This arrangement was established by means of
the Securities Investment Trust, Investment Management and Custodian Contract
("Management Contract") among HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Limited
("Adviser"), the International Commercial Bank of China (Custodian) and the
Fund. Under the Management Contract the Adviser manages and invests the assets
of the Fund and the Custodian holds the assets. The Fund is the sole beneficiary
of the assets held under the Management Contract and, as required by ROC
regulations, its interest in the assets is evidenced by units of beneficial
interest.

The Fund concentrates its investments in the securities listed on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange. Because of this concentration, the Fund may be subject to
additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in
Taiwan and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws of currency
exchange restrictions affecting Taiwan.

The policies described below are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Security Valuation.  All securities, including those traded over-the-counter,
for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sales
price prior to the time of determination of the Fund's net asset value per share
or, if there were no sales on such date, at the closing price quoted for such
securities (but if bid and asked quotations are available, at the mean between
the last current bid and asked prices, rather than such quoted closing price).
In certain instances where the price determined above may not represent fair
market value, the value is determined in such manner as the Board of Directors
may prescribe. Short-term investments, having a maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, with accrued interest
or discount earned included in interest receivable.

Repurchase Agreements.  In connection with transactions in repurchase
agreements, it is the Fund's policy that its custodian take possession of the
underlying collateral securities, the fair value of which exceeds the principal
amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest, at all times.
If the seller defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

Foreign Currency Translation.  The financial accounting records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate. Purchases and sales of securities, income receipts and
expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
dates of the transactions.

Reported net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from disposition of foreign currencies, currency
gains and losses realized between the trade dates and settlement dates of
security transactions, and the difference between the amount of net investment
income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are not
segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of changes in market
prices of those securities, but are included in realized and unrealized gain or
loss on investments in securities.

Forward Foreign Currency Transactions.  A forward foreign currency contract
("Forward") is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell currency at a set
price on a future

                                                                              17

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

date. The Fund may enter into Forwards in order to hedge foreign currency risk
or for other risk management purposes. Realized gains or losses on Forwards
include net gains or losses on contracts that have matured or which the Fund has
terminated by entering into an offsetting closing transaction. Unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of Forwards is included in the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities and is carried on a net basis. The portfolio could be exposed to
risk of loss if the counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract or
if the value of the currency changes unfavorably. As of August 31, 2003 the Fund
had no open Forwards.

Taxes.  As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent
that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains for its fiscal year. In addition to federal income tax
for which the Fund is liable on undistributed amounts, the Fund is subject to
federal excise tax on undistributed investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains. The Schedule of Investments includes information
regarding income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information." The Fund is
organized in Delaware and as such is required to pay Delaware an annual
franchise tax. Also, the Fund is currently subject to a Taiwan security
transaction tax of 0.3% on equities and 0.1% on mutual fund shares of the
transaction amount.

The Fund's functional currency for tax reporting purposes is the New Taiwan
dollar.

Investment Income.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except
where the ex-dividend date may have passed; certain dividends from foreign
securities are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date.

Taiwanese companies typically declare dividends in the Fund's third fiscal
quarter of each year. As a result, the Fund receives substantially less dividend
income in the first half of its year. Interest income, which includes accretion
of original discount, is accrued as earned.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received.

Distributions to Shareholders.  The distributable income from the assets held
under the Management Contract, which is limited to cash dividends and interest
income received, may be distributed to the Fund only once in each year at the
Fund's discretion and is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized capital
gains and stock dividends may also be distributed to the Fund. Within the above
limitations the Fund will, under current ROC regulations, be able to remit out
of the ROC the proceeds of income and capital gains distributions, unit
redemptions and other distributions of assets held under the Management
Contract.

The Fund distributes to shareholders at least annually, substantially all of its
taxable ordinary income and expects to distribute its taxable net realized
gains. Certain foreign currency gains (losses) are taxable as ordinary income
and, therefore, increase (decrease) taxable ordinary income available for
distribution. Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"), shareholders may elect to have all distributions automatically
reinvested in Fund shares. (See the summary of the Plan.) Shareholders who do
not participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check
in U.S. dollars. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to differing
treatments for foreign currency transactions, losses deferred due to wash sales
and excise tax regulations. Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to
shareholder distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.

    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Security Transactions.  Security transactions are accounted for as of the trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

2. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2003, cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $246,213,287
and $248,240,289, respectively.

3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Management Fee.  As the Fund's investment adviser, HSBC receives a fee that is
computed daily at an annual rate of 1.30% of the Fund's average net assets. The
basic fee is subject to a performance adjustment (up to a maximum of + or
- -0.30%) based on the Fund's investment performance as compared to the Taiwan
Stock Exchange Index over a rolling 36-month period.

For the year ended August 31, 2003, the management fee, including the
performance adjustments, was equivalent to an annual rate of 1.09% of average
net assets.

Directors Fees.  No director, officer or employee of the Adviser or its
affiliates will receive any compensation from the Fund for serving as an officer
or director of the Fund. The Fund pays each of its directors who is not a
director, officer or employee of the Adviser an annual fee of $10,000 plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or Audit Committee meeting attended,
and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone. In addition, the Fund will
reimburse each of the directors for travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with Board of Directors' meetings.

Administration Fees.  State Street Corporation ("State Street") provides, or
arranges for the provision of certain administrative and accounting services for
the Fund, including maintaining the books and records of the Fund, and preparing
certain reports and other documents required by federal and/or state laws and
regulations. The Fund pays State Street a fee at the annual rate of 0.11% of the
Fund's average daily net assets up to $150 million, 0.08% of the next $150
million, and 0.05% of those assets in excess of $300 million, subject to certain
minimum requirements.

4. FUND SHARES

At August 31, 2003, there were 20,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value capital
stock authorized, of which 16,365,572 were issued and outstanding.

5. DISTRIBUTIONS

The Fund did not pay any distributions to shareholders during the year ended
August 31, 2003. As of August 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings
on a tax basis were $0 of Undistributed Ordinary Income, $0 of Undistributed
Long-Term Capital Gain, $60,074,022 of Unrealized Appreciation and ($92,368,907)
of accumulated capital and other losses.

The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash
sales.

                                                                              19

    INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
THE TAIWAN FUND, INC.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc., including the Fund's investments, as of August 31, 2003, and
the related statement of operations for the year then ended, and statements of
changes in net assets for each of the years in the two-year period then ended
and financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period then
ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. The financial highlights for each of the years in the two-year period
ended August 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated October
12, 2000, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of August 31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2003, the results of its operations for the
year ended, and the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended and financial highlights for each of the years in the
three-year period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN?

The Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") offers
shareholders of The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") a prompt and simple way to
reinvest their dividends and capital gains distributions in shares of the Fund.
The Fund will distribute to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all
of its net income and expects to distribute annually its net realized capital
gains. Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. ("Equiserve" or the "Plan Administrator"),
a federally chartered trust institution, acts as Plan Administrator for
shareholders in administering the Plan. The Plan also allows you to make
optional cash investments in Fund shares through the Plan Administrator.

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN?

If you own shares in your own name, you can elect to participate directly in the
Plan. If you own shares that are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or
other nominee, you should contact your nominee to arrange for them to
participate on your behalf.

WHAT DOES THE PLAN OFFER?

The Plan has two components; reinvestment of dividends and capital gains
distributions, and a voluntary cash purchase feature.

REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS DISTRIBUTIONS

If you choose to participate in the Plan, your dividends and capital gains
distributions will be promptly invested for you, automatically increasing your
holdings in the Fund. If the Fund declares a dividend or capital gains
distribution payable in cash, you will automatically receive shares purchased by
the Plan Administrator on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open
market.

If a distribution is declared which is payable in shares or cash at the option
of the shareholder and if on the valuation date (generally the payable date) the
market price of shares is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, the Fund
will issue new shares to you at the greater of the following: (a) net asset
value per share or (b) 95% of the market price per share. If the market price
per share on the valuation date is less than the net asset value per share, the
Fund will issue new shares to you at the market price per share on the valuation
date.

All reinvestments are in full and fractional shares, carried to three decimal
places. In the case of foreign (non-U.S.) shareholders, reinvestment will be
made net of applicable withholding tax.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE OPTION

Plan participants have the option of making investments in Fund shares through
the Plan Administrator. You may invest any amount from $100 to $3,000
semi-annually. The Plan Administrator will purchase shares for you on the New
York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market on or about February 15 and
August 15. If you hold shares in your own name, you should deal directly with
the Plan Administrator. We suggest you send your check to the following address
to be received on or about February 5 or August 5 to allow time for processing:
Equiserve, c/o The Taiwan Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010. The Plan Administrator will return any cash payments received more
than thirty days prior to February 15 or August 15, and you will not receive
interest on uninvested cash payments. If you own shares that are held in the
name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your
nominee to arrange for them to participate in the cash purchase option on your
behalf.

<PAGE>
    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IS THERE A COST TO PARTICIPATE?

Each participant will pay a pro rata portion of brokerage commissions payable
with respect to purchases of shares by the Plan Administrator on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market. Otherwise, there is no charge to
participants for reinvesting dividends and capital gains distributions, since
the Plan Administrator's fees are paid by the Fund. Brokerage charges for
purchasing shares through the Plan are expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charges for individual transactions, because the Plan Administrator
will purchase stock for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower
commissions for each individual participant.

For purchases from voluntary cash payments, participants are charged a service
fee of $.75 for each investment and a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.

Brokerage commissions and service fees, if any, will be deducted from amounts to
be invested.

WHAT ARE THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS?

You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to help
you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

If the Fund issues shares upon reinvestment of a dividend or capital gains
distribution, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount reportable in
respect of the reinvested amount of the dividend or distribution will be the
fair market value of the shares received as of the payment date, which will be
reportable as ordinary dividend income and/or long term capital gains. The
shares will have a tax basis equal to such fair market value, and the holding
period for the shares will begin on the day after the payment date. State, local
and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PLAN, MAY I WITHDRAW FROM IT?

You may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written notice to
the Plan Administrator.

If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in
your name for all full shares, or, if you wish, the Plan Administrator will sell
your shares and send you the proceeds, less a service fee of $2.50 and less
brokerage commissions. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares
you hold at the time of your withdrawal to cash at the current market price and
send you a check for the proceeds.

WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION?

If you hold shares in your own name, please address all notices, correspondence,
questions, or other communications regarding the Plan to: Equiserve, c/o The
Taiwan Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, 1-800-426-5523.
If your shares are not held in your name, you should contact your brokerage
firm, bank, or other nominee for more information and to arrange for them to
participate in the Plan on your behalf.

Either the Fund or the Plan Agent may amend or terminate the Plan. Except in the
case of amendments necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, rules
or policies or a regulatory authority, participants will be mailed written
notice at least 90 days before the effective date of any amendment. In the case
of termination, participants will be mailed written notice at least 90 days
before the record date of any dividend or capital gains distribution by the
Fund.

                                                                              23

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                         AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
         applies to the Fund's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
         President and Treasurer (or persons performing similar functions)
         ("Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

         -        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         -        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to,
                  the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other
                  public communications made by the Fund;

         -        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         -        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -        accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. The Fund will expect all Covered
Officers to comply at all times with the principles in this Code. A violation of
this Code by an employee is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including
discharge and possible legal prosecution. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of
Directors ( the "Audit Committee").

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his
position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. The compliance
programs and procedures of the Fund and HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Ltd., the
Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or identify
and correct, violations of these provisions. Certain conflicts of interest also
arise out of the personal securities trading activities

                                       1
<PAGE>

of the Covered Officers and the possibility that they may use information
regarding the Fund's securities trading activities for their personal benefit.
The Fund's Code of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act is
designed to address these conflicts of interest. This Code does not, and is not
intended to, replace these programs and procedures or the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code
of Ethics, and this Code's provisions should be viewed as being additional and
supplemental to such programs, procedures and code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will,
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is consistent with
the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by other codes.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

         -        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; and

         -        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
material business affiliations outside the Fund and must update the report
annually.

         Covered Officers should avoid situations which involve the appearance
of, or potential for, conflicts of interest. Examples of these situations
include:

         -        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets to theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment, provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         -        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser or any affiliated person thereof;
                  and

         -        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

         In situations involving a Covered Officer which involve the appearance
of, or the potential for, conflicts of interest, but where the Covered Officer
believes that no significant conflict of interest exist, the Covered Officer
must obtain prior written approval from the Audit Committee before becoming
involved in that situation. No such approval shall be considered a waiver of
this Code.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
                  disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to
                  the Fund;

         -        each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or
                  cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  directors and auditors, or to governmental regulators and
                  self-regulatory organizations;

         -        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Fund and the Adviser with the goal of
                  promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
                  disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with,
                  or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
                  by the Fund; and

         -        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -        upon adoption of the Code or (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         -        annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         -        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                  employee of the Fund or their affiliated persons for reports
                  of potential violations that are made in good faith; and

                                       3
<PAGE>

         -        notify the Audit Committee promptly if he knows of any
                  violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
                  of this Code.

         The Audit Committee is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any waivers sought by a Covered
Officer must be considered by the Audit Committee.

         A copy of this Code shall be delivered to each employee of the Fund and
each employee of the Adviser annually together with a memorandum requesting that
any violations of the Code be communicated immediately to the Audit Committee.

         The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -        the Audit Committee will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to it;

         -        if, after such investigation, the Audit Committee believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the Audit Committee is not
                  required to take any further action;

         -        if the Audit Committee determines that a violation has
                  occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or a
                  recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

         -        the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         -        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       CHANGES TO OR WAIVERS OF THE CODE

         No change to or waiver of any provision of this Code will be effective
until the Fund discloses the nature of any amendment to, or waiver from, a
provision of the Code in its Form N-CSR, or on its website within five business
days following the date of the amendment or waiver if this method of disclosure
has been established in its Form N-CSR and made available on its website for

extent required by the rules of the SEC and by any applicable rules of any

                     HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                              As of August 1, 2003

<PAGE>

                     HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

         HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Limited (the "Advisor") is an investment
advisor registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that serves
as the investment manager for the Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") pursuant to a
Securities Investment Trust-Investment Management and Custodian Contract dated
August 22, 2001 (the "Management Contract") among the Fund, the Advisor and the
International Commercial Bank of China, the Fund's Taiwan custodian.

         Under the Taiwan Regulations Governing Securities Investment Trust Fund
Enterprises (the "SITE Regulations") and the Taiwan Rules Governing the Use of
Proxies for Attendance at Shareholder Meetings of Public Companies (the "Proxy
Rules"), the Advisor has the responsibility for exercising voting rights
("Voting Rights") on the shares of Taiwan companies held under the Management
Contract, and the Fund has delegated to the Advisor the duty to exercise Voting
Rights with respect to such shares. Under the SITE Regulations and the Proxy
Rules, the Advisor must exercise the Voting Rights on behalf of the Fund in a
manner which is in the best interests of the Fund; provided that the Advisor is
required to vote in favor of proposals made or candidates for director or
supervisor nominated by the Board of Directors of the company issuing the shares
which are being voted (the "Issuing Company") unless the Advisor determines that
there is unsound management of the Issuing Company which may cause damage to the
interests of the Issuing Company or its shareholders ("Unsound Management"). If
the Advisor determines that there is Unsound Management with respect to an the
Issuing Company, the SITE Regulations and the Proxy Rules require that the
shares at issue be voted in accordance with a resolution of the Board of
Directors of the Advisor.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         Under the U.S. Investment Advisors Act of 1940, the Advisor is a
fiduciary that owes the Fund a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all
services it undertakes on the Fund's behalf, including exercising Voting Rights.
The Advisor is therefore subject to a fiduciary duty, within the confines of
applicable Taiwan law, to exercise Voting Rights in a manner the Advisor
believes is consistent with the Fund's best interests. In fulfilling its
obligations to the Fund, the Advisor will seek to act in a manner that it
believes is most likely to enhance the economic value of the underlying
securities held for the Fund under the Management Contract.

Proxy Voting Committee

         In light of these fiduciary duties, and given the complexity of the
issues that may arise in connection with the exercise of Voting Rights, the
Advisor has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") to address issues
on behalf of the Advisor relating to the exercise of Voting Rights.

Scope of Committee Responsibilities

         The Committee shall have responsibility for determining how to exercise
Voting Rights. In doing so, the Committee will seek to ensure that Voting Rights
are exercised in the best interests of the Fund, and that Voting Rights are
exercised in a manner free from unwarranted influences.

         The Committee shall also establish the Advisor policies with respect to
Voting Rights, with such advice, participation and research as the Committee
deems appropriate from Portfolio Managers or other knowledgeable interested
parties. The Committee shall be responsible for determining how the Voting
Rights policies will be applied to specific votes, in light of each Issuing
Company's unique structure, management, strategic options and probable economic
consequences of alternative actions.

                                       3
<PAGE>

         In view of the requirements of Taiwan law with respect to the exercise
of Voting Rights, the Committee's primary focus will be on determining whether
or not voting in favor of proposals made by an Issuing Company's Board of
Directors or management are consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting in
favor of such a proposal (or a proposal supported by the Issuing Company's Board
of Directors) is consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will cause the Advisor to exercise the Voting Rights
in favor of the proposal following applicable Taiwan legal and voting
procedures. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting shares
in favor of a proposal is clearly not in the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will present the matter to the Board of Directors of
the Advisor in a timely manner with a recommendation that the Board of Directors
adopt a resolution authorizing the Advisor to vote against the proposal based on
the fact that the proposal reflects Unsound Management. The Advisor believes
that any circumstance where the Board of Directors or management of an Issuing
Company makes or supports a proposal submitted to a shareholder vote which is
clearly not in the best interests of shareholders reflects Unsound Management.

         The Committee will adopt policies with respect to recurring shareholder
voting matters, such as the election of directors and supervisors, which it
generally will follow with respect to these recurring matters and which are
attached to these voting guidelines. The Committee may, however, determine that
the subject matter of a proposal is not suitable for general voting guidelines
and requires a case-by-case determination. The Advisor believes that certain
Voting Rights issues require investment analysis - such as approval of mergers
and other significant corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and
are therefore not suitable for general guidelines.

         Pursuant to Article 44 of the SITE Regulations, prior to voting at a
shareholder meeting of an Issuing Company in which the Fund holds shares, the
Committee will prepare a written

                                       4
<PAGE>

report describing the assessment and analysis process used in determining how to
exercise the Voting Rights. In addition, if Voting Rights are exercised pursuant
to a resolution of the Advisor's Board of Directors, a written report of the
exercise of Voting Rights will be submitted to the Board after the shareholder
meeting.

         The Committee shall obtain copies of shareholder meeting notifications
and attendance cards and shall retain a written record of the exercise of Voting
Rights by the Advisor and the results of the voting. This record shall be kept
in consecutive order in files which shall be maintained for at least five years
after the shareholder meeting.

Committee Membership

         The Committee will be chaired by the Chief Investment Officer of the
Advisor responsible for the investment of the Fund's securities. The Committee
shall also include the deputy portfolio manager for the Fund, the Advisor's
senior compliance officer and such other personnel with investment and/or
relevant experience as the Chief Investment Officer deems appropriate. No
employee of the Advisor whose responsibilities relate primarily to marketing or
sales, and no person with any investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or
research responsibilities for the Advisor's affiliates may serve as a member of
the Committee or participate in its decision-making.

Circumstances Involving Conflicts of Interest

         In circumstances where the exercise of Voting Rights involves an actual
or apparent conflict of interest involving the Advisor or any of the Advisor's
affiliates, the decision regarding the exercise of Voting Rights will be made
exclusively by members of the Committee who have no personal involvement with or
relationship to the matter which produces the conflict of interest. For example,
if an Issuing Company is an investment advisory client of the Advisor, no
individual associated with the Advisor who has any relationship or involvement
with providing

                                       5
<PAGE>

advisory services to the Issuing Company shall participate in the decision with
respect to the exercise of those Voting Rights.

                                       6
<PAGE>

                                 VOTING POLICIES

         The Committee will analyze each exercise of Voting Rights individually.
The Committee has adopted the following voting guidelines, which represent the
Committee's usual voting position on certain recurring Voting Rights issues that
do not involve unusual circumstances. With respect to any Voting Rights issue,
however, the Committee may vote differently than a voting guideline if the
Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Fund.

         (a)   Board of Directors

         The Committee's general policy is to vote for nominees for director in
uncontested elections, except for nominees which have demonstrably poor records
of representing shareholder interests.

         (b)   Auditors

         The Committee's general policy is to vote for approval of independent
auditors, except for

         -        Auditors that have a financial interest in, or material
                  association with, the Issuing Company they are auditing, and
                  are therefore believed not to be independent.

         -        Auditors who have rendered an opinion to any company which is
                  either not consistent with best accounting practices or
                  indicative of the company's financial situation.

         (c)   Compensation and Benefits

         The Committee's general policy is to recommend a vote against proposals
regarding compensation and benefits for senior executive officers and directors
of issuing companies which are clearly in excess of levels of compensation and
benefits provided typically by Taiwan companies in similar circumstances.
