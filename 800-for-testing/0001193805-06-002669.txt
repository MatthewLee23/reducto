A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      Our commitment to providing shareholders with an attractive level of
income continued to drive portfolio activity, allowing the Fund to maintain an
above-average distribution rate throughout the fiscal year.

Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Long-term bond yields rose throughout most of the past year before declining in
August as bond prices correspondingly improved. The shift in direction was
largely a reaction to the Federal Reserve Board's (the Fed) decision on August 8
to refrain from raising the federal funds target rate. After 17 consecutive
interest rate hikes since mid-2004, a moderation in economic growth and decline
in inflationary expectations were cited as reasons for the Fed's pause. Earlier
in the 12-month period, bond yields rose steadily (and their prices fell) as
investors focused on solid economic growth in the United States and abroad.
Despite a decline in gross domestic product growth between the first and second
quarters of 2006, U.S. economic activity so far this year has outpaced the 3.2%
annual growth rate posted in 2005. Rising commodity prices also stoked
inflationary fears, further weighing on bond prices.

Overall, 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields rose 62 basis points (.62%) during
the 12-month period to 4.88%, while 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields rose 72
basis points to 4.74%. The yield curve continued to flatten as short-term
interest rates rose more than longer-term interest rates. Municipal bond yields
also rose, although the tax-exempt market's strong technical position provided
price support and allowed municipal bond prices to decline less than those of
taxable bonds. As measured by Municipal Market Data, yields on AAA-rated
municipal issues maturing in 30 years rose just four basis points to 4.26%,
while yields on AAA-rated issues maturing in 10 years rose 28 basis points to
3.78%.

The rise in yields prompted a revival in investor demand for municipal bonds.
The increased demand also was triggered by seasonal factors that served to
generate large cash flows into investor accounts. Investors received more than
$40 billion in June and July from coupon income and the proceeds from bond
maturities and early redemptions. Consequently, municipal bond fund flows
continued to be supportive. As reported by the Investment Company Institute,
open-end tax-exempt bond funds received net new cash inflows of over $6.8
billion in the first seven months of 2006, compared to $4.2 billion during the
same period in 2005.

Also contributing to the outperformance of the municipal market has been
declines in new issuance. During the past six months, more than $195 billion in
new long-term tax-exempt bonds was underwritten, a 10% decline compared to the
same period a year earlier. Recent declines in issuance have largely been the
result of a 56% drop in refunding activity so far this year. Rising bond yields
have made the refinancing of existing higher-couponed debt issues increasingly
problematic, as the potential economic savings have rapidly diminished. In
addition, the improved fiscal condition of many state and local governments has
resulted in lower borrowing trends, with many new municipal capital projects
financed from existing budget surpluses. The declines in issuance have led many
analysts to lower their annual issuance forecasts. Lower annual issuance would
further solidify the tax-exempt market's already positive technical position.

Looking ahead, municipal market fundamentals are likely to remain favorable,
leading us to expect the tax-exempt market to perform at least as well as
comparable U.S. Treasury issues. Attractive yield ratios have continued to draw
both retail and institutional investors to the municipal market. Based on this,
and the prospect for reduced annual issuance in 2006, we believe the municipal
market should continue to perform well in the coming months.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended August 31, 2006, the Common Stock of MuniVest
Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 5.92% and 6.09%, based on a year-end per
share net asset value of $9.93 and a per share market price of $9.66,
respectively, and $.588 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the
total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +3.27%, based on a change
in per share net asset value from $10.23 to $9.93, and assuming reinvestment of
all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, lagged the +4.13% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the
12-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit rating categories. These funds can be
leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase
agreements.) The Fund's underperformance resulted partly from our premature
positioning for an improving bond market. (This involved maintaining an

<PAGE>

interest rate sensitivity above that of our peers.) We expected the Fed to stop
raising interest rates by mid-2006 and, coincident with such a pause, for bond
price appreciation to ensue prior to August.

Perhaps more importantly, Fund performance was negatively impacted by our
exposure to the intermediate sector of the tax-exempt yield curve, an area that
lagged as the curve flattened. Over time, many of the Fund's holdings are
prerefunded to shorter call dates, while other issues are priced to shorter and
shorter call dates. This resulted in an increased exposure to intermediate
maturities (10 years or less), which have been particularly sensitive to the
increase in interest rates. Nevertheless, we chose to maintain the Fund's
exposure to intermediate bonds given their relatively high acquisition yields.
The sale of these bonds would result in both a material decline in the Fund's
distribution yield and significant taxable capital gains. On the positive side,
these credits allowed the Fund to maintain an above-average distribution yield.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2006, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +2.36%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $9.99 to $9.93, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the American Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Declines in new-issue volume and low nominal market yields served to limit
portfolio activity during the past year. In general, new purchases have been
focused on issues rated A or higher, particularly those in California and New
York, where greater issuance has made it easier to obtain attractively priced
bonds. We recently added some A-rated hospital bonds to the portfolio, which
provide both a generous level of coupon income and liquidity.

The Fund's overall credit quality improved during the year. At period-end, 72.7%
of the Fund was rated A or higher, compared to 70.7% on August 31, 2005. In
addition, 95.3% of the portfolio was rated BBB or higher at period-end compared
to 96% a year ago.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2006, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock (AMPS) had average yields as follows: Series A, 3.27%; Series B,
3.44%; Series C, 3.48%; Series D, 3.34%; Series E, 3.33%; and Series F, 3.42%.
The Fed raised short-term interest rates seven times during the 12-month period,
and this had an associated impact on the Fund's borrowing costs. Since the Fed
opted not to raise interest rates in August, the Fund's borrowing costs have
stabilized and moved slightly lower. Despite the interest rate increases during
the period, the municipal yield curve remained positively sloped and continued
to generate an income benefit to the Common Stock shareholder from the
leveraging of Preferred Stock. However, should the spread between short-term and
long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leverage will decline and, as a
result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At period-end, the Fund's
leverage amount, due to AMPS, was 35.38% of total net assets. (For a more
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 6 of this
report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We maintain a constructive view on the municipal market. The end of the Fed's
two-year interest rate-hiking campaign, combined with modest economic growth and
inflationary pressures, should promote a gradual improvement in tax-exempt bond
prices. Should we see signs of accelerated economic activity and/or rising wage
pressures, we would take steps to return to a more defensive positioning.

Overall, the Fund will remain fully invested in order to enhance the level of
income provided to shareholders. Portfolio activity in the months ahead will
likely be driven by our efforts to maintain an attractive yield.

<PAGE>

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield
and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be
achieved in all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues
Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates,
and invests the proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on
these investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings
is reflected in the per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock.
However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be
positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than
long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally declining
interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of these
conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh the
benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of August 31, 2006, the percentage of the Fund's
total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 12.08%, before the deduction
of Preferred Stock.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations
to pay the other party to the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

On September 29, 2006, MuniVest Fund, Inc. was renamed BlackRock MuniVest Fund,
Inc. (the "Fund"). The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price
in the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general direction
of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures contracts
and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing
prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are
valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the
case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation is the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements are
valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund's pricing service.
Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value, under which method the
investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount is amortized on a
straight line basis to maturity. Investments in open-end investment companies
are valued at their net asset value each business day. Securities and other
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such financial futures contracts.
      Financial futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of
      securities at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield.
      Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and maintains as
      collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the
      transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
      receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
      fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
      as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
      losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time
      it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
      Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
      is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the
      liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market
      value of the option written. When a security is purchased or sold through
      an exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added
      to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
      (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires
      (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain
      or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or
      gain or loss to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the
      premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.


16      BLACKROCK MUNIVEST FUND, INC.                    AUGUST 31, 2006
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts
      in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments
      on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set
      period of time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The
      net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate;
      the change in market value of a specified security, basket of securities,
      or index; or the return generated by a security. These periodic payments
      received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of
      Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are
      also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are
      marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Recent accounting pronouncement -- In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") entitled
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109." FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax
position must meet in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax
positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity including mutual funds
before being measured and recognized in the financial statements. Adoption of
FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

(e) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(f) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(g) Offering costs -- Direct expenses relating to the public offering of the
Fund's Preferred Stock were charged to capital.

(h) Reclassifications -- U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. There were no significant
reclassifications in the current year. These reclassifications have no effect on
net assets or net asset values per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at
an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average daily net assets, including assets
acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. The Investment Adviser has agreed to
reimburse its management fee by the amount of management fees the Fund pays to
FAM indirectly through its investment in the Merrill Lynch Institutional
Tax-Exempt Fund. For the year ended August 31, 2006, FAM reimbursed the Fund in
the amount of $9,280.

In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S")
received $2,750 in commissions on the execution of portfolio security
transactions for the Fund for the year ended August 31, 2006.

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

For the year ended August 31, 2006, the Fund reimbursed FAM $22,121 for certain
accounting services.

In February 2006, ML & Co. and BlackRock, Inc. entered into an agreement to
contribute ML & Co.'s investment management business, including FAM, to the
investment management business of BlackRock, Inc. The transaction will close on
September 29, 2006.

On August 15, 2006, shareholders of the Fund approved a new Investment Advisory
Agreement with BlackRock Advisors, Inc. (the "Manager"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock, Inc. was reorganized into BlackRock
Advisors, LLC. The new advisory agreement will become effective on September 29,
2006 and the investment advisory fee is unchanged. In addition, the Manager has
entered into a sub-advisory agreement with BlackRock Financial Management, LLC,
an affiliate, under which the Manager pays the Sub-Adviser for services it
provides a fee equal to 59% of the management fee paid to the Manager.

During the year ended August 31, 2006, certain officers and/or directors of the
Fund are officers and/or directors of FAM, PSI, and/or ML & Co.

3. Investments:

*     On August 31, 2006, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $15,459,706, all of which expires in 2009. This amount will be available
      to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized gains is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales and the
      tax deferral of losses on straddles.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets, including the schedule
of investments, of BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. (formerly MuniVest Fund, Inc.)
as of August 31, 2006, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of August 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2006, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

Disclosure of New Investment Advisory Agreement

New BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement -- Matters Considered by the Board

In connection with the combination of Merrill Lynch's investment advisory
business, including Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the "Previous Investment
Adviser"), with that of BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") to create a new
independent company ("New BlackRock") (the "Transaction"), the Fund's Board of
Directors considered and approved a new investment advisory agreement (the
"BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement") between the Fund and BlackRock
Advisors, LLC ("BlackRock Advisors"). The Fund's shareholders subsequently
approved the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement and it became effective on
September 29, 2006, replacing the investment advisory agreement with the
Previous Investment Adviser (the "Previous Investment Advisory Agreement").

The Board discussed the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement at telephonic
and in-person meetings held during April and May 2006. The Board, including the
independent directors, approved the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement at
an in-person meeting held on May 12, 2006.

To assist the Board in its consideration of the BlackRock Investment Advisory
Agreement, BlackRock provided materials and information about BlackRock,
including its financial condition and asset management capabilities and
organization, and Merrill Lynch provided materials and information about the
Transaction. The independent directors, through their independent legal counsel,
also requested and received additional information from Merrill Lynch and
BlackRock in connection with their consideration of the BlackRock Investment
Advisory Agreement. The additional information was provided in advance of the
May 12, 2006 meeting. In addition, the independent directors consulted with
their counsel and Fund counsel on numerous occasions, discussing, among other
things, the legal standards and certain other considerations relevant to the
directors' deliberations.

At the Board meetings, the directors discussed with Merrill Lynch management and
certain BlackRock representatives the Transaction, its strategic rationale and
BlackRock's general plans and intentions regarding the Fund. At these Board
meetings, representatives of Merrill Lynch and BlackRock made presentations to
and responded to questions from the Board. The directors also inquired about the
plans for and anticipated roles and responsibilities of certain employees and
officers of the Previous Investment Adviser, and of its affiliates, to be
transferred to BlackRock in connection with the Transaction. The independent
directors of the Board also conferred separately and with their counsel about
the Transaction and other matters related to the Transaction on a number of
occasions, including in connection with the April and May 2006 meetings. After
the presentations and after reviewing the written materials provided, the
independent directors met in executive sessions with their counsel to consider
the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement.

In connection with the Board's review of the BlackRock Investment Advisory
Agreement, Merrill Lynch and/or BlackRock advised the directors about a variety
of matters. The advice included the following, among other matters:

o     that there was not expected to be any diminution in the nature, quality
      and extent of services provided to the Fund and its shareholders by
      BlackRock Advisors, including compliance services;

o     that operation of New BlackRock as an independent investment management
      firm would enhance its ability to attract and retain talented
      professionals;

o     that the Fund was expected to benefit from having access to BlackRock's
      state of the art technology and risk management analytic tools, including
      investment tools, provided under the BlackRock Solutions(R) brand name;

o     that BlackRock had no present intention to alter any applicable expense
      waivers or reimbursements that were currently in effect and, while it
      reserved the right to do so in the future, it would seek the approval of
      the Board before making any changes;

o     that in connection with the Transaction, Merrill Lynch and BlackRock had
      agreed to conduct, and use reasonable best efforts to cause their
      respective affiliates to conduct, their respective businesses in
      compliance with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
      Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") in relation to any public funds advised by
      BlackRock or the Previous Investment Adviser (or affiliates),
      respectively; and

o     that Merrill Lynch and BlackRock would derive benefits from the
      Transaction and that, as a result, they had a financial interest in the
      matters being considered that was different from that of Fund
      shareholders.


20      BLACKROCK MUNIVEST FUND, INC.                    AUGUST 31, 2006
<PAGE>

The directors considered the information provided by Merrill Lynch and BlackRock
above, and, among other factors, the following:

o     the potential benefits to Fund shareholders from being part of a combined
      fund family with BlackRock-sponsored funds, including possible economies
      of scale and access to investment opportunities;

o     the reputation, financial strength and resources of BlackRock and its
      investment advisory subsidiaries and the anticipated financial strength
      and resources of New BlackRock;

o     the compliance policies and procedures of BlackRock Advisors;

o     the terms and conditions of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement,
      including the fact that the schedule of the Fund's total advisory fees
      would not increase under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, but
      would remain the same;

o     that in February 2006, the Board had performed a full annual review of the
      Previous Investment Advisory Agreement, as required by the 1940 Act, and
      had determined that the Previous Investment Adviser had the capabilities,
      resources and personnel necessary to provide the advisory and
      administrative services that were then being provided to the Fund; and
      that the advisory and/or management fees paid by the Fund, taking into
      account any applicable agreed-upon fee waivers and breakpoints, had
      represented reasonable compensation to the Previous Investment Adviser in
      light of the services provided, the costs to the Previous Investment
      Adviser of providing those services, economies of scale, the fees and
      other expenses paid by similar funds (including information provided by
      Lipper Inc. ("Lipper")), and such other matters as the directors had
      considered relevant in the exercise of their reasonable judgment; and

o     that Merrill Lynch had agreed to pay all expenses of the Fund in
      connection with the Board's consideration of the BlackRock Investment
      Advisory Agreement and related agreements and all costs of shareholder
      approval of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement and as a result
      the Fund would bear no costs in obtaining shareholder approval of the
      BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement.

Certain of these considerations are discussed in more detail below.

In its review of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board assessed
the nature, quality and scope of the services to be provided to the Fund by the
personnel of BlackRock Advisors and its affiliates, including administrative
services, shareholder services, oversight of fund accounting and assistance in
meeting legal and regulatory requirements. In its review of the BlackRock
Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board also considered a range of information
in connection with its oversight of the services to be provided by BlackRock
Advisors and its affiliates. Among the matters considered were: (a) fees (in
addition to management fees) to be paid to BlackRock Advisors and its affiliates
by the Fund; (b) Fund operating expenses paid to third parties; (c) the
resources devoted to and compliance reports relating to the Fund's investment
objective, policies and restrictions, and its compliance with its Code of Ethics
and BlackRock Advisors' compliance policies and procedures; and (d) the nature,
cost and character of non-investment management services to be provided by
BlackRock Advisors and its affiliates.

In the period prior to the Board meeting to consider renewal of the Previous
Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board had requested and received materials
specifically relating to the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement. These
materials included (a) information compiled by Lipper on the fees and expenses
and the investment performance of the Fund as compared to a comparable group of
funds as classified by Lipper; (b) information comparing the Fund's market price
with its net asset value per share; (c) a discussion by the Fund's portfolio
management team on investment strategies used by the Fund during its most recent
fiscal year; (d) information on the profitability to the Previous Investment
Adviser of the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement and other payments
received by the Previous Investment Adviser and its affiliates from the Fund;
and (e) information provided by the Previous Investment Adviser concerning
services related to the valuation and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings, the
Fund's portfolio turnover statistics, and direct and indirect benefits to the
Previous Investment Adviser and its affiliates from their relationship with the
Fund.

Disclosure of New Investment Advisory Agreement (continued)

In their deliberations, the directors considered information received in
connection with their most recent approval of the continuance of the Previous
Investment Advisory Agreement, in addition to information provided by BlackRock
and BlackRock Advisors in connection with their evaluation of the terms and
conditions of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement. The directors did not
identify any particular information that was all-important or controlling, and
each director attributed different weights to the various factors. The
directors, including a majority of the independent directors, concluded that the
terms of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement are appropriate, that the
fees to be paid are reasonable in light of the services to be provided to the
Fund, and that the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement should be approved
and recommended to Fund shareholders.

Nature, Quality and Extent of Services Provided -- The Board reviewed the
nature, quality and scope of services provided by the Previous Investment
Adviser, including the investment advisory services and the resulting
performance of the Fund, as well as the nature, quality and extent of services
expected to be provided by BlackRock Advisors. The Board focused primarily on
the Previous Investment Adviser's investment advisory services and the Fund's
investment performance, but also considered certain areas in which both the
Previous Investment Adviser and the Fund received services as part of the
Merrill Lynch complex. The Board compared the Fund's performance -- both
including and excluding the effects of fees and expenses -- to the performance
of a comparable group of funds, and the performance of a relevant index or
combination of indexes. While the Board reviews performance data at least
quarterly, consistent with the Previous Investment Adviser's investment goals,
the Board attaches more importance to performance over relatively long periods
of time, typically three to five years.

In evaluating the nature, quality and extent of the services to be provided by
BlackRock Advisors under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, the
directors considered, among other things, the expected impact of the Transaction
on the operations, facilities, organization and personnel of New BlackRock and
how it would affect the Fund; the ability of BlackRock Advisors to perform its
duties after the Transaction; and any anticipated changes to the current
investment and other practices of the Fund.

The directors were given information with respect to the potential benefits to
the Fund and its shareholders from having access to BlackRock's state of the art
technology and risk management analytic tools, including the investment tools
provided under the BlackRock Solutions brand name.

The directors were advised that, as a result of Merrill Lynch's equity interest
in BlackRock after the Transaction, the Fund would continue to be subject to
restrictions concerning certain transactions involving Merrill Lynch affiliates
(for example, transactions with a Merrill Lynch broker-dealer acting as
principal) absent revised or new regulatory relief. The directors were advised
that a revision of existing regulatory relief with respect to these restrictions
was being sought from the Securities and Exchange Commission and were advised of
the possibility of receipt of such revised regulatory relief.

Based on their review of the materials provided and the assurances they had
received from the management of Merrill Lynch and of BlackRock, the directors
determined that the nature and quality of services to be provided to the Fund
under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement were expected to be as good as
or better than that provided under the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement.
The directors were advised that BlackRock Advisors did not plan to change the
Fund's portfolio management team upon the closing of the transaction. It was
noted, however, that other changes in personnel were expected to follow the
Transaction and the combination of the operations of the Previous Investment
Adviser and its affiliates with those of BlackRock. The directors noted that if
current portfolio managers or other personnel were to cease to be available
prior to the closing of the Transaction, the Board would consider all available
options, including seeking the investment advisory or other services of
BlackRock affiliates. Accordingly, the directors concluded that, overall, they
were satisfied at the present time with assurances from BlackRock and BlackRock
Advisors as to the expected nature, quality and extent of the services to be
provided to the Fund under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability -- It was noted that, in
conjunction with the recent review of the Previous Investment Advisory
Agreement, the directors had received, among other things, a report from Lipper
comparing the Fund's fees and expenses to those of a peer group selected by
Lipper, and information as to the fees charged by the Previous Investment
Adviser or its affiliates to other registered investment company clients for
investment management services. The Board reviewed the Fund's contractual
management fee rate and actual management fee rate as a percentage of total
assets at common asset levels -- the actual rate includes advisory fees and the
effects of any fee

<PAGE>

waivers -- compared to the other funds in its Lipper category. They also
compared the Fund's total expenses to those of other comparable funds. The
information showed that the Fund had fees and expenses within the range of fees
and expenses of comparable funds. The Board considered the services to be
provided by and the fees to investment mandates and noted that the fees charged
by BlackRock Advisors in those cases, including fee waivers and expense
reimbursements, were generally comparable to those being charged to the Fund.
The Board concluded that the Fund's management fee and fee rate and overall
expense ratio are reasonable compared to those of other comparable funds.

In evaluating the costs of the services to be provided by BlackRock Advisors
under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, the directors considered,
among other things, whether advisory fees or other expenses would change as a
result of the Transaction. Based on their review of the materials provided and
the fact that the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement is substantially
similar to the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement in all material respects,
including the rate of compensation, the directors determined that the
Transaction should not increase the total fees payable, including any fee
waivers and expense reimbursements, for advisory and administrative services.
The directors noted that it was not possible to predict how the Transaction
would affect BlackRock Advisors' profitability from its relationship with the
Fund.

The directors discussed with BlackRock Advisors its general methodology to be
used in determining its profitability with respect to its relationship with the
Fund. The directors noted that they expect to receive profitability information
from BlackRock Advisors on at least an annual basis and thus be in a position to
evaluate whether any adjustments in Fund fees and/or fee breakpoints would be
appropriate.

Fees and Economies of Scale -- The Board considered the extent to which
economies of scale might be realized as the assets of the Fund increase and
whether there should be changes in the management fee rate or structure in order
to enable the Fund to participate in these economies of scale. The Board
determined that changes were not currently necessary.

In reviewing the Transaction, the directors considered, among other things,
whether advisory fees or other expenses would change as a result of the
Transaction. Based on the fact that the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement
is substantially similar to the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement in all
material respects, including the rate of compensation, the directors determined
that as a result of the Transaction, the Fund's total advisory fees would be no
higher than the fees under the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement. The
directors noted that in conjunction with their most recent deliberations
concerning the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement, they had determined that
the total fees for advisory and administrative services for the Fund were
reasonable in light of the services provided. It was noted that in conjunction
with the recent review of the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement, the
directors had received, among other things, a report from Lipper comparing the
Fund's fees, expenses and performance to those of a peer group selected by
Lipper, and information as to the fees charged by the Previous Investment
Adviser or its affiliates to other registered investment company clients for
investment management services. The directors concluded that because the rates
for advisory fees for the Fund would be no higher than the fee rates in effect
at the time, the proposed management fee structure, including any fee waivers,
was reasonable and that no additional changes were currently necessary.

Fall-Out Benefits -- In evaluating the fall-out benefits to be received by
BlackRock Advisors under the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, the
directors considered whether BlackRock Advisors would experience such benefits
to the same extent that the Previous Investment Adviser was experiencing such
benefits under the Previous Investment Advisory Agreement. Based on their review
of the materials provided, including materials received in connection with their
most recent approval of the continuance of the Previous Investment Advisory
Agreement, and their discussions with management of the Previous Investment
Adviser and BlackRock, the directors determined that BlackRock Advisors'
fall-out benefits could include increased ability for BlackRock to distribute
shares of its funds and other investment products. The directors noted that any
fall-out benefits were difficult to quantify with certainty at this time, and
indicated that they would continue to evaluate them going forward.

Investment Performance -- The directors considered investment performance for
the Fund. The directors compared the Fund's performance -- both including and
excluding the effects of fees and expenses -- to the performance of a comparable
group of funds, and the performance of a relevant index or combination of
indexes. The comparative information received from Lipper showed Fund
performance at various levels within the range of performance of comparable
funds over different time periods. While the Board reviews

Disclosure of New Investment Advisory Agreement (concluded)

performance data at least quarterly, consistent with the Previous Investment
Adviser's investment goals, the Board attaches more importance over relatively
long periods of time, typically three to five years. The directors believed the
Fund's performance was satisfactory. Also, the directors took into account the
investment performance of funds advised by BlackRock Advisors. The Board
considered comparative information from Lipper which showed that the performance
of the funds advised by BlackRock Advisors was within the range of performance
of comparable funds over different time periods. The Board noted BlackRock's
considerable investment management experience and capabilities, but was unable
to predict what effect, if any, consummation of the Transaction would have on
the future performance of the Fund.

Conclusion -- After the independent directors of the Fund deliberated in
executive session, the entire Board, including the independent directors,
approved the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, concluding that the
advisory fee rate was reasonable in relation to the services provided and that
the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the
shareholders. In approving the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, the
Board noted that it anticipated reviewing the continuance of the agreement in
advance of the expiration of the initial two-year period.

New BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement -- Matters Considered by the Board

At an in-person meeting held on August 14-16, 2006, the Board of Directors,
including the independent directors, discussed and approved the sub-advisory
agreement (the "BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement") between BlackRock Advisors
and its affiliate, BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"). The
BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement became effective on September 29, 2006, at the
same time the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement became effective.

Pursuant to the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Adviser receives a
monthly fee from BlackRock Advisors equal to 59% of the advisory fee received by
BlackRock Advisors from the Fund. BlackRock Advisors pays the Sub-Adviser out of
its own resources, and there is no increase in Fund expenses as a result of the
BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement.

In approving the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement at the August in-person
meeting, the Board reviewed its considerations in connection with its approval
of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement in May 2006. The Board relied on
the same information and considered the same factors as those discussed above in
connection with the approval of the BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement, and
came to the same conclusions. In reviewing the sub-advisory fee rate provided in
the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board noted the fact that both
BlackRock Advisors and the Sub-Adviser have significant responsibilities under
their respective advisory agreements. BlackRock Advisors remains responsible for
oversight of the Fund's operations and administration, and the Sub-Adviser
provides advisory services to the Fund and is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Fund's portfolio under the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement.
The Board also took into account the fact that there is no increase in total
advisory fees paid by the Fund as a result of the BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreement. Under all of the circumstances, the Board concluded that it was a
reasonable allocation of fees for the Sub-Adviser to receive 59% of the advisory
fee paid by the Fund to BlackRock Advisors.

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, the entire
Board, including the independent directors, approved the BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreement, concluding that the sub-advisory fee was reasonable in relation to
the services provided and that the Sub-Advisory Agreement was in the best
interests of shareholders.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

How the Plan Works -- The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by The Bank of New York (the
"Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a dividend,
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the participant's
account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized shares
of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares of
Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset value per share is equal to
or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a
condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest
the dividend amount in newly issued shares. If the Fund's net asset value per
share is greater than the market price per share (a condition often referred to
as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount by
purchasing on the open market additional shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend amount in open market purchases, or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent
will invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares. The shares acquired
are credited to each shareholder's account. The amount credited is determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by either (i) when the shares are
newly issued, the net asset value per share on the date the shares are issued or
(ii) when shares are purchased in the open market, the average purchase price
per share.

Participation in the Plan -- Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan -- The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants
in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they could otherwise
purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received. However, there may not be enough shares
available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price on resale
may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees -- There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders will
pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications -- The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore, income and
capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not receive
cash. The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be
excluded from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would
be excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a
market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a greater
fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible that all or
a portion of the discount from the market value (which may not exceed 5% of the
fair market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable
distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also
possible that the taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all
the shareholders, including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan.
Thus, shareholders who do not participate in the Plan might be required to
report as ordinary income a portion of their distributions equal to their
allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information -- All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY 10286-1258,
Telephone: 800-432-8224.

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

Availability of Quarterly Schedule of Investments

The Fund files its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the first and third quarters of each fiscal
year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Forms N-Q are available on the SEC's Web site at

BlackRock MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level
of current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.

         (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
         registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
         provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to the
         registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly to the
         operations and the financial reporting of the registrant. Certain of
         these non-audit services that the Committee believes are a) consistent
         with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b) routine and recurring
         services that will not impair the independence of the independent
         accountants may be approved by the Committee without consideration on a
         specific case-by-case basis ("general pre-approval"). However, such
         services will only be deemed pre-approved provided that any individual
         project does not exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or
         $50,000 for all of the registrants the Committee oversees. Any proposed
         services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific
         pre-approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject
         to general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
         The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

         Management Investment Companies -

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that the Investment Adviser considers
         the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the
         interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
         Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
         properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested

<PAGE>

         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

<PAGE>

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

         (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest

         BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
         compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
         protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
         another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address the
         allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
         transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
         conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
         accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
         furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
         clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
         applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
         accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have performance
         or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio managers have a
         personal interest in the receipt of such fees), which may be the same
         as or different from those made to the Fund. In addition, BlackRock,
         its affiliates and any officer, director, stockholder or employee may
         or may not have an interest in the securities whose purchase and sale
         BlackRock recommends to the Fund. BlackRock, or any of its affiliates,
         or any officer, director, stockholder, employee or any member of their
         families may take different actions than those recommended to the Fund
         by BlackRock with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock
         may refrain from rendering any advice or services concerning securities
         of companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
         directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
         which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors and
         employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest or
         possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager also
         may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be opposed
         to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection, it should be
         noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage certain accounts
         that are subject to performance fees. In addition, certain portfolio
         managers assist in managing certain hedge funds and may be entitled to
         receive a portion of any incentive fees earned on such funds and a
         portion of such incentive fees may be voluntarily or involuntarily
         deferred. Additional portfolio managers may in the future manage other
         such accounts or funds and may be entitled to receive incentive fees.

         As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
         must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
         securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated in a
         manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts to
         allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
         accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
         end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
         investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
         client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve reasonable
         efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock with sufficient
         flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that is consistent with
         the particular investment discipline and client base.

         (a)(3) As of October 2, 2006:

         BlackRock has adopted the compensation program utilized by MLIM for the
         remainder of 2006 with respect to portfolio managers of the Fund.

      Portfolio Manager Compensation

      The Portfolio Manager Compensation Program of BlackRock and its
affiliates, including the Investment Adviser, is critical to BlackRock's ability
to attract and retain the most talented asset management professionals. This
program ensures that compensation is aligned with maximizing investment returns
and it provides a competitive pay opportunity for competitive performance.

      Compensation Program

      The elements of total compensation for certain BlackRock and its
affiliates portfolio managers are a fixed base salary, annual performance-based
cash and stock compensation (cash and stock bonus) and other benefits. BlackRock
has balanced these components of pay to provide portfolio managers with a
powerful incentive to achieve consistently superior investment performance. By
design, portfolio manager compensation levels fluctuate--both up and down--with
the relative investment performance of the portfolios that they manage.

      Base Salary

      Under the BlackRock approach, like that of many asset management firms,
base salaries represent a relatively small portion of a portfolio manager's
total compensation. This approach serves to enhance the motivational value of
the performance-based (and therefore variable) compensation elements of the
compensation program.

      Performance-Based Compensation

      BlackRock believes that the best interests of investors are served by
recruiting and retaining exceptional asset management talent and managing their
compensation within a consistent and disciplined framework that emphasizes pay
for performance in the context of an intensely competitive market for talent. To
that end, certain BlackRock and its affiliates portfolio manager incentive
compensation is based on a formulaic compensation program. BlackRock's formulaic
portfolio manager compensation program includes: investment performance relative
to a subset of general, leveraged, municipal debt funds over 1-, 3- and 5-year
performance periods and a measure of operational efficiency. Portfolio managers
are compensated based on the pre-tax performance of the products they manage. If
a portfolio manager's tenure is less than 5 years, performance periods will
reflect time in position. Portfolio managers are compensated based on products
they manage. A discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may
include consideration of: financial results, expense control, profit margins,
strategic planning and implementation, quality of client service, market share,
corporate reputation, capital allocation, compliance and risk control,
leadership, workforce diversity, supervision, technology and innovation. All
factors are considered collectively by BlackRock management.

<PAGE>

      Cash Bonus

      Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a
combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with
base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for portfolio
managers.

      Stock Bonus

      A portion of the dollar value of the total annual performance-based bonus
is paid in restricted shares of BlackRock stock. Paying a portion of annual
bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given
year "at risk" based on the company's ability to sustain and improve its
performance over future periods. The ultimate value of stock bonuses is
dependent on future BlackRock stock price performance. As such, the stock bonus
aligns each portfolio manager's financial interests with those of the BlackRock
shareholders and encourages a balance between short-term goals and long-term
strategic objectives. Management strongly believes that providing a significant
portion of competitive performance-based compensation in stock is in the best
interests of investors and shareholders. This approach ensures that portfolio
managers participate as shareholders in both the "downside risk" and "upside
opportunity" of the company's performance. Portfolio managers therefore have a
direct incentive to protect BlackRock's reputation for integrity.

      Other Compensation Programs

      Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance and financial
management objectives during a performance year are eligible to participate in a
deferred cash program. Awards under this program are in the form of deferred
cash that may be benchmarked to a menu of certain BlackRock mutual funds
(including their own fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash
program aligns the interests of participating portfolio managers with the
investment results of BlackRock products and promotes continuity of successful
portfolio management teams.

      Other Benefits

      Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broad-based plans
offered generally to employees of BlackRock and its affiliates, including
broad-based retirement, 401(k), health, and other employee benefit plans.

      (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of October 2, 2006, Mr.
             Stuebe beneficially owns stock issued by the Fund valued in the
             range $100,001-$500,000. As of October 2, 2006, neither of Messrs.
             Jaeckel or O'Connor beneficially owns any stock issued by the Fund.
