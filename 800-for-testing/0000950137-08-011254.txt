PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period. The trust's adviser has waived or reimbursed fees and
expenses from time to time; absent such waivers/reimbursements the trust's
returns would have been lower. Periods of less than one year are not annualized.

The Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index is an
unmanaged, broadbased index that reflects the general performance of the U.S.
dollar denominated, fixed-rate, non-investment grade, taxable corporate bond
market. Issuers are capped at 2% of the index. It is not possible to invest
directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2008

MARKET CONDITIONS

Volatility remained high throughout the six-month reporting period as a
combination of tight credit conditions and a worsening economic outlook weighed
on the market. In the first quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve (the "Fed")
continued its aggressive efforts to boost liquidity and the economy, including
lowering the target federal funds rate by 200 basis points. The markets
continued to struggle, however, as mortgage-related writedowns by financial
institutions continued to mount and economic growth appeared to be slowing,
prompting concerns of recession. As the quarter neared a close, news that the
Fed had orchestrated the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase at a
fraction of its share price just weeks earlier further roiled the markets and
led to fears that the entire financial system was in trouble. In this
environment, the high yield bond market turned in its worst quarterly
performance in history as weaker economic data, poor earnings releases, rising
defaults and poor liquidity pushed prices considerably lower, leading to a
first-quarter return of -2.97 percent (as measured by the Lehman Brothers U.S.
Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index). As would be expected in a declining
market, lower-quality high yield bonds underperformed higher-quality issues.

Early in the second quarter, however, the Fed's efforts to enhance liquidity
began to take hold. Investors began to take on risk, and the high yield market
rebounded in April and May. In June, concerns about inflation grew, prompting
the Fed to hold the target federal funds rate steady at 2.0 percent, where it
had stood since the Fed's last rate cut in April, and the market to speculate
that its easing campaign had finally come to an end. Inflationary pressures,
coupled with new credit-related concerns caused investors to again question the
outlook for the market and the economy. As a result, the high yield market
reversed course, giving back much of the gains realized in the first two months
of the quarter. Nonetheless, the high yield bond market returned 1.95 percent,
beating equities for the second consecutive quarter. All high yield ratings
categories had positive returns in the second quarter, with lower-quality bonds
outperforming higher-quality bonds. High yield spreads tightened by 80 basis
points during the second quarter, ending the reporting period 736 basis points
over Treasuries. New high yield issuance remained low and while industry returns
varied considerably, finance companies were consistently among the worst
performers.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the Trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. The Trust underperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers U.S.
Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index, on both an NAV and market price basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and Trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

The Trust's underperformance versus the benchmark was due in part to its higher
relative credit quality. Although this defensive positioning was beneficial
early in the period when the higher quality sector of the market outperformed
the lower quality sector, it held back returns later in the period when lower
quality issues had stronger results. The Trust's holdings in mortgage securities
also held back performance as prices declined over the course of the period.

The Trust maintained an overweight relative to the benchmark in the health care
sector, which was additive to returns as the sector performed well during the
period. Additionally, the portfolio held no investments in the airline sector,
which was beneficial as the sector struggled amid rising fuel prices.

Throughout the period, we continued to seek to maintain a balanced and well-
diversified portfolio while allowing for strategic overweights in securities and
sectors that we believed possessed the most attractive risk profiles. In terms
of issuer size, we focused on larger companies because of their financial
flexibility, their ability to withstand less favorable financial conditions, and
their superior access to capital markets. At the end of the period, the Trust's
major sector overweights included health care, energy, and chemicals. Key sector
underweights included technology, buildings products/home builders, and
manufacturing.

The Trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
Trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. During the course of the
period, the Trust's borrowing activity became more expensive, thereby tempering
its benefits.

Although credit spreads narrowed somewhat during the second quarter, they still
remained much wider than long-term averages at the end of the period. As such,
we are seeking opportunities to increase the portfolio's risk profile to a more
neutral, rather than defensive, stance.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

At meetings held on April 15, 2008 and May 8, 2008, the Board of Trustees, and
the independent trustees voting separately, considered and ultimately determined
that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and
approved the continuance of the investment advisory agreement as being in the
best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In making its determination,
the Board of Trustees considered materials that were specifically prepared by
the investment adviser at the request of the Board and Fund counsel, and by an
independent provider of investment company data contracted to assist the Board,
relating to the investment advisory agreement review process. The Board also
considered information received periodically about the portfolio, performance,
the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and expenses of the
Fund. Finally, the Board considered materials it had received in approving a
voluntary waiver of advisory fees effective July 1, 2006. The Board of Trustees
considered the investment advisory agreement over a period of several months and
the trustees held sessions both with the investment adviser and separate from
the investment adviser in reviewing and considering the investment advisory
agreement.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees,

evaluated all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group
of factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund and changes made
in the Fund's portfolio management team and the Fund's portfolio management
strategy over time. The trustees also discuss certain other services which are
provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the investment adviser or its
affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain accounting, administrative
and legal services. The Board has determined that the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the investment adviser support its decision to
approve the investment advisory agreement.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory agreement.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio management-related
expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated expenses both on an
aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that the analysis of the
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory agreement.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Trust's investment objective is to
provide high current income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital
through investment in a professionally managed diversified portfolio of income
producing, fixed income securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not readily available, valuations are
obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price
established each day on the exchange on which they are traded. Swaps are valued
using market quotations obtained from brokers. Short-term securities with
remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

    The Trust adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"),
effective January 1, 2008. In accordance with FAS 157, fair value is defined as
the price that the Trust would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction with an independent buyer in the principal
market, or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for
the investment or liability. FAS 157 establishes a three-tier hierarchy to
distinguish between (1) inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data
obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs)
and (2) inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs) and to establish classification of fair value measurements
for disclosure purposes. Various inputs are used in determining the value of the
Trust's investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed
below.

    - Level 1--quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

    - Level 2--other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
      similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

    - Level 3--significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
      assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

    The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

</Table>

*   Other financial instruments include futures, forwards and swap contracts.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At June 30, 2008, the Trust had $90,000 of when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Trust adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes on June 30, 2007. FIN 48 sets forth a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any
unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements. If
applicable, the Trust recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits in "Interest Expense" and penalties in "Other"

                                                                              27

expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust files tax returns with the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and New York. Generally, each of the tax years in
the four year period ended December 31, 2007, remains subject to examination by
taxing authorities.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2007, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carry
forward for tax purposes of $56,962,475 which will expire according to the
following schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually on a pro rata basis to common and
preferred shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $15,356
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of gains or losses recognized on securities for
tax purposes but not for book purposes and deferral of losses relating to wash
sale transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets including preferred shares of
the Trust. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Adviser voluntarily
waived $34,505 of its investment advisory fees. This represents .05% of the
average daily net assets including preferred shares of the Trust. This waiver is
voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.

    For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $4,800 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the six months ended June 30,
2008, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $23,300 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

                                                                              29

</Table>

*   For the period ended December 31, 2007, the Trust repurchased 42,294 of its
    shares at an average discount of 6.269% from net asset value per share.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments and U.S. Government securities, were
$27,889,815 and $27,604,983, respectively. The cost of purchases and proceeds
from sales of long-term U.S. Government securities, including paydowns on
mortgage-backed securities, for the period were $0 and $54,934, respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as
to attempt to protect the Trust against possible changes in the market value of
its portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Trust's portfolio
holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with
the change in value reflected in the unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Upon
disposition, a realized gain or loss is recognized accordingly, except when
taking delivery of a security underlying a futures contract. In these instances,
the recognition of gain or loss is postponed until the disposal of the security
underlying the futures contract. Risks may arise as a result of the potential
inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in futures on U.S. Treasury Bonds or Notes. Upon
entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of cash or liquid
securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract amount with either
a futures commission merchant pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated
under the 1940 Act, or with its custodian in an account in the broker's name.
This amount is known as initial margin. During the period the futures contract
is open, payments are received from or made to the broker based upon changes in
the value of the contract (the variation margin). The risk of loss associated
with a futures contract is in excess of the variation margin reflected on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

</Table>

B. SWAP CONTRACTS The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts for
hedging purposes or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may
otherwise invest. A credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to
exchange the credit risk of an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said
to buy protection by paying periodic fees in return for a contingent payment
from the seller if the issuer has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure
to pay outstanding obligations or deteriorating credit while the swap is
outstanding. A seller of a credit default swap is said to sell protection and
thus collects the periodic fees and profits if the credit of the issuer remains
stable or improves while the swap is outstanding but the seller in a credit
default swap contract would be required to pay an agreed-upon amount, which
approximates the notional amount of the swap as disclosed in the table following
the Portfolio of Investments, to the buyer in the event of an adverse credit
event of the issuer. The Trust accrues for the periodic fees on credit default
swaps on a daily basis with the net amount accrued recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts. Upon cash settlement of the
periodic fees, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swap
contracts on the Statement of Operations. Net unrealized gains are recorded as
an asset or net unrealized losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value of the swap contracts is reported
as unrealized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations. Payments received
or made upon entering into a credit default swap contract, if any, are recorded
as realized gain or loss on the Statement of Operations upon termination or
maturity of the swap. Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a
Trust had invested in the issuer directly. Credit default swaps are subject to
general market risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.

    The Trust may also enter into interest rate swaps primarily to preserve a
return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio, as a
duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of
securities the Trust anticipates purchasing at a later date. Interest rate swaps
are contractual agreements to exchange periodic interest payment streams
calculated on a predetermined notional principal amount. Interest rate swaps
generally involve one party paying a fixed interest rate and the other party
paying a variable rate. The Trust will usually enter into interest rate swaps on
a net basis, i.e., the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement
on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument, with the Trust
receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two
payments. The Trust accrues the net amount with respect to each interest rate
swap on a daily basis. This net amount is recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on swap contracts. Upon cash settlement of the
periodic payments, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swap
contracts on the Statement of Operations. Risks may arise as a result of the
potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

                                                                              31

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

    If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap agreement, the Trust
will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. Counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on
the valuation of each swap) on behalf of the Trust with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain. Reciprocally, when the Trust has an
unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Trust has instructed the custodian to
pledge cash or liquid securities as collateral with a value approximately equal
to the amount of the unrealized loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate. Cash collateral
is disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments. Cash
collateral has been offset against open swap contracts under the provisions of
FASB Interpretation No. 39: Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts
an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105 and are
included within "Swap Contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. For
cash collateral received, the Trust pays a monthly fee to the counterparty based
on the effective rate for Federal Funds. This fee, when paid, is included within
realized loss on swap contracts on the Statement of Operations.

6. MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES

The Trust may invest in various types of Mortgage Backed Securities. A Mortgage
Backed Security (MBS) is a pass-through security created by pooling mortgages
and selling participations in the principal and interest payments received from
borrowers. Most of these securities are guaranteed by federally sponsored
agencies--Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNMA) or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). A
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) is a bond which is collateralized by a
pool of MBS's.

    These securities derive their value from or represent interests in a pool of
mortgages, or mortgage securities.

    Mortgage securities are subject to prepayment risk--the risk that, as
mortgage interest rates fall, borrowers will refinance and "prepay" principal. A
fund holding mortgage securities that are experiencing prepayments will have to
reinvest these payments at lower prevailing interest rates. On the other hand,
when interest rates rise, borrowers are less likely to refinance resulting in
lower prepayments. This can effectively extend the maturity of a fund's mortgage
securities resulting in greater price volatility. It can be difficult to measure
precisely the remaining life of a mortgage security or the average life of a
portfolio of such securities.

    To the extent a fund invests in mortgage securities offered by
non-governmental issuers, such as commercial banks, savings and loan
institutions, private mortgage insurance companies, mortgage bankers and other
secondary market issuers, the Trust may be subject to additional risks. Timely
payment of interest and principal of non-governmental issuers are supported by
various forms of private insurance or guarantees, including individual loan,
title, pool and hazard insurance purchased by the issuer. There can be no
assurance that the private insurers can meet their obligations under the
policies.

    An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage
pool may adversely affect the value of a mortgage backed security and could
result in losses to a Trust. The risk of such defaults is generally higher in
the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages
refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with a lower
capacity to make timely payment on their mortgages.

7. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 2,616 Auction Preferred Shares (APS). Series A
contains 1,112 shares and Series B contains 1,504 shares. Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rate on each series is currently reset every 28 days
through an auction process. Beginning on February 20, 2008 and continuing
through June 30, 2008, all series of preferred shares of the Trust were not
successfully remarketed. As a result, the dividend rates of these preferred
shares were reset to the maximum applicable rate on APS. If the preferred shares
are unable to be remarketed on a remarketing date, the Trust would be required
to pay the maximum applicable rate on APS to holders of such shares for
successive dividend periods until such time when the shares are successfully
remarketed. The maximum rate on APS is equal to 150% of the applicable
commercial paper rate on the date. The average rate in effect on June 30, 2008
was 7.078%. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the rates ranged from
4.400% to 7.103%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

9. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

On March 19, 2008, Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities (FAS 161). FAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about
objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about
fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and
disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
agreements. The application of FAS 161 is required for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after November 15, 2008. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FAS 161 and its impact on the financial
statements has not yet been determined.

                                                                              33

     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
