                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management
                              groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                              Templeton offers investors a truly global
                              perspective.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                              it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                              arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to different investment approaches,
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                              typically have distinct portfolios. That's why our
                              funds can be used to build truly diversified
                              allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                              that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                              names in financial services.

spending relies on consumers' ability to remain gainfully employed, many
analysts study the employment picture for indications of consumer spending. For
most of the reporting period, nonfarm payroll data, as well as other indexes,
showed growing employment. This along with other factors helped consumer
spending increase 6.7% (not adjusted for inflation) in September 2005 compared
with the same month a year earlier, which supported U.S. economic growth.(1)

Business spending also rose during the reporting period, contributing to
economic growth. Nonresidential investment spending rose 8.8% in the second
quarter of 2005 and 6.2% in the third quarter.(1) Historically low interest
rates continued to allow many companies easy access to capital, and ample cash
also helped some companies to support their spending plans. Productivity
continued to grow, which helped businesses generate more goods and services
without substantially raising inflation.

Oil prices increased substantially during the period amid concerns about
potential long-term supply limitations in the face of expected strong global
demand growth, especially from China and India. Despite rising commodity prices,
inflation remained relatively contained for the 12 months ended September 30,
2005, as measured by the 2.0% rise for the core Consumer Price Index (CPI).(2)
This increase was below the core CPI's 10-year average of 2.2%.(2) However,
acknowledging the economy's strength as well as potential inflationary pressure
from high energy prices, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) raised the federal
funds target rate to 3.75% from 2.75% during the six-month period and indicated
possible "measured" increases would follow. The Fed also noted in its most
recent statement that there would be some temporary economic effects due to
hurricane impacts, but there was some debate about the long-term effects. During
the period, the yield curve flattened, as short- and intermediate-term Treasury
yields rose and longer-term yields fell.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond

and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

During this reporting period, the three core investment categories in which the
Fund invests generated similar returns, although high yield corporate bonds and
bank loans delivered the strongest performance. Both of these asset classes
benefited from improving credit fundamentals, which were in turn driven by the
favorable economic environment. In addition, bank loans experienced increases in
their income streams since their payouts are tied to rising short-term interest
rates. Returns on fixed-rate mortgages and other asset-backed securities
slightly trailed those of the other sectors, as they entered the period offering
a lower yield than high yield corporate bonds and their income distributions did
not increase along with short-term interest rates.

In terms of sector allocation, high yield corporate bonds represented our
largest weighting at period-end, as we believed fundamental credit trends such
as positive corporate earnings growth, low default rates and balance sheet
liquidity could provide support for such issuers. However, the high yield market
did experience some volatility during the first half of the reporting period
with the expected rating downgrades of General Motors' and Ford's corporate
bonds as well as broad equity market weakness weighing on the sector. As a
result, yield spreads over Treasuries, as measured by the CSFB High Yield Index,
widened from 3.7 percentage points at the beginning of the period to 4.6 in
mid-May, before rebounding to end the period at 3.8 percentage points above
Treasuries. Although we remained positive about the fundamental credit trends
for high yield corporate bonds, we reduced our sector exposure during the latter
half of the period as the sector recovered mid-period and valuations again
became richer.

During the period under review, the bank loan market remained strong, benefiting
from the combination of favorable credit fundamentals and rising interest rates,
and strong demand stemmed from an influx of new institutional investors and
structured investment vehicles participating in this market.

Earnings concerns at General Motors and Ford along with subsequent downgrades by
rating agencies, as noted earlier, created volatility in the high yield
corporate debt markets that eventually spilled over into the loan market and
caused prices to drop slightly in April and May. From June to the end of the
period, however, secondary loan prices rebounded and new-issue spreads
tightened, as investors seemed to take comfort in corporate credit fundamentals
as well as the low default rate environment. In this rising short-term interest
rate environment, we found the floating-rate feature attractive and increased
our exposure to bank loans during the period.

In the mortgage- and other asset-backed securities sector, the to-be-announced
(TBA) mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market became less attractive to us, and
we increased our focus and research on specified MBS pools.(3) By applying our
research expertise within the specified pool marketplace, we sought to improve
this sector's total return potential. Overall, the Fund's allocation to the
mortgage-and asset-backed securities sector remained relatively flat over the
period.

(3)   A specified pool consists of previously identified mortgage pools. A TBA
      security consists of generic mortgage pools to be determined at the
      settlement date.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and
simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions
("Distributions") in shares of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (the "Agent"), P.O. Box
43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the
Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as
your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rate share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed it purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


8 | Semiannual Report

<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American stock exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve your of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of

<PAGE>

the Fund, no certificates for a fractional share will be issued. Distributions
on fractional shares will be credited to your account. If you terminate your
account under the Plan, the Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional
interest in cash at the market value of shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at 1-800/331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.    ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (the Fund) is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A.    SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities, mortgage pass-through securities, other
mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis to determine
current value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1.    ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A.    SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B.    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C.    SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, OR TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, or
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to

market fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at delivery may
be more or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the Fund will
generally purchase these securities with the intention of holding the
securities, it may sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient
assets have been segregated for these securities.

D.    FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E.    SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

F.    INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income
and net realized gains.

G.    SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the

loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These differences may be permanent or temporary.
Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their
tax character. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the
results of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they will
reverse in subsequent periods.

H.    OFFERING COSTS

Offering costs are charged to paid-in-capital upon the initial sale of Fund
shares.

I.    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J.    GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and Trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2.    SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At September 30, 2005, there were 28,290,900 shares authorized (no par value).
During the period ended September 30, 2005, there were no share transactions;
all reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously issued shares
purchased in the open market.

3.    AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. Dividends to
preferred shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates
established through an auction process. During the period ended September 30,
2005, the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from 2.75% to 3.70%.

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the period ended September 30, 2005, all requirements were met.

6.    INCOME TAXES

At September 30, 2005, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments ..........................   $ 577,056,247
                                                 =============

Unrealized appreciation ......................   $   7,738,664
Unrealized depreciation ......................      (6,182,801)
                                                 -------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ...   $   1,555,863
                                                 =============

For tax purposes, realized capital losses occurring subsequent to October 31,
may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. At March 31, 2005, the Fund deferred realized capital losses of
$640,417.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, paydown losses,
and bond discounts and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar roll, paydown losses, and bond discounts and
premiums.

7.    INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended September 30, 2005, aggregated $143,993,478 and $142,258,119,
respectively.

8.    INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET
      PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund.

9.    CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 65.43% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

10.   REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.

Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop a plan for distribution of the
respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan under the
CAGO Settlement and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
settlement, the monies were disbursed to the relevant funds. The Fund did not
participate in the CAGO Settlement. The SEC has not yet approved the
distribution plan pertaining to the December 13, 2004 SEC Order. When approved,
disbursements of settlement monies will be made promptly to the relevant funds,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of that order. The IDC continues to
develop the plan of distribution under the August 2, 2004 SEC Order that
resolved the SEC's market timing investigation.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices described above.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intends to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved
in the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders. The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor
which the manager considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is
not determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice,
the votes with respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position
of the company's management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own
merits, and the manager will not support the position of the company's
management in any situation where it deems that the ratification of management's
position would adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's
shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Dated July 2004

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;



- -----------------------------
1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.







     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.


- -----------------

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.






     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.


- ---------------------

5 See Part X.






IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's  internal control over
