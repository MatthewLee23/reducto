Chairman's
     LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Once again, I am pleased to report that over the most recent fiscal year your
Fund continued to provide you with monthly tax-free income and an attractive
total return. For more specific information about the performance of your Fund,
please see the Portfolio Manager's Perspective and Performance Overview sections
of this report.

With longer-term interest rates still relatively low, many investors have begun
to wonder whether these rates will soon begin to rise, and whether that makes
this the time to adjust their holdings of fixed-income investments. No one knows
what the future will bring, which is why we think a well-balanced portfolio that
is structured and carefully monitored with the help of an investment
professional


"OUR MISSION CONTINUES TO BE TO ASSIST YOU AND YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR BY

can be an important component in achieving your long-term financial goals. A
well-diversified portfolio may actually help to reduce your overall investment
risk, and we believe that a municipal bond investment like your Nuveen Fund can
be an important building block in a portfolio designed to perform well through a
variety of market conditions.

As in past reports, I'd also like to direct your attention to the inside front
cover, which explains the quick and easy process to begin receiving these Fund

Nuveen Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds
NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, NXZ, NZF



Portfolio Manager's
        PERSPECTIVE

Portfolio manager Tom Spalding discusses the economic and market environment,
key investment strategies, and the fiscal year performance of these six Funds.
With 27 years of investment experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ since its
inception in 2001, and NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and NZF since 2003.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE ANNUAL
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2004?

During this fiscal year, the U.S. economy demonstrated improvement in a number
of key areas, although the pace of the recovery slowed over the last six months
of the period. The gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at annualized rates of
4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 4.5% in the first quarter of 2004.
However, sharply higher energy prices restrained consumer spending during the
second and third quarters of 2004, which in turn impacted economic momentum.
Over this period, GDP growth moderated to 3.3% annualized in the second quarter
and 3.9% annualized in the third quarter.

Higher energy costs also continued to fuel lingering concerns about inflation.
Although monthly gains in consumer prices were generally tame, by the end of
October 2004 inflation was running well ahead of the 2003 pace. The Consumer
Price Index (CPI) rose at a 3.9% annualized rate for the first 10 months of
2004, more than double the 1.9% rate for all of 2003. Excluding energy and food,
the CPI increased at an annual rate of 2.4% for the first 10 months of 2004.

During the second quarter of 2004 in particular, inflation worries, the slowing
pace of economic recovery and continued geopolitical uncertainty acted as
catalysts for heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets. As one example,
the yield on the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index (BB25), a widely followed
municipal bond index, began this reporting period at 5.24%. The BB25 yield then
dropped steadily over the next five months to 4.73% by mid-March 2004. As a
series of improved employment reports sparked increased anticipation of action
by the Federal Reserve, the index yield began to climb again, rising more than
70 basis points over the next 8 weeks to 5.45%, where it hovered through the end
of June. However, more bond-friendly news--including indications of relatively
slow growth of wages and employment--prompted a retreat to 4.97% by the end of
October 2004.

While intermediate and long-term bond yields generally fell over most of the
second half of the Funds' fiscal years, short-term rates slowly rose. The
Federal Reserve instituted three different one-quarter-point increases in the
fed funds rate between June and


                                       4

<PAGE>

September 2004. (On both November 10 and December 14, following the end of this
reporting period, the Fed added additional quarter-point increases, bringing the
fed funds rate to 2.25%.)

Over the 12 month period, municipal new issue supply nationwide remained
relatively strong, with $363.4 billion in new bonds coming to market. This
represented a decrease of about 5% from the preceding 12-month period, as the
improving economy and higher tax revenues lessened the need for some issuers to
borrow.

IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING
THE 12 MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2004?

As the market continued to anticipate increased interest rates, our focus during
this fiscal year remained on purchasing bonds that we believed had the potential
to add value and perform well under a variety of market scenarios. In general,
our purchase activity for all six of these Funds centered on trying to find
attractive securities in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve, that is,
bonds that mature in 20 to 25 years.

One of our longer-term goals was to work to position all of these Funds so that
they produce less volatile, roughly equivalent returns over time. As one
strategy to reach this goal for some of the newer Funds, we have attempted to
reduce some of NXZ's interest rate risk by hedging in the derivatives markets.
(Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a Fund's portfolio will
decline if market interest rates rise, since bond prices move in the opposite
direction of interest rates.) Our only objective with these hedges is to reduce
the Fund's interest rate risk, and not to potentially enhance its return by
making a prediction about future interest rates. This hedge does not affect
NXZ's income stream or dividend-paying capabilities over the short-term.
Instead, the costs of the hedge are reflected as an addition or subtraction to
the Fund's net asset value as the market value of the hedge fluctuates. Although
the hedge had a negative market value as of October 31, 2004, it succeeded in
reducing some of the volatility of NXZ's net asset value over the course of the
reporting period.

In NZF, we sought to shorten the Fund's duration1 to mitigate some of its
interest rate risk. To accomplish this goal, we sold some of NZF's holdings with
the longest maturities and reinvested the proceeds in bonds from the
intermediate part of the yield curve.

Demand for municipal securities remained firm through most of this reporting
period, which limited our ability to find bonds with attractive prices, yields
and structures. Since insured bonds accounted for about 50% of new municipal
bond issuance during this period, we often looked to this area for buying
opportunities.


1    Duration is a measure of a Fund's net asset value (NAV) volatility in
     reaction to interest rate movements. Fund duration, also known as
     leverage-adjusted duration, takes into account the leveraging process for a
     Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
     portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund. References to duration
     in this commentary are intended to indicate Fund duration unless otherwise
     noted.


                                       5

<PAGE>

We also sought to purchase higher-coupon bonds that we believed could help
support the Funds' dividends, and we worked to enhance the Funds' call
protection by selling several bonds with short call dates and reinvesting the
proceeds in longer-term securities with better call protection.

Past performance is not predictive of future results.

For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for your
Fund in this report.


For the 12 months ended October 31, 2004, the total returns on net asset value
(NAV) for all six Funds in this report outperformed the return on the Lehman
Brothers Index. All of the Funds also outperformed the average return for their
Lipper peer group for this period.

One of the primary factors benefiting the 12-month performances of these six
Funds relative to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers index was the Funds'
use of financial leverage. While leverage can add volatility to the Funds' NAVs
and share prices, especially when substantial shifts in interest rates occur,
this strategy also can provide opportunities for additional income and total
returns for common shareholders when short-term interest rates remain low, as
they did during this period.

All six Funds also benefited from their holdings of lower quality bonds, which
generally outperformed higher credit quality sectors as the economy improved and
demand for

     national index comprising a broad range of investment-grade municipal
     bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

3    The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds category average is
     calculated using the returns of all national closed-end exchange-traded
     funds in this category for each period as follows: 1 year, 65 funds; 5
     years, 51 funds; and 10 years, 46 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume
     reinvestment of dividends.


                                       6

lower-rated bonds increased. Among the lower-rated bonds making positive
contributions to the Funds' total returns during this period were those issued
by the healthcare sector, especially hospital bonds. The performance of the
healthcare sector as a whole ranked second among the Lehman Brothers Index's
revenue sectors for the 12-month period. As of October 31, 2004, NXZ had 25% of
its portfolio in healthcare bonds, while NMA and NZF each had 17%, NAD had 16%,
and NPP and NMO had 10%. In particular, NMA and NXZ benefited from their
holdings of bonds issued by the Michigan State Hospital Finance Authority for
Detroit Medical Center, which appreciated in price as the center's financial
situation continued to improve.

The Funds' returns were also helped by the strong performance of their holdings
of uninsured bonds backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement agreement. Over
this period, NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF maintained exposures of approximately 5%
in tobacco bonds, while NXZ continued to allocate about 3% to this sector.

One sector that did not perform well during this period was housing, both
multifamily and single family. The housing sector as a whole ranked at the
bottom of the Lehman Brothers Index revenue sectors for the 12-month period. The
sector's below-market performance stemmed largely from the increase in mortgage
prepayments as interest rates remained low, which resulted in a number of bond
calls. In general, the Funds' housing exposure had a negative impact on their
performance, with NMA and NZF having the heaviest weightings in housing bonds.

In addition, the annual performance of NMO was negatively affected by the
continued deterioration of its holding of bonds issued by the Indianapolis
Airport Authority and backed by United Airlines. These bonds declined in value
to $0.11 on the dollar as of October 31, 2004.

HOW ABOUT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates remaining relatively low throughout this
reporting period, the leveraged structures of these six Funds continued to
support their dividend-paying capabilities. The extent of this benefit is tied
in part to the short-term rates these Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R)
shareholders. During periods of low short-term rates, leveraged Funds generally
pay relatively lower dividends to their MuniPreferred shareholders, which can
leave more earnings to support common share dividends. This strategy enabled us
to increase the dividend of NZF in December 2003 and helped us to maintain the
dividends of NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NXZ throughout the reporting period.

All of these Funds seek to pay stable dividends at rates that reflect each
Fund's past results and projected future performance. During certain periods,
each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less than the amount
of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the period. If a
Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it holds the
excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as part of the
Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in excess of
its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise reflected in
the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net investment income
as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2004, all six of these Funds had
positive UNII balances for both financial statement and tax purposes.

As of October 31, 2004, all six of these Funds were trading at discounts to
their NAVs. These discounts were generally in line with the Funds' average
discounts over the entire 12-month reporting period.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
OCTOBER 31, 2004?

Given the current geopolitical and economic climate, we continued to believe
that maintaining strong credit quality was an important requirement for the
Funds. As of October 31, 2004, these six Funds continued to offer excellent
credit quality, with allocations of bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed and AA
ranging from 68% in NXZ to 74% in NMA, 80% in NMO and NAD, and 82% in NPP and
NZF.

As of October 31, 2004, potential call exposure for these Funds during 2004-2006
ranged from 4% in NXZ, to 5% in NZF, 9% in NMO, 10% in NAD, 14% in NPP and 16%
in NMA. The number of actual bond calls in all of these Funds depends largely on
market interest rates in the future.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. For
     investments that generate qualified dividend income, the taxable-equivalent
     yield is lower.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. For
     investments that generate qualified dividend income, the taxable-equivalent
     yield is lower.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 as of October
31, 2004, and the related statements of operations for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for the periods indicated therein. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures
included confirmation of investments owned as of October 31, 2004, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing
procedures where replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 3 at October 31, 2004, the results of their operations
for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for the periods
indicated therein in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

                         was likely United would not remain current on their
                         interest payment obligations with respect to these
                         bonds and thus has stopped accruing interest.

Notes to
       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. If it is
determined that market prices for a security are unavailable or inappropriate,
the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a
fair value for the security. Temporary investments in securities that have
variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2004,
Performance Plus (NPP)and Dividend Advantage (NAD) had outstanding when-issued
purchase commitments of $3,702,086 and $24,582,900, respectively. There were no
such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Professional Fees

Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations, audit fees, tax consulting fees
and, in some cases, workout expenditures. Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an investment, or to pursue other claims or
legal actions on behalf of the Fund's shareholders. Legal fee refund presented
on the Statement of Operations for Market Opportunity (NMO) reflects a refund of
workout expenditures paid in a prior reporting period.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute all net investment income and net capital gains to
shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore, each Fund
intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from municipal
securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain such
tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. All monthly
tax-exempt income dividends paid during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004,
have been designated Exempt Interest Dividends. Net realized capital gains and
ordinary income distributions made by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.


                                       70

<PAGE>

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate on each Series is
determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the
auction agent, and is payable weekly at the end of each rate period. The number
of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund is as
follows:

Forward Swap Transactions

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments. The Funds' use
of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to mitigate the negative
impact that an increase in long-term interest rates could have on Common share
net earnings. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve each Fund's
agreement with the counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed rate payment in
exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable rate payment. The
amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional or nominal amount of
the forward swap contract. The Funds may close out a contract prior to the
effective date. When a forward swap is terminated, it does not involve the
delivery of securities of other underlying assets or principal, but rather is
settled in cash. Each Fund intends to, but is not obligated to, terminate its
forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with
respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit
risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment. To minimize
such credit risk, all counterparties are required to segregate collateral daily
(based on the daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value
approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain. Reciprocally, when any
of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have
instructed the custodian to segregate assets of the Funds as collateral with a
value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss. The Funds help
reduce the credit risks associated with forward swap transactions by entering
into agreements only with counterparties the Adviser believes have the financial
resources to honor their obligations and by having the Adviser monitor the
financial stability of the swap counterparties.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, its Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

As approved by the Board of Directors/Trustees, effective August 1, 2004, a
complex-wide management fee structure was adopted for all funds sponsored by
Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. and its affiliates. This fee structure separates each fund's
management fee into two components - a complex-level component, based on the
aggregate amount of all funds assets managed by the Adviser and its affiliates,
and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets within
each individual fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund shareholders to
benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as well as from
growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser and its
affiliates. Under no circumstances will this pricing structure result in a fund
paying management fees at a rate higher than would otherwise have been
applicable had the complex-wide management fee structure not been implemented.
As a consequence of this new management fee structure, the funds' effective
management fees were reduced by approximately .006% as of November 30, 2004.

Effective August 1, 2004, the annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each
of the Funds is based upon the average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to Preferred shares) of each Fund as follows:

                                                          PERFORMANCE PLUS (NPP)

Effective August 1, 2004, the annual complex-level fee, payable monthly, which
is additive to the fund-level fee, for all Nuveen sponsored funds in the U.S.,
is based on the aggregate amount of total fund assets managed as follows:

================================================================================


(1)  The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
     calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
     the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
     all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
     in the U.S.

(2)  With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
     rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
     date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
     billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
     be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
     fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
     time as a different rate or rates is determined.

Each Fund paid through July 31, 2004, an annual management fee, payable monthly,
at the rates set forth below, which were based upon the average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to Preferred shares) of each Fund as follows:

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to their officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised Funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
Funds.

For the first ten years of Dividend Advantage's (NAD) operations, the Adviser
has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and expenses

Reinvest Automatically
       EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.


NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit,nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
the dividends or distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price
may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per
share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond
or bond fund's value to changes when interest rates change. Generally, the
longer a bond or fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will
change as interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account
the leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted

ethics on its website at www.nuveen.com/etf.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of
Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit committee
financial expert is Jack B. Evans, Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is
"independent" for purposes of Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Mr. Evans has served as the
registrant's audit committee financial expert from July 26, 2004 to the end of

Prior to July 26, 2004, William E. Bennett, who was "independent" for purposes
of Item 3 of Form N-CSR, served as the audit committee financial expert.
Although Mr. Bennett served as the audit committee financial expert during the
reporting period, he unexpectedly resigned from the Board effective April 30,
2004. Accordingly for this reporting period, the registrant did not have a
designated "audit committee financial expert" from May 1, 2004 to July 26, 2004.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other

actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation
of financial statements. Mr. Evans also formerly chaired the audit committee of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

Mr. Bennett was formerly Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of
First Chicago Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The First National Bank
of Chicago. As part of his role as Chief Credit Officer, Mr. Bennett set policy
as to accrual of assets/loans; designated performing/non-performing assets; set

value of credit related assets and exposure. Among other things, Mr. Bennett was
also responsible for the oversight of the internal analysis function including
setting ground rules for the review and preparation of financial analysis and
financial statements for use in making credit and risk decisions for clients.
Mr. Bennett has significant experience reviewing, analyzing and evaluating
financial statements of domestic and international companies in a variety of
industries with complex accounting issues.


ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.



                   NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 3

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Audit Committee approved in advance all audit services and non-audit services
that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the Fund, except for those non-audit services
that were subject to the pre-approval exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation
S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The pre-approval exception for services
provided directly to the Fund waives the pre-approval requirement for services
other than audit, review or attest services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all
such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid by the Fund to its accountant during the fiscal year in which the
services are provided; (B) the Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit
services at the time of the engagement; and (C) the services are promptly
brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and the Committee (or its delegate)
approves the services before the audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

                 SERVICES THAT THE FUND'S AUDITOR BILLED TO THE
                  ADVISER AND AFFILIATED FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The following tables show the amount of fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP to

controlled by or under common control with NAC ("Control Affiliate") that
provides ongoing services to the Fund ("Affiliated Fund Service Provider"), for
engagements directly related to the Fund's operations and financial reporting,
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years.

The table also shows the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval
exception. The pre-approval exception for services provided to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider (other than audit, review or attest
services) waives the pre-approval requirement if: (A) the aggregate amount of
all such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid to Ernst & Young LLP by the Fund, the Adviser and Affiliated Fund
Service Providers during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that
would have to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; (B) the Fund did not
recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and

                               NON-AUDIT SERVICES

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. For
engagements entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Audit Committee is
required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provides to
the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the engagement related
directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting (except for those
subject to the de minimis exception described above). The Audit Committee
requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about any non-audit
services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last fiscal year to
the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The Committee considered
this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the audit
committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the audit committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the audit committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the audit committee at
the next audit committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
audit committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). The members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner,
Lawrence H. Brown, Jack B. Evans and William J. Schneider.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer held by the Fund were to issue a proxy
or that the Fund were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security,
the Adviser would either engage an independent third party to determine how the
proxy should be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the
instructions, of the Fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or its
representative. In the case of a conflict of interest, the proxy would be
submitted to the applicable Fund's Board to determine how the proxy should be
voted. A member of the Adviser's legal department would oversee the
administration of the voting, and ensure that records were maintained in
accordance with Rule 204-2(c)(2) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (17
CFR 275.204-2(c)(2)), reports were filed with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the
results were provided to the Board of Directors or Trustees and made available
to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

Not applicable at this time.

COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

In the event of a vacancy on the Board, the nominating and governance committee
receives suggestions from various sources, including shareholders, as to
suitable candidates. Suggestions should be sent in writing to Lorna Ferguson,
Vice President for Board Relations, Nuveen Investments, 333 West Wacker Drive,
Chicago, IL 60606. The nominating and governance committee sets appropriate
standards and requirements for nominations for new directors or trustees and
reserves the right to interview all candidates and to make the final selection
of any new directors or trustees.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          or persons performing similar functions, have concluded that the
          registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
          30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
          "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective, as of a date within
          90 days of the filing date of this report that includes the disclosure
          required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of the controls
          and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
          270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act
          (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
          of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or
          is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.

exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a)(1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to

because posted on registrant's website at www.nuveen.com/etf.

(a)(2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
