Dividend Reinvestment Plans

Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC, at
800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If you have
shares registered in a "street" name, contact your financial advisor or the
broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund, and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, all distributions
of net investment income and capital gains to common stock shareholders are
automatically reinvested in additional shares unless shareholders elect to
receive all dividends and other distributions in cash paid by check mailed
directly to shareholders by the dividend plan agent. Under the current policies
of Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, distributions of net investment
income and capital gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash unless
shareholders notify Mellon Investor Services LLC of their desire to participate
in the dividend reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.

Q: What was the investment environment like for municipal bond funds during the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2006?

A: Changes in interest rates and municipal bond refinancings were among the key
stories in the municipal bond market during the fiscal year.

The Federal Reserve Board remained committed to tightening U.S. monetary policy,
focused on keeping inflation in check. This included a continuous string of
eight quarter-point increases to the fed funds rate, which took this target for
short-term interest rates from 2.75% on March 22, 2005 to 4.75% as of March 31,
2006 (source: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board).

Despite the fed's actions on short-term interest rates, however, longer term
rates did not increase and generally remained low throughout the course of the
fiscal year. The 30-year AAA-rated municipal bond yield, for instance, actually
declined over the course of the fiscal year, from 4.58% to 4.48% on March 31,
2006 (source: Municipal Market Data).

Rising short-term rates, coupled with the long-term rate downward trend, created
a situation that economists typically refer to as a "flattening yield curve,"
meaning that the difference between short- and long-term bond yields grows
smaller across the spectrum of maturities.

In this type of environment, bonds with intermediate maturities -- such as those
in the three- to seven-year maturity range -- frequently underperform. We found
this to be particularly true during the second half of the fiscal year, when the
flattening of the yield curve became more pronounced.

Credit quality among municipal bond issuers generally improved during the fiscal
year, and it was another factor influencing the markets. A result of these
improving credit qualities was an increase in demand for high yield -- or
non-investment grade -- bonds, which performed well. Similarly, among investment
grade municipal bonds, lower-rated securities often outperformed higher-rated
securities by a significant margin on a total return basis.

Q: What other market-related events influenced performance of municipal bond
funds?

A: Issuance of new municipal bonds remained strong during most of the fiscal
year. Supply of new municipal bonds is typically assessed on a calendar year
basis and, for example, supply in calendar year 2005 totaled a record $408
billion (source: Municipal Market Data).

Driving the record issuance was low interest rates, which provided many issuers
with refinancing opportunities. The market's ability to absorb additional supply
was aided by non-traditional buyers (buyers more interested in the relative
valuation of the asset class than the tax-advantaged status of municipal bonds).
As more and more municipal issuers refinanced in 2005, new issuance dropped off.
During the first months of 2006, the rate of new issuance had declined
significantly.

For much of the fiscal year, a preferred strategy in all of our municipal bond
funds was to hold onto bonds purchased in prior fiscal periods, and to depend on
the attractive bond yields that already exist within our Funds. Generally, with
interest rates in decline, it became

                                                                   (continued) 1

increasingly difficult to identify bonds in the marketplace that were more
attractive than our holdings in the portfolio. We believed that selling older
bonds that were purchased with attractive yields would only serve to "rotate
down" the Funds' yields and potentially generate undesirable taxable gains.

Across each of the closed-end municipal bond funds, we adhered to our bottom-up
investment style, which is based on security-by-security analysis and a free
exchange of information among the various members of a deep management team that
includes portfolio managers, credit analysts, and traders. Frequently during the
year, we opted to focus our resources on monitoring the credit of legacy bonds,
which are bonds purchased in prior fiscal periods.

Arizona Municipal Income Fund

Q: What conditions prevailed in the Arizona debt market?

A: Job growth in Arizona continued to accelerate in 2005 and ranked second
nationwide. Employment grew approximately 5.3% in 2005, the most rapid rate of
annual growth since 1998 (source: Bureau of Labor Statistics). Recent job growth
was led by the construction sector, as well as the trade, transportation, and
utilities sectors. As of February 2006, the state's unemployment rate was
hovering at 4.4%, which was well below the national level of 4.8%. While
personal income grew in 2005, it was hampered by job losses in the manufacturing
and information sectors, two of the highest paid sectors in Arizona. As a
result, Arizona personal income remains below national levels at approximately
87% of the U.S. average (source: Moody's Investors Service).

In fiscal 2005, Arizona's tax revenues increased 19.4%, led by strong personal
and corporate income taxes. Arizona's Budget Stabilization Fund totaled $147
million as of June 30, 2005. Arizona's fiscal year 2006 budget totals $8.2
billion and increases base spending by about 7%. The budget includes salary
increases for state workers, tax revisions, and an establishment of a full-day
kindergarten program (source: Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and
the Fiscal Survey of States-National Governor's Association).

Q: How did the Fund perform versus its benchmark and peer group?

A: Arizona Municipal Income Fund returned 3.31%* (at net asset value with all
distributions reinvested), underper-forming both the peer group and the
benchmark. By comparison, the Lipper Other States Municipal Debt Funds gained an
average of 5.08% for the same period. The Fund's benchmark -- the national
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index -- gained 3.81% (source: Lipper).

Q: What strategies affected Fund performance?

A: The Fund underperformed the benchmark due to a lack of exposure to industrial
development revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds (IDC/PCR) over the
12-month period. The IDR/PCR sector includes tobacco bonds, which we have not
invested in as an across-the-board policy in our municipal funds due to the
volatility associated with the sub-sector. The IDR/PCR sector was by far the
best performing segment in the Index, posting a +9.59% return for the period.
When excluding tobacco bonds, the IDR/PCR sector returned only +3.82% over 12
months.

The Fund was also negatively affected by a significant underweighting in
BBB-rated bonds. By policy, there was no exposure to non-investment grade bonds.
These two rating categories outperformed by a considerable margin, posting
returns of 6.99% and 9.12%, respectively. However, as a whole, the Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index returned only 3.81% over the 12-month period.

Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund

Q: What conditions prevailed in the Colorado debt market?

A: After experiencing a sharper economic downturn than the nation in recent
years, Colorado is now recovering at a healthy pace. The state's employment
declines bottomed out in early 2004. In 2005, non-farm payroll employment grew
over 2% even though manufacturing employment declined during that period. This
is largely attributable to growth in construction, healthcare, and education.

As of February 2006, Colorado's unemployment rate was 4.3%, which was below the
national rate (source: Bureau of Labor Statistics). Colorado's tax revenues
increased in recent years, with the growth due to increases in personal income
tax, sales tax, and, most significantly, corporate income tax. Despite this
growth, Colorado's Required Statutory Reserve was drawn down to $198 million in
2005. Voter initiatives, such as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, have limited
Colorado's financial flexibility. In November, Referendum C was approved by
Colorado voters. This allows the state to retain tax revenue collected in excess
of the fiscal years' budget for the next five years, estimated to be $3.7
billion. The Governor's 2006-2007 budget proposes a 4.1% increase over this
year. Budget highlights include increased higher education and human services
spending (source: Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and the Fiscal
Survey of States-National Governor's Association).

Q: How did the Fund perform versus its benchmark and peer group?

A: Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund returned 3.44%* (at net asset value
with all distributions reinvested). By comparison, the Lipper Other States
Municipal Debt Funds returned an average of 5.08% for the same period. The
Fund's benchmark -- the national Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index --
returned 3.81% (source: Lipper).

*  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Substantially all
   dividends are exempt from federal income tax and may be subject to
   alternative minimum tax that applies to certain taxpayers. Capital gains, if
   any, are taxable.

Q: What strategies affected Fund performance?

A: As an insured Fund, we were largely excluded from the industrial development
revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds IDR/PCR sector, which consists
primarily of mid-to-low investment grade bonds. In addition, the industrial
development revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds (IDR/PCR) sector
includes tobacco bonds, which we have not invested in as an across-the-board
policy in our municipal funds due to the volatility associated with this
sub-sector. The IDR/PCR sector was by far the best performing segment in the
Index, posting a +9.59% return for the period. When excluding tobacco bonds, the
IDR/PCR sector returned only +3.82% over 12 months.

The Fund underperformed the Lipper Peer Group because of our 100% investment in
insured or equivalent AAA-rated bonds, though it should be noted that the Fund's
Peer Group is not strictly an insured universe. The Fund was underweighted
compared to the benchmark in BBB-rated and non-insured bonds. Over this 12-month
period in the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, AAA-rated bonds returned just 3.65%.
The A-rated bonds returned 4.19%, BBB-rated bonds returned 6.99%, and
non-investment grade bonds posted a 9.12% return.

Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund

Q: What conditions prevailed in the Florida debt market?

A: Florida ranks as the fourth most populous state in the nation and remains one
of the nation's fastest growing states. This year showed that Florida's economy
continues to be one of the strongest in the country, with rapid job and income
growth. Despite another crippling hurricane season, which is magnified by
Florida's reliance on tourism, Florida's job growth remained robust with
non-farm payroll increasing 2.1% in 2005. The state's unemployment rate remains
very low compared to the national average, at a mere 3.2% as of February 2006
(source: Bureau of Labor Statistics).


                                                                   (continued) 3

Sales and use tax revenues, which account for approximately 60% of all taxes,
grew 12% for fiscal 2005. At $988 million, Florida has one of the highest
balances of any state in its budget stabilization fund. The $70.8 billion fiscal
2006 budget includes a 25% increase in the capital outlay budget, an economic
development plan, funding of reserves, and $1.5 billion in tax cuts. The tax
cuts proposed include the elimination of the intangibles tax and school property
tax savings (source: Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and the
Fiscal Survey of States-National Governor's Association).

Q: How did the Fund perform versus its benchmark and peer group?

A: Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund returned 2.76%* (at net asset value
with all distributions reinvested). By comparison, the Lipper Florida Municipal
Debt Funds gained an average of 4.84% for the same period. The Fund's benchmark
- -- the national Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index -- returned 3.81% (source:
Lipper).

Q: What strategies affected Fund performance?

A: As an insured Fund, we were largely excluded from the industrial development
revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds (IDR/PCR) sector, which is
populated with mid-to-low investment grade bonds. In addition, the IDR/PCR
sector includes tobacco bonds, which we have not invested in as an
across-the-board policy in our municipal funds due to the volatility associated
with this sub-sector. The IDR/PCR sector was by far the best performing segment
in the Index, posting a +9.59% return for the period. When excluding tobacco
bonds, the IDR/PCR sector returned only +3.82% over 12 months.

The Fund underperformed the Lipper Peer Group because of our 100% investment in
insured or equivalent AAA-rated bonds, though it should be noted that the Fund's
Peer Group is not strictly an insured universe. The Fund was underweighted
compared to the benchmark in BBB-rated and non-insured bonds. Over this 12-month
period in the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, AAA-rated bonds returned
just 3.65%, while A-rated bonds returned 4.19%, BBB-rated bonds returned 6.99%,
and non-investment grade bonds posted a 9.12% return.

Minnesota's Municipal Income Fund II

Q: What conditions prevailed in the Minnesota debt market?

A: Minnesota's new issuance totaled $7.6 billion in 2005 -- a 20% increase over
2004 (source: Municipal Market Data). Minnesota continues to recover from the
2001 recession, which resulted from its manufacturing sector concentration. The
state has shown steady demographic trends, high personal income levels, and low
unemployment (source: Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and the
Fiscal Survey of States-National Governor's Association). While Minnesota's
non-farm payroll continues to grow, it is now growing at a slower pace than the
national average. Employment increased 1.04% in 2005 with gains in the services,
construction, and manufacturing sectors (source: Bureau of Labor Statistics).
However, Minnesota's unemployment rate remains below national levels at 4.4%. In
2005, tax revenues increased 7.7% due to double-digit growth in personal income
tax revenues.

Q: How did the Fund perform versus its benchmark and peer group?

A: Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II returned 4.69%* (at net asset value with
all distributions reinvested). Lipper recently moved the Fund into its Other
States Municipal Debt peer group, which averaged a 5.08% gain during the year.
The Lipper Other States category includes funds from other states, but its
average may provide a better comparison than the now-closed Minnesota category
that included just two other funds. The Fund's benchmark -- the national Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index -- gained 3.81% (source: Lipper).

Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds


Q: What strategies affected Fund performance?

A: One of the reasons the Fund underperformed other Minnesota closed-end funds
was its underweighting in industrial development revenue bonds and pollution
control revenue bonds (IDR/PCR) over the 12-month period. The IDR/PCR sector was
by far the best performing segment in the Lehman Index, with a 9.59% return over
the 12-month period. The IDR/PCR sector includes tobacco bonds, in which, as
part of our management policy, we have chosen not to invest. Excluding tobacco
bonds, the IDR/PCR sector returned only 3.82% over the 12-months.

The Fund was also negatively affected by its weighting in pre-refunded bonds,
which at times during the year accounted for as much as 20% of the Fund's total
assets. When a bond becomes pre-refunded, a new bond is issued, and the proceeds
are placed in escrow to be invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The proceeds
generated are then used to pay the principal and interest on the pre-refunded
bond. As such, these bonds typically receive the highest credit ratings and
benefit from a price boost when they initially become pre-refunded. Because of
their short-to-intermediate maturities, the price performance of this group was
hurt during the 12-month period by the flattening of the yield curve, with
shorter rates rising and longer rates remaining more stable.

The Fund also experienced a number of calls on seasoned bonds with higher
coupons and attractive embedded yields during the 12-month period. As portfolio
managers, we must decide whether to sell these bonds early, forfeit the higher
interest income, and realize a capital gain in order to seek better price
performance. By holding on to the bonds, our strategy was often to let them
mature or be called by the issuer. This generally affords us the opportunity to
collect high income as long as possible while minimizing realized capital gains
in the portfolios. In some environments, however, it does impede total return
performance.

(1)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
     on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day
     of each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed
     for the purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained
     under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment
     return based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return
     based on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount
     or a decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value
     from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment
     return based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return
     based on market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount
     or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value
     from the beginning to the end of such periods.

(2)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders.

(3)  Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
     shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common
     shareholders.

(1)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
     on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day
     of each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed
     for the purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained
     under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment
     return based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return
     based on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount
     or a decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value
     from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment
     return based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return
     based on market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount
     or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value
     from the beginning to the end of such periods.

Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds
March 31, 2006

Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal
Fund"); Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.
("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund") and Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal
Income Fund II, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund II") are organized as Minnesota
corporations and Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund
("Florida Insured Municipal Fund") is organized as a Massachusetts Business
Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and collectively as the "Funds"). Arizona
Municipal Fund, Florida Insured Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund II
are considered diversified closed-end management investment companies and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund is considered a non-diversified closed-end
management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Funds' common shares trade on the American Stock Exchange. The
Funds' preferred shares are traded privately through a remarketing agent.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide high current income exempt
from federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. Significant Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by the Funds.

Security Valuation - Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of each Fund's Board of
Directors/Trustees. In determining whether market quotations are readily
available or fair valuation will be used, various factors will be taken into
consideration, such as market closures, aftermarket trading or significant
events after local market trading (e.g., government actions or pronouncements,
trading volume or volatility on markets, exchanges among dealers, or news
events).

Federal Income Taxes - Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Other - Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments(R) Family
of Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of average net assets.
Management fees and some other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions
are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date) for
financial reporting purposes. Costs used in calculating realized gains and
losses on the sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities
sold. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums
are amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities.
Each Fund declares and pays dividends from net investment income monthly and
distributions from net realized gain on investments, if any, annually. In
addition, in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, the Funds may declare special year-end dividend and capital
gains distributions during November or December to shareholders of record on a
date in such month. Such distributions, if received by shareholders by January
31, are deemed to have been paid by the Funds and received by shareholders on
the earlier of the date paid or December 31 of the prior year.

The Funds receive earnings credits from their custodian when positive cash
balances are maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. The expense paid
under the above arrangement is included in custodian fees on the Statements of
Operations with the corresponding expense offset shown as "expense paid
indirectly."


                                                                  (continued) 27

2. Investment Management, Administration Agreements and Other Transactions with
Affiliates

In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%,
which is calculated daily based on the average weekly net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

Delaware Service Company, Inc. (DSC), an affiliate of DMC, provides accounting
and administration services. Effective May 19, 2005, the Funds pay DSC a monthly
fee computed at the annual rate of 0.04% of the Funds' average daily net assets
for accounting and administration services. Prior to May 19, 2005, the Funds
paid DSC a monthly fee based on average net assets subject to certain minimums
for accounting and administration services.

At March 31, 2006, each Fund had liabilities payable to affiliates as follows:

The differences between book basis and tax basis components of net assets are
primarily attributable to tax deferral of losses on wash sales and tax treatment
of market discount on debt instruments.

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the
tax character of permanent book/tax differences. Reclassifications are primarily
due to tax treatment of dividends and distributions and market discount on
certain debt instruments. Results of operations and net assets were not affected
by these reclassifications. For the year ended March 31, 2006, the Funds
recorded the following reclassifications.

amount of $0.01 par value preferred shared authorized. On May 14, 1993, Arizona
Municipal Fund and Florida Insured Municipal Fund issued 500 and 400 preferred
shares, respectively. Also on that date, Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued 600
Series A and 600 Series B preferred shares. On September 23, 1993, Colorado
Insured Municipal Fund issued 800 preferred shares. The preferred shares of each
Fund have a liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

In connection with the reorganizations described in Note 6 below, shareholders
of Minnesota Municipal Fund II approved amendments to its charter to create two
new series to absorb the preferred stock of Minnesota Municipal Fund and
Minnesota Municipal Fund III. These new series have identical rights and
preferences (including liquidation rights) in all material respects to the
preferred shares of Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III,
and are substantially similar to the Series A and B preferred shares of
Minnesota Municipal Fund II with respect to their preferences, voting powers,
restrictions, limitation as to dividends, qualifications, liquidation rights,
and term and conditions of redemption.

Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued 400 Series C Preferred Shares to preferred
shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund in exchange for that Fund's preferred
shares and 300 Series D Preferred Shares to preferred shareholders of Minnesota
Municipal Fund III in exchange for that Fund's preferred shares at the close of
the reorganization on February 24, 2006.

Dividends for the outstanding preferred shares of each Fund are cumulative at a
rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the year ended March 31, 2006 as
follows:

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (formerly Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.), and
Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. (Colorado Insured Municipal Fund
only), as the remarketing agents, receive an annual fee from each of the Funds
of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred stock outstanding.

5. Capital Stock (continued)

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant to Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassificiation as a closed-end
investment company or (c) changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. Fund Reorganizations

At the close of business on February 24, 2006, Minnesota Municipal Fund II
acquired substantially all of the assets of Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund") and Delaware
Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund
III"), each pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition (the
"Reorganizations"). The common shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund and
Minnesota Municipal Fund III each received common shares of Minnesota Municipal
Fund II equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective shares prior
to the Reorganization. The preferred shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund
and Minnesota Municipal Fund III received the same number of Series C and Series
D preferred shares, respectively, of Minnesota Municipal Fund II as they held in
their respective funds prior to the Reorganization (see Note 5). The
Reorganizations were treated as non-taxable events and, accordingly, Minnesota
Municipal Fund II's basis in the securities acquired reflected the historical
cost basis as of the date of transfer. The net assets, net unrealized
appreciation and accumulated net realized gain (loss) of Minnesota Municipal
Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III as of the close of business on February
24, 2006, were as follows:

</TABLE>


The net assets of Minnesota Municipal Fund II prior to the Reorganizations were
$108,531,274. The combined net assets of Minnesota Municipal Fund II after the
Reorganization were $172,175,299.

Minnesota Municipal Fund II will continue to trade and to be listed on the
American Stock Exchange. Beginning on February 27, 2006 and going forward,
however, Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III will no
longer trade or be listed on the American Stock Exchange, and their corporate
existence will be liquidated and dissolved. In January 2007, shareholders of
Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III will receive Form
1099-DIV that will report the amount and character of each Fund's distributions
paid in calendar year 2006.

Common and preferred shares of Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued to
shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III in
connection with the Reorganizations were as follows:

</TABLE>

7. Credit and Market Risk

The Funds use leverage in the form of preferred shares. Leveraging may result in
a higher degree of volatility because each Fund's net asset value could be more
sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates and changes in market
value of portfolio securities attributable to the leverage.

The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the states, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels
of supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment
for their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are identified on the Statements of Net Assets.


                                                                  (continued) 31

Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds

7. Credit and Market Risk (continued)

Each Fund may invest in advanced refunded bonds, escrow secured bonds or
defeased bonds. Under current federal tax laws and regulations, state and local
government borrowers are permitted to refinance outstanding bonds by issuing new
bonds. The issuer refinances the outstanding debt to either reduce interest
costs or to remove or alter restrictive covenants imposed by the bonds being
refinanced. A refunding transaction where the municipal securities are being
refunded within 90 days from the issuance of the refunding issue is known as a
"current refunding." Advance refunded bonds are bonds in which the refunded bond
issue remains outstanding for more than 90 days following the issuance of the
refunding issue. In an advance refunding, the issuer will use the proceeds of a
new bond issue to purchase high grade interest bearing debt securities which are
then deposited in an irrevocable escrow account held by an escrow agent to
secure all future payments of principal and interest and bond premium of the
advance refunded bond. Bonds are "escrowed to maturity" when the proceeds of the
refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for investment sufficient to
pay all of the principal and interest on the original interest payment and
maturity dates. Bonds are considered "pre-refunded" when the refunding issue's
proceeds are escrowed only until a permitted call date or dates on the refunded
issue with the refunded issue being redeemed at that time, including any
required premium. Bonds become "defeased" when the rights and interests of the
bondholders and of their lien on the pledged revenues or other security under
the terms of the bond contract are substituted with an alternative source of
revenues (the escrow securities) sufficient to meet payments of principal and
interest to maturity or to the first call dates. Escrowed secured bonds will
often receive a rating of AAA from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
Poor's Ratings Group, and/or Fitch due to the strong credit quality of the
escrow securities and the irrevocable nature of the escrow deposit agreement.

Each Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in illiquid securities, which
may include securities with contractual restrictions on resale, securities
exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and other securities which may not be readily marketable. The relative
illiquidity of these securities may impair each Fund from disposing of them in a
timely manner and at a fair price when it is necessary or desirable to do so.
While maintaining oversight, each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has
delegated to DMC the day-to-day functions of determining whether individual
securities are liquid for purposes of each Fund's limitation on investments in
illiquid assets. At March 31, 2006, there were no Rule 144A securities and no
securities have been determined to be illiquid under the Funds' Liquidity
Procedures.

8. Contractual Obligations

The Funds enter into contracts in the normal course of business that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts. Management has reviewed the Funds' existing
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9. Tax Information (Unaudited)

The information set forth below is for each Fund's fiscal year as required by
federal laws. Shareholders, however, must report distributions on a calendar
year basis for income tax purposes, which may include distributions for portions
of two fiscal years of a fund. Accordingly, the information needed by
shareholders for income tax purposes will be sent to them in January of each
year. Please consult your tax advisor for proper treatment of this information.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, each Fund designates distributions
paid during the year as follows:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of Delaware
Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Delaware Investments Colorado
Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund and Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund
II, Inc. (the "Funds"), as of March 31, 2006, and the related statements of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.

We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of March 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
respective Funds at March 31, 2006, the results of their operations for the year
then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and their financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Board of trustees/directors and officers addendum


A mutual fund is governed by a Board of Trustees/Directors ("Trustees"), which
has oversight responsibility for the management of a fund's business affairs.
Trustees establish procedures and oversee and review the performance of the
investment manager, the distributor and others who perform services for the
fund. The independent fund trustees, in particular, are advocates for
shareholder interests. Each trustee has served in that capacity since he or she
was elected to or appointed to the Board of Trustees, and will continue to serve
until his or her retirement or the election of a new trustee in his or her
place. The following is a list of the Trustees and Officers with certain
background and related information.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert

        The registrant's Board of Trustees/Directors has determined that each

expert, as defined below. For purposes of this item, an "audit committee
financial expert" is a person who has the following attributes:

        b. The ability to assess the general application of such principles in
connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves;

        c. Experience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial

experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities;

        d. An understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting; and

        e. An understanding of audit committee functions.

An "audit committee financial expert" shall have acquired such attributes

or any committee thereof, accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory
or other compensatory fee from the issuer; or (ii) be an "interested person" of

         The Pre-Approval Policy requires the registrant's independent auditors
to report to the Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all
services initiated since the last such report was rendered, including those
services authorized by the Pre-Approval Policy.

         (f) Not applicable.

         (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's independent
auditors for services rendered to the registrant and to its investment adviser
and other service providers under common control with the adviser were $199,060
and $235,079 for the registrant's fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March
31, 2005, respectively.

                                                                              42

         (h) In connection with its selection of the independent auditors, the
registrant's Audit Committee has considered the independent auditors' provision
of non-audit services to the registrant's investment adviser and other service
providers under common control with the adviser that were not required to be
pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. The Audit
Committee has determined that the independent auditors' provision of these
services is compatible with maintaining the auditors' independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

         The registrant has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee
established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  The members of the registrant's Audit Committee are Thomas L.
Bennett, Thomas F. Madison, Janet L. Yeomans and J. Richard Zecher.

Item 6.  Schedule of Investments

         Included as part of report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this
Form N-CSR.

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies

         The registrant has formally delegated to its investment adviser (the
"Adviser") the ability to make all proxy voting decisions in relation to
portfolio securities held by the registrant. If and when proxies need to be
voted on behalf of the registrant, the Adviser will vote such proxies pursuant
to its Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures (the "Procedures"). The Adviser has
established a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") which is responsible for
overseeing the Adviser's proxy voting process for the registrant. One of the
main responsibilities of the Committee is to review and approve the Procedures
to ensure that the Procedures are designed to allow the Adviser to vote proxies
in a manner consistent with the goal of voting in the best interests of the
registrant.

         In order to facilitate the actual process of voting proxies, the
Adviser has contracted with Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") to
analyze proxy statements on behalf of the registrant and other Adviser clients
and vote proxies generally in accordance with the Procedures. The Committee is
responsible for overseeing ISS's proxy voting activities. If a proxy has been
voted for the registrant, ISS will create a record of the vote. By no later than
August 31 of each year, information (if any) regarding how the registrant voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recently disclosed
12-month period ended June 30 is available without charge (i) through the
registrant's website at http://www.delawareinvestments.com; and (ii) on the
Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

         The Procedures contain a general guideline that recommendations of
company management on an issue (particularly routine issues) should be given a
fair amount of weight in determining how proxy issues should be voted. However,
the Adviser will normally vote against management's position when it runs
counter to its specific Proxy Voting Guidelines (the "Guidelines"), and the
Adviser will also vote against management's recommendation when it believes that
such position is not in the best interests of the registrant.

         As stated above, the Procedures also list specific Guidelines on how to
vote proxies on behalf of the registrant. Some examples of the Guidelines are as
follows: (i) generally vote for shareholder proposals asking that a majority or
more of directors be independent; (ii) generally vote against proposals to
require a supermajority shareholder vote; (iii) votes on mergers and
acquisitions should be considered on a case-by-case basis, determining whether
the transaction enhances shareholder value; (iv) generally vote against
proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior voting rights; (v)
generally vote re-incorporation proposals on a case-by-case basis; (vi) votes
with respect to equity-based compensation plans are generally determined on a
case-by-case basis; and (vii) generally vote for proposals requesting reports on
the level of greenhouse gas emissions from a company's operations and products.

         Because the registrant has delegated proxy voting to the Adviser, the
registrant is not expected to encounter any conflict of interest issues
regarding proxy voting and therefore does not have procedures regarding this
matter. However, the Adviser does have a section in its Procedures that
addresses the possibility of conflicts of interest. Most proxies which the
Adviser receives on behalf of the registrant are voted by ISS in accordance with
the Procedures. Because almost all registrant proxies are voted by ISS pursuant
to the pre-determined Procedures, it normally will not be necessary for the
Adviser to make an actual determination of how to vote a particular proxy,
thereby largely eliminating conflicts of interest for the Adviser during the
proxy voting process. In the very limited instances where the Adviser is
considering voting a

43

proxy contrary to ISS's recommendation, the Committee will first assess the
issue to see if there is any possible conflict of interest involving the Adviser
or affiliated persons of the Adviser. If a member of the Committee has actual
knowledge of a conflict of interest, the Committee will normally use another
independent third party to do additional research on the particular proxy issue
in order to make a recommendation to the Committee on how to vote the proxy in
the best interests of the registrant. The Committee will then review the proxy
voting materials and recommendation provided by ISS and the independent third
party to determine how to vote the issue in a manner which the Committee
believes is consistent with the Procedures and in the best interests of the
registrant.
