               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular monthly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".

   The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

DEAR FELLOW ZTR SHAREHOLDER:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for the
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the six-months ended June 30, 2010.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value declined 5.63% for the quarter
ended June 30, 2010, including $0.100 in reinvested distributions. During the
same period, the Fund's Composite Index declined 3.73% including reinvested
dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the quarter was approximately 38% in
bonds and 39% in equities.

   For the six-months ended June 30, 2010, the Fund's net asset value fell
4.07%, including $0.202 in reinvested distributions. During the same period,
the Fund's Composite Index declined 0.53% including reinvested dividends. The
Fund's average exposure for the first half was approximately 39% in bonds and
40% in equities.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.
                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

                                 EQUITY MARKET

   The second quarter and first half of 2010 were not happy times for stock
market investors. Closing at 9,774 on June 30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
declined 10%/(1)/ for the quarter, its first quarterly drop since the first
three months of 2009. The Dow ended down 12.8%/(1) /from its 2010 high of April
26th and 31%/(1)/ below its record high close in October 2007. However, it was
still up 49%/(1)/ from its record low of 6,547 on March 9, 2006. For the first
half the Dow dipped 6.27 %,/(1)/ or 1,082 points, to a new low for the year.

   The other major indexes did even more poorly. The S&P 500(R) Index fell
12%/(1)/ for the quarter, its worst quarterly performance since the first three
months of 2008. Ending at 1,030, the index dropped 7.5%/(1)/ for the year thus
far. The NASDAQ Composite(R) Index performed similarly, slipping 12%/(1)/ for
the quarter, and, closing at 2,109, was off 7.0%/(1)/ for the half.

   There was also little to cheer about the performance of the international
markets for the year to date. The Dow Jones Global Index closed down 9.7%/(1)/,
The STOXX Europe 600 fell 3.9%/(1)/, with the British FTSE 100 down 9.2%/(1)/.
The German DAX, the best performer, gained 0.1%/(1)/. The Dow Jones
Asia-Pacific Index was off 5.2%/(1)/ with China's Shanghai Composite slumping
26.8%/(1)/ to its lowest level in nearly 15 months. Japan's Nikkei Stock
Average fell 11.0%/(1)/ to its lowest point since November 30, 2009.

   Stating that "inflation is likely to be subdued for some time," the Federal
Reserve (the "FED") announced at its June meeting that it will hold

 Managed Distribution Plan: The Fund has a policy to distribute 10% of its net
 asset value annually. Please see inside the front cover for more information.

short-term interest rates at near zero "for an extended period." While noting
that "the economic recovery recently is proceeding and that the labor market is
improving gradually," it added that "financial conditions have become less
supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments
abroad." The Fed's "comfort zone" on inflation is 1% to 2% and current figures
are well within that range.

   The Labor Department reported that, excluding volatile food and energy
prices, consumer prices rose only 0.1% in May. Compared to a year ago, the
index has risen just 0.9%, the smallest gain since 1966. Meanwhile, the
producer price index, which reflects wholesale prices, fell 0.3% in May from
April. Even after rising an inflation- adjusted 0.5% in May, average hourly
earnings for workers were unchanged from last year's levels.

   The Labor Department reported that private sector employment in June gained
83,000 jobs, almost double the amount in May but far below the nearly 200,000
jobs added in March and April. The unemployment rate declined to 9.5% in June
from 9.7% in May largely because 652,000 jobless left the labor force.

   One industry that is not adding jobs is housing, a key factor in the
economy. The Commerce Department reported that construction starts on single
family homes fell 17.2% in May to an annual rate of 469,000, the lowest level
in a year. The agency also reported that home sales in May plunged 32.7% from
April to a seasonally-adjusted rate of 300,000, marking a decline of 18.3% from
a year ago and a record low. Sales of existing homes slipped 2.2% in April.

   Momentum in manufacturing is also slowing. The Institute for Supply
Management ("ISM") reported that its manufacturing index dipped to 56.2 in June
from 59.7 in May, reflecting a decline in new orders, production and exports.
ISM also reported that its index for the service industry weakened, dipping to
53.8 in June from 55.4 in May. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.

   The same story holds true for factory orders. The Commerce Department said
that orders for manufactured goods slipped 1.4% in May, the biggest drop since
March of last year. In April orders rose 1%. Excluding transportation, new
orders declined by 0.6%.

   With the economic news so disappointing, it is no surprise that consumer
confidence has tumbled after improving for three straight months. The
Conference Board reported that its Consumer Confidence Index sank almost 10
points in June to 52.9 from a revised 62.7 in May. The June fall-off was the
biggest drop since February when the index slid 10 points.

   Economic activity in the first quarter was not as strong as originally
reported. The growth of gross domestic product was revised finally from 3.0% to
2.75%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The only quarter that
expanded over 3% since the recession onset was the fourth quarter of 2009.
Mostly responsible for the latest decline was the fact that personal
consumption spending comprised only 2.13% of GDP growth instead of 2.42% as
originally forecast.

   U.S. sales overseas weakened in April, the last month for which figures are
available. The Commerce Department reported that exports dropped 0.7% to $148.8
billion while imports dipped 0.4% to $189.1 billion. As a result, the trade
deficit widened by 0.75% in April to $40.3 billion, the highest level in
sixteen months.

   There was little change in the level of initial public offerings (IPO's)
during the second quarter of 2010. In the U.S., 29 companies went public,
raising $4 billion, compared with 22 IPO's that brought in $3.7 billion in the
first quarter, according to Dealogic. The most recent figures are a
considerable improvement over the second quarter of 2009 which saw only 8
offerings that raised $1 billion. Globally, 295 IPO's raised $42 billion in the
second quarter compared with 274 that raised $51.5 billion in the first
quarter, an 18% drop in dollar volume.

   World-wide mergers and acquisitions increased during the second quarter.
There were 10,509 deals valued at $610.7 billion, an increase of 11% over the
deal value of $549.6 billion in the second quarter of 2009. However deal volume
is down approximately 58% from the second quarter of 2007, just before the
market collapsed.

   Despite the market's volatility, analysts expect strong company earnings
this year. Recent estimates put the S&P 500 earnings per share at $85.26 for
2010, a return to 2007 levels, according to Thomson Reuters. For 2011, analysts
forecast earnings of $96.43 a share, a 17.5% increase over 2010. If attained,
it would top the all-time record earnings of $88.18 in 2006.

   Dividend payments are also increasing. So far this year 136 companies in the
S&P 500 have either boosted payments or initiated dividends, raising outlays by
$11 billion. Only two companies cut or suspended dividends. Last year there
were 78 reductions or suspensions, reducing returns to shareholders by a record
$37 billion. Howard Silverblatt, senior S&P analyst, predicts a 5.6% increase
in 2010 earnings over last year, with a surge around the year-end.
Non-financial companies in the S&P 500 had a record $837 billion in cash at the
end of the first quarter, up from $665 billion a year earlier.

   Bloomberg News reported that, based on the earnings estimates, stocks in the
S&P 500 Index were trading at a price/earnings ratio of 12.69 on June 30, 2010,
compared with 15.01 at the end of March 31 and 15.53 on June 30, last year. For
trailing 12-month earnings, the P/Es were 14.92, 26.80 and 15.95, respectively.
Since the recent P/E reading is somewhat below the historical average of 14.9
since 1984, the current valuations appear to be fairly priced.

   As far as the stock market outlook is concerned, advisors continued to be
far more optimistic than individual investors. Surveyed by Investors
Intelligence on June 30, advisors stood at 41% bulls and 33% bears. This
compares with a survey by the American Institute of Individual Investors that
tallied 25% bulls and 42% bears. The number of bullish investors was the lowest
since November 6th, 2009. Confirming these findings, the Investment Company
Institute reported that private investors withdrew more money from stocks than
they put in from 2007 through 2009, the first three-year period of net
withdrawals since 1979-1981. This year there were net investments in the first
three months and net withdrawals in May.

   More recently, the divergence of views between advisors and investors has
narrowed, with both groups evenly divided about the outlook. The advisors moved
to 33% bulls and 35% bears, while the investors came to 39% bulls and 38% bears.

   The Fund's market indicators offer a mixed picture, with pockets of
significant pessimism tempering the optimism. After improving somewhat during
the second quarter, our sentiment indicators are moderately positive. With the
Dow recovering only slightly after ending the quarter down nearly 13% from its
2010 peak, our tape indicators are somewhat negative. On the positive side,
there are our monetary indicators, which reflect the Fed's stand on interest
rates and the absence of inflation. Consequently, our present market stance is
neutral.

                                  BOND MARKET

   The second quarter of 2010 was a very strong period for U.S. Treasuries. It
saw yields of the benchmark 10-year note decline from 3.83% at the beginning of
the quarter to 2.93% on June 30. The lower yields were driven by weak economic
data along with falling stock prices and the Greek crisis. These factors led to
a "flight to safety" to U.S. Treasury bonds across the yield curve.

   During the quarter, yields dropped 90 basis points in the 10-year note,
leading to sharply higher bond prices across the maturity spectrum. Concern
over the European debt situation induced global investors to turn to the
apparent safety of Treasury bonds. Adding to the interest in bonds were
indications that the young "recovery" was sputtering.

   Private industry job creation was surprisingly weak, as were retail sales,
manufacturing and housing data. Given the massive U.S. stimulus program, it is
remarkable that the 10-year note hit nearly generational lows, falling below 3%
during the quarter.


The preceding information is the opinion of portfolio management. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee that
market forecasts will be realized.

For information regarding the indexes cited, and key investment terms used in
this report see page 7.

As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. As such, this Fund's share value may
decline substantially and it is possible to lose a significant portion of your
principal when interest rates rise.


   Because the duration of our bond portfolio was lower than that of most bond
funds, we participated somewhat less in the advance. While our holdings of
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and corporate bonds did help
performance, they did not move sharply higher than plain vanilla Treasury bonds.

   The Fund's bond model remains relatively cautious because several indicators
are still somewhat negative. As always, we will remain flexible, ready to alter
our exposure as warranted when and if indicators and conditions change.

              Sincerely,

              /s/Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

/(1)/ Please note that the tax status of our distributions is determined at the
      end of the taxable year. However, based on interim data as of June 30,
      2010, we estimate 15% of the distributions will represent net investment
      income, 24% will represent excess gain distributions which are taxed as
      ordinary income and 61% will represent return of capital. Also refer to
      the inside front cover for the Managed Distribution Plan.

(1)Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the
   Fund's common stock at the opening NYSE share price on the first business
   day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
   investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

   Without this effect, the total investment return would have been (13.82)%.

(7)NAV return is calculated using the opening Net Asset Value price of the

(10)Please note that the tax status of our distributions is determined at the
    end of the taxable year. However, based on interim data as of June 30,
    2010, we estimate 15% of the distributions will represent net investment
    income, 24% will represent excess gain distributions which are taxed as
    ordinary income and 61% will represent return of capital. Also refer to the
    inside front cover for the Managed Distribution Plan.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 JUNE 30, 2010
                                  (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's investment objective is to seek the
highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and those differences could be significant.

  A. SECURITY VALUATION:

   The Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.

   .   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

   .   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

   .   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
       (including the Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
       investments)

   A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Fund's major
categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis is as follows:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price and are categorized as Level
1 in the hierarchy. Restricted equity securities and private placements that
are not widely traded, are illiquid or are internally fair valued by the
advisor, are generally categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

   Certain foreign securities may be fair valued in cases where closing prices
are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available
market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in the U.S.
securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur between
the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally traded)
and the time that the Fund

                                      19

<PAGE>


calculates its net asset value (generally, the close of the NYSE) that may
impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets. In such cases
the Fund fair values foreign securities using an external pricing service which
considers the correlation of the trading patterns of the foreign security to
the intraday trading in the U.S. markets for investments such as American
depositary receipts, financial futures, exchange-traded funds, and certain
indexes as well as prices for similar securities. Such fair valuations are
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Because the frequency of significant
events is not predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may
occur on a frequent basis.

   Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on
evaluated quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For most bond types, the pricing service
utilizes matrix pricing which considers yield or price of bonds of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, current cash flows, type, and current day trade
information, as well as dealer supplied prices. These valuations are generally
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Structured debt instruments also
incorporate collateral analysis and utilize cash flow models for valuation and
are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Pricing services do not
provide pricing for all securities and therefore dealer supplied prices are
utilized representing indicative bids based on pricing models used by market
makers in the security and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. Debt securities that are not widely traded, are illiquid, or are
internally fair valued by the advisor are generally categorized as Level 3 in
the hierarchy.

   Listed derivatives that are actively traded are valued based on quoted
prices from the exchange and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Over
the counter (OTC) derivative contracts, which include forward currency
contracts and equity linked instruments, do not require material subjectivity
as pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets and are categorized
as Level 2 in the hierarchy.

   Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset
value determined as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) each business day and are categorized as
Level 1 in the hierarchy.

   Short-term Notes having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market.

   A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's net assets by each major
security type is disclosed at the end of the Schedule of Investments for the
Fund. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

  B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. INCOME TAXES:

   The Fund is treated as a separate taxable entity. It is the policy of the
Fund to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes
has been made.

                                      20

<PAGE>



   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   The Fund has adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for and
disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions, which requires the Fund to
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Fund has
determined that there was no effect on the financial statements from the
adoption of this authoritative guidance. The Fund files tax returns as
prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. In the
normal course of business, the Funds are subject to examination by federal,
state and local jurisdictions, where applicable. As of June 30, 2010, the tax
years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under
the statute of limitations is from the year 2006 forward (with limited
exceptions).

  D. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest.

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10 percent of the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent
earnings from net investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary,
return of capital. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the
Fund's investment performance from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution
Plan.

  E. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters

exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At June 30, 2010, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744 shares
are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the periods ended June 30, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, there were no shares issued pursuant to the Plan.

NOTE 7 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 8 -- REGULATORY EXAMS

   Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.

   There are currently no such matters which the Company believes will be
material to these financial statements.

NOTE 9 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION

appreciation (depreciation) of securities held by the Fund were as follows:

     $435,007        $22,470            $(27,575)            $(5,105)

   The Fund has $9,584 of capital loss carryovers, expiring in 2017, which may
be used to offset future capital gains. The Fund may not realize the benefit of
these losses to the extent it does not realize gains on investments prior to
the expiration of the capital loss carryovers. In addition, under certain
conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of these losses to the extent that
distributions to shareholders

                                      23

exceed required distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue
Code. Shareholders may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.

NOTE 10 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT EVALUATIONS

                    BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF
             INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND SERVICING AGREEMENT

   Pursuant to Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "1940 Act"), the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Zweig Total
Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment advisory agreement and are not
"interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent
Directors"), are required to annually review and re-approve the terms of the
Fund's existing investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with
Zweig Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") and the servicing agreement (the "Servicing
Agreement") between the Adviser and Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser")
(collectively, the "Agreements"). In this regard, the Board reviewed and
re-approved, during the most recent six month period covered by this report,
the Agreements.

   More specifically, at a meeting held on February 8-9, 2010, the Board,
including the Independent Directors, considered the factors and reached the
conclusions described below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the
Sub-Adviser and the re-approval of the Agreements.

   1. Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. The Independent Directors
considered the nature, extent and quality of the services performed by the
Adviser and the Sub-Adviser including portfolio management, supervision of Fund
operations and compliance and regulatory filings and disclosures to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund
legal issues, assisting the Directors in that capacity and other services. The
Independent Directors concluded that the services are extensive in nature and
that the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser delivered an acceptable level of service.

   2. Investment Performance of the Fund and Adviser. The Independent Directors
considered the investment performance for the Fund over various periods of time
as compared to their respective Lipper, Inc. performance groups and performance
universe, and concluded that the Adviser was delivering acceptable performance
results consistent with the long-term investment strategies being pursued by
the Fund. The Independent Directors also considered the performance of the
portfolios of other Virtus equity mutual funds now being managed by the Fund's
portfolio managers and found that performance to be consistent with the
performance being achieved by the Fund's equity portfolios.

   3. Costs of Services and Profits Realized by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser.

   (a) Costs of Services to the Fund: Fees and Expenses. The Independent
Directors considered the Fund's management fee rate and expense ratios relative
to the Fund's Lipper, Inc. expense group. The Independent Directors concluded
that those fees are acceptable based upon the qualifications, experience,
reputation and performance of the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser. The Independent
Directors also concluded that the expense ratio of the Fund was within an
acceptable range relative to its Lipper, Inc. expense group.

   (b) Profitability and Costs of Services to Adviser and Sub-Adviser. The
Independent Directors considered the Adviser's and Sub-Adviser's overall
profitability and costs. The Independent Directors also considered whether the
amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit. The Independent Directors
concluded that the Adviser's and the Sub-Adviser's profitability was at an
acceptable level in light of the quality of the services being provided to the
Fund.

                                      25

<PAGE>



   4. Extent of Economies of Scale as the Fund Grows. The Independent Directors
considered whether there have been economies of scale with respect to the
management of the Fund and whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from
any economies of scale. The Independent Directors noted that economies of scale
may develop for certain funds as their assets increase and their fund-level
expenses decline as a percentage of assets, but that closed-end funds such as
the Fund typically do not have the ability to substantially increase their
asset base as do open-end funds. The Independent Directors concluded that the
Fund has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale.

   5. Whether Fee Levels Reflect Economies of Scale. The Independent Directors
also considered whether the management fee rate is reasonable in relation to
the asset size of the Fund and any economies of scale that may exist, and
concluded that, given the Fund's closed-end structure, it was. At the same
time, the Directors agreed that it would be appropriate to monitor this issue
in the event that the assets of the Fund were to increase substantially via a
rights offering or some other means.

   6. Other Relevant Considerations.

   (a) Adviser Personnel and Methods. The Independent Directors considered the
size, education and experience of the Adviser's and Sub-Adviser's staff, their
fundamental research capabilities and approach to recruiting, training and
retaining portfolio managers and other research and management personnel, and
concluded that in each of these areas they were structured in such a way to
support the level of services being provided to the Fund.

   (b) Other Benefits to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. The Independent Directors
also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits received
by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser and their respective affiliates from their
association with the Fund. The Independent Directors concluded that potential
"fall-out" benefits that they may receive, such as greater name recognition or
increased ability to obtain research or brokerage services, appear to be
reasonable, and may in some cases benefit the Fund.

Conclusions

   In considering the Agreements, the Independent Directors did not identify
any factor as all-important or all-controlling and instead considered these
factors collectively in light of the Fund's surrounding circumstances. Based on
this review, it was the judgment of the Independent Directors that shareholders
had received acceptable absolute and relative performance at reasonable fees
and, therefore, re-approval of the Investment Advisory Agreements with the
Adviser and the Servicing Agreement with the Sub-Adviser were in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a part of their decision-making
process, the Independent Directors noted their belief that a long-term
relationship with capable, conscientious advisers is in the best interests of
the Fund. The Independent Directors considered, generally, that shareholders
invested in a Fund knowing that the Adviser managed that Fund and knowing its
investment management fee schedule. As such, the Independent Directors
considered, in particular, whether the Adviser, with the assistance of the
Sub-Adviser, managed the Fund in accordance with its investment objectives and
policies as disclosed to shareholders, and concluded that the Fund was so
managed.

   Upon conclusion of their review and discussion, the Independent Directors,
voting separately, and the full Board unanimously approved the continuation of
the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Service Agreement.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.
