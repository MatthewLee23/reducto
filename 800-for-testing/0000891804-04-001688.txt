PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


July 21, 2004

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to let you know that FleetBoston Financial Corporation and Bank
of America Corporation have merged, effective April 1, 2004. As a result of the
merger, Columbia Management Group and your Colonial High Income Municipal Trust
became part of the Bank of America family of companies. Looking ahead, we
believe this merger will be a real benefit to our shareholders. Preserving and
leveraging our strengths, the combined organization intends to deliver
additional research and management capabilities, as well as new products. There
are no immediate changes planned for fund names, product lines, or customer
service contacts.

As you might know, on March 15, 2004, FleetBoston Financial announced an
agreement in principle with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") and the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") to settle charges involving
market timing in Columbia Management mutual funds. (You may also know that Bank
of America came to a similar settlement in principle at the same time.) The
agreement requires the final approval of the SEC and the NYAG. This settlement
in principle reflects our strong wish to put this regrettable situation behind
us. Columbia Management has taken and will continue to take steps to strengthen
policies, procedures and oversight to curb frequent trading of Columbia open-end
fund shares.

Both your fund's trustees and Columbia Management are committed to serving the
interests of our shareholders, and we will continue to work hard to help you
achieve your financial goals.

As always, thank you for choosing Colonial High Income Municipal Trust, and for
giving us the opportunity to help you build a strong financial future.

Sincerely,


/s/ Thomas C. Theobald              /s/ J. Kevin Connaughton

Thomas C. Theobald                      J. Kevin Connaughton
Chairman, Board of Trustees             President

J. Kevin Connaughton was named president of Colonial High Income Municipal Trust
on February 27, 2004.

Economic and market conditions change frequently. There is no assurance that
the trends described in this report will continue or commence.

Sector breakdown is calculated as a percentage of net assets (including auction
preferred shares). Quality breakdown is calculated as a percentage of total
investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the highest rating
assigned to a particular bond by one of the following nationally-recognized
rating agencies: Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
or Fitch Ratings Ltd.

Because the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
continue to invest in these sectors or maintain this quality breakdown in the
future.





For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust returned negative 1.07%, based on investment at net asset value. The trust
trailed its peer group, the Lipper High Yield Municipal Debt Funds Category,
which averaged a return of 0.74%.1

The trust's investments in multi-family housing and airline bonds detracted from
performance. Multi-family housing bonds declined as low interest rates allowed
more renters to become homeowners, resulting in high apartment vacancy rates.
Delta Air Lines and US Airways (0.1% and 0.2% of total investments,
respectively)2 turned in disappointing returns. The trust's above-average stake
in nursing home bonds further hampered returns.

The trust's slightly short duration hindered performance early on when stagnant
job growth drove interest rates lower. Duration is a measure, expressed in
years, of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. As interest rates
fell, bonds with shorter durations did not appreciate as much as bonds with
longer durations. We made up some, but not all, of this relative
underperformance in the spring when job growth picked up and interest rates
moved higher.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, the trust had an even lower return
of negative 6.79%, based on its market price, as the discount to net asset value
increased. Fears that higher short-term interest rates would hurt the trust's
dividend yield put pressure on the trust's stock price.

LEVERAGE HELPED BOOST INCOME

During the period the trust derived added income from its leverage. These are
preferred shares, issued in 1999, which allowed the trust to borrow against its
underlying investments. We invested the proceeds from these shares in longer
maturity, higher-yielding bonds, while paying out a short-term rate that is
influenced by the federal funds rate. The trust earns the difference between the
rate paid to the preferred shareholders and the yield on the longer maturity
securities. With the federal funds rate at 1.0% during this reporting period,
the difference was significant and resulted in added income for the trust.
However, going forward, if the trend is toward higher interest rates, the rate
paid on the preferred shares could rise, lowering the income available for
paying dividends on the common shares.

1    Lipper Inc., a widely respected data provider in the industry, calculates
     an average total return for mutual funds with similar investment objectives
     as those of the trust.

2    Holdings are disclosed as of May 31, 2004, and are subject to change.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

To bolster the trust's yield, we sold some higher quality bonds and replaced
them with higher-yielding issues. We also replaced 30-year bonds with 20-year
bonds with nearly comparable yields but shorter durations, which should make
them less volatile as interest rates rise. These shorter-maturity bonds did
well.

The trust further benefited from its above-average stake in health care bonds,
which were strong performers. Specific issues, such as HealthEast, a Minnesota
hospital, and Eskaton Gold River Lodge, an elder care facility in northern
California (0.7% and 0.4% of total investments, respectively)2 rallied amid
credit improvements. In addition, we took advantage of attractive yields in the
retirement housing sector, buying bonds issued by well-run companies that were
expanding their facilities. We also purchased securities issued by Charter Mac,
a multi-family housing loan pool (1.0% of total investments).2

LOOKING AHEAD TO RISING INTEREST RATES

We plan to maintain the trust's slightly short duration on the expectation that
interest rates will rise gradually as job gains fuel the economy, while high oil
prices keep growth somewhat in check. In this environment, we continue to
believe that high-yield bonds will outpace higher quality issues.

municipal funds for Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. or its predecessors since
May 1996.



Past performance is no guarantee of future investment results. Current
performance may be higher or lower than the performance data shown.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in
high-yield securities offers the potential for high current income and
attractive total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks
include default of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax
for individuals and corporations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

May 31, 2004 (Unaudited)


NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial High Income Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL
The Trust seeks to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes. The Trust's secondary goal is to seek total return.

TRUST SHARES
The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 4,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION
Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The services may use
various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations
are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid
quotation. Certain debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of
lesser quality, are priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial
condition of the issuer and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations
developed through pricing techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized
upon sale of the securities, and the potential variation may be greater for
those securities valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or quotations
which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures established by
and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS
The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
may invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded on the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin payable or receivable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

OPTIONS
The Trust may write call and put options on futures it owns or in which it may
invest. Writing put options tends to increase the Trust's exposure to the
underlying instrument. Writing call options tends to decrease the


17
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2004 (Unaudited)


Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. When the Trust writes a call or
put option, an amount equal to the premium received is recorded as a liability
and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as
realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or
closed are added to the proceeds or offset against the amounts paid on the
underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. The Trust
as a writer of an option has no control over whether the underlying future may
be sold (call) or purchased (put) and as a result bears the market risk of an
unfavorable change in the price of the future underlying the written option.
There is the risk the Trust may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid market.

The Trust may also purchase put and call options. Purchasing call options tends
to increase the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. Purchasing put
options tends to decrease the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. The
Trust pays a premium, which is included in the Trust's Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
current value of the option. The risk associated with purchasing put and call
options is limited to the premium paid. Premiums paid for purchasing options
which expire are treated as realized losses. Premiums paid for purchasing
options which are exercised or closed are added to the amounts paid or offset
against the proceeds on the underlying future transaction to determine the
realized gain or loss. The Trust's custodian will set aside cash or liquid
portfolio securities equal to the amount of the written options contract
commitment in a separate account.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES
Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from registration. In
some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust or
in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many
restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES
The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Trust
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies cash or
liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an amount equal
to the delayed delivery commitment.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions
and dividend income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS
The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will distribute
substantially all of its taxable or tax-exempt income, if any, for its tax year,
and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust
intends to distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net
investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that
the Trust should not be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore no federal
income or excise tax provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on ex-date. Distributions to
Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of each
dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven
days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2004 was 1.05% for
Series T and 1.06% for Series W. For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the
Trust declared dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to
$590,277, representing an average APS dividend rate of 0.98%.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION
The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended November 30, 2003
was as follows:
Distributions paid from:
   Tax-Exempt Income                            $16,377,912
   Ordinary Income*                                  23,800
   Long-Term Capital Gains                               --

     *  For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are
        considered ordinary income distributions.

Unrealized appreciation and depreciation at May 31, 2004, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes was:

   Unrealized appreciation                     $ 14,212,099
   Unrealized depreciation                      (20,770,632)
                                               ------------

Capital loss carryforwards of $5,267,623 were utilized and/or expired during the
year ended November 30, 2003 for the Trust.

Expired capital loss carryforwards are recorded as a reduction of paid-in
capital.

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES
Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia") is the investment advisor to the
Trust. Prior to April 1, 2004, Columbia was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Trust's investment advisor, was acquired by Bank of
America Corporation ("BOA"). The acquisition did not change the way the Trust is
managed, the investment personnel assigned to manage the Trust or the fees paid
by the Trust.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE
Columbia provides administrative and other services to the Trust in addition to
investment advisory services. Columbia receives a monthly investment advisory
fee at the annual rate of 0.75% of the Trust's average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, Columbia pays the total fees received
to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to APS,
exceed $50 million, an additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is
calculated by taking into account the fees payable to State Street under the
Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to the average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to APS, of the Trust for that month. The Trust also
pays additional fees for pricing services based on the number of securities held
by the Trust. For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the Trust's annualized
effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.050%.

CUSTODY CREDITS
The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Trust could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an
income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES
The Trust pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of
the Trust's assets.

OTHER
Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the Trust paid $802 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the six months ended May 31, 2004, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $20,915,235 and
$21,905,126, respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 4,800 APS (2,400 shares each of Series T and
Series W). The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust on any dividend
payment date at the redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus an amount equal
to any dividends accumulated on a daily basis unpaid through the redemption date
(whether or not such dividends have been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to

19
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2004 (Unaudited)


meet more stringent asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS
Agreement and in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating
agencies. Should these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on
the APS not be paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare
dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At
May 31, 2004, there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS
AND CONTINGENCIES

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at May 31, 2004 invested
in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois and Texas and their respective political subdivisions, agencies and
public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to economic and political
factors adversely affecting issuers of the specific state's municipal securities
than are municipal bond funds that are not concentrated to the same extent in
these issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES
Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. Government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk bonds." Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to
repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would likely
have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover, high-yield
securities may be less liquid to the extent there is no established secondary
market.

INDUSTRY FOCUS
The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Columbia and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. ("CFDI"), and certain of their
affiliates (collectively, "the Columbia Group") have received information
requests and subpoenas from various regulatory and law enforcement authorities
in connection with their investigations of late trading and market timing in
mutual funds, as well as other industry wide issues. The Columbia Group has not
uncovered any instances where Columbia or CFDI were knowingly involved in late
trading of mutual fund shares.

On February 24, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a
civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against Columbia and CFDI, alleging that they had violated certain
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with trading activity in
mutual fund shares. Also on February 24, 2004, the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") filed a civil complaint in New York Supreme Court, County of New York
against Columbia and CFDI alleging that Columbia and CFDI had violated certain
New York anti-fraud statutes. If either Columbia or CFDI is unsuccessful in its
defense of these proceedings, it could be barred from serving as an investment
advisor or distributor for any investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (a "registered investment company").
Such results could prevent Columbia, CFDI or any company that is an affiliated
person of Columbia and CFDI from serving as an investment advisor or distributor
for any registered investment company, including your fund. Your fund has been
informed by Columbia and CFDI that, if these results occur, they will seek
exemptive relief from the SEC to permit them to continue to serve as your fund's
investment advisor and distributor. There is no assurance that such exemptive
relief will be granted. On March 15, 2004, Columbia and CFDI entered into
agreements in principle with the SEC Division of Enforcement and NYAG in
settlement of the charges. Under the agreements, Columbia and CFDI agreed, among
other things, to the following conditions: payment of $70 million in
disgorgement; payment of $70 million in civil penalties; an order requiring
Columbia and CFDI to cease and desist from violations of the antifraud
provisions and other provisions of the federal securities laws; governance
changes designed to maintain the independence of the mutual fund boards of
trustees and ensure compliance with securities laws and their fiduciary duties;
and retention of an independent consultant to review Columbia's and CFDI's
compliance policies and procedures. The agreement requires the final approval of
the SEC. In a separate agreement with the NYAG, the Columbia Group has agreed to
reduce mutual fund fees by $80 million over a five-year period.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, there may be increased redemptions or reduced sales of fund
shares, which could increase transaction costs or operating expenses, or have
other adverse consequences for the funds.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain trusts, their Boards and/or FleetBoston (and
affiliated entities). These suits and certain regulatory investigations are
ongoing. Accordingly, an estimate of the financial impact of this litigation on
any trust, if any, cannot currently be made.

(a)The Trust changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to November 30.
(b)Per share data was calculated using average shares outstanding during the
   period.
(c)Effective December 1, 2001, the Trust adopted the provisions of the AICPA
   Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
   market discount on all debt securities. The effect of this change, for the
   year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets from 8.31% to 8.36% and increase the ratio of
   net investment income (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders) from 7.48% to 7.53%. The impact to net investment income and
   net realized and unrealized loss per share was less than $0.01. Per share
   data and ratios for periods prior to November 30, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.
(d)The per share net investment income amount does not reflect the period's
   reclassification of differences between book and tax basis net investment
   income.
(e)Total return at market value assuming all distributions reinvested at prices
   calculated in accordance with the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
(f)Not annualized.
(g)The benefits derived from custody credits and directed brokerage
   arrangements, if applicable, had an impact of less than 0.01%.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

COLONIAL HIGH INCOME MUNICIPAL TRUST

Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Agent"), as
agent under the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the
Plan, the provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making such
an election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed directly
to the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the Trust.
If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend or
distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will be
issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value of 95% of the market
price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares at such
time, or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable only in
cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust shares in
the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average
per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value
of the Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust. In
circumstances in which the net asset value of Trust shares is more than 5% below
their market price, participants in the Plan will be issued shares through the
Plan at a price exceeding net asset value.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to the
participant's account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be
made for any fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's
notice of election to participate in or withdraw from the Plan must be received
by the Plan Agent before the record date for a dividend in order to be given
effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, or by phone at
1-800-730-6001.

     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          evaluation; and

     (c)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
