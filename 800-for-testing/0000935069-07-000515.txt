THE GABELLI
EQUITY TRUST INC.


                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2006






TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2006.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the "Fund") is a non-diversified
closed-end  management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation on
May 20, 1986 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "1940  Act"),  whose  primary  objective  is  long-term  growth of capital.
Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

     The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in equity  securities under
normal  market  conditions  (the "80%  Policy").  The 80%  Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval.  The Fund will provide shareholders with notice at
least 60 days prior to the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") so  determines,  by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign  market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities  will be fair valued as  determined  by the Board.  Debt  instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board.  Fair  valuation  methodologies  and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial  information  about the company;  comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign  securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     In September  2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  157, Fair Value
Measurements,  which  clarifies  the  definition  of  fair  value  and  requires
companies  to expand  their  disclosure  about the use of fair  value to measure
assets and  liabilities  in interim  and annual  periods  subsequent  to initial
recognition.  Adoption of SFAS 157  requires  the use of the price that would be
received  to sell  an  asset  or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an  orderly
transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date. SFAS 157 is
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
November 15, 2007, and interim  periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is in the process of reviewing the  requirements  of SFAS 157 against
its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At December
31, 2006, the Fund had investments of $219,449,000 in repurchase agreements.

     INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT  COMPANIES.  The Fund may invest, from time
to time,  in shares of other  investment  companies  (or entities  that would be
considered investment companies but are excluded from the definition pursuant to
certain exceptions under the 1940 Act) (the "Acquired Funds") in accordance with
the 1940 Act and related rules.

     As a  shareholder  in the Fund,  you would bear the pro rata portion of the
periodic expenses of the Acquired Funds in addition to the Fund's expenses.

     For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund's pro rata portion of
the  periodic  expenses  charged by the  Acquired  Funds was less than one basis
point.

     OPTIONS.  The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on  securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Fund  receives  a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial  instrument  underlying

                                       13
<PAGE>

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the price of the underlying financial
instrument  decreases  between  the date the option is  written  and the date on
which the option is terminated.  The Fund would realize a gain, to the extent of
the premium,  if the price of the financial  instrument  increases between those
dates.

     As a  purchaser  of put  options,  the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines,  the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise.  If the
price of the  underlying  security  increases or stays the same,  the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at  expiration  date,  but only to the extent of the
premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money",  "at-the-money", and "out-of-the-money",  respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) covered  at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects
that the  price  of the  underlying  security  will  remain  stable  or  advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money  call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the  appreciation in the price of the underlying  security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the  underlying  security  above
the  exercise  price  of  the  option.   Out-of-the-money,   at-the-money,   and
in-the-money  put options  (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of  the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the  "counterparty")
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the Fund's  variable rate payment  obligation on Series C Preferred
Stock. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty
and, to the extent that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a predetermined
fixed rate,  would  receive from that  counterparty  payments of the  difference
based  on  the  notional  amount  of  such  cap.  Interest  rate  swap  and  cap
transactions  introduce  additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay  preferred  stock  dividends  when due in  accordance  with the  Articles
Supplementary even if the counterparty  defaulted.  If there is a default by the
counterparty  to a swap  contract,  the  Fund  will be  limited  to  contractual
remedies  pursuant to the  agreements  related to the  transaction.  There is no
assurance  that  the swap  contract  counterparties  will be able to meet  their
obligations  pursuant to a swap contract or that,  in the event of default,  the
Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from  obtaining  payments owed to it
pursuant  to  a  swap  contract.  The  creditworthiness  of  the  swap  contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio  securities  at that point in time,  such a default  could  negatively
affect  the Fund's  ability to make  dividend  payments  for Series C  Preferred
Stock. In addition, at the time an interest rate swap or cap transaction reaches
its scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Fund will not be able
to obtain a replacement  transaction or that the terms of the  replacement  will
not be as  favorable as on the expiring  transaction.  If this occurs,  it could
have a negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments on Series
C Preferred Stock.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with  Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement, the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

   NOTIONAL                      FLOATING RATE*      TERMINATION     UNREALIZED

- --------------
* Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against  changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and in the
value of  securities  it  intends  to  purchase.  Upon  entering  into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation)  on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market.  Open futures contracts at December 31,
2006 are reflected within the Schedule of Investments.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in unrealized  appreciation/(depreciation)  on investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At December  31,  2006,  there were no open  forward
foreign exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books  and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/(depreciation)  on investments and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase  securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments,  or currency  repatriation,  a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED  AND ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The Fund may invest up to 10% of its
net assets in securities for which the markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities
include  securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial  legal or
contractual  restrictions.  The sale of illiquid  securities often requires more
time and  results  in higher  brokerage  charges or dealer  discounts  and other
selling  expenses  than does the sale of  securities  eligible  for  trading  on
national securities  exchanges or in the  over-the-counter  markets.  Restricted
securities  may  sell at a price  lower  than  similar  securities  that are not
subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities  freely saleable among qualified
institutional investors under special rules adopted by the SEC may be treated as
liquid  if they  satisfy  liquidity  standards  established  by the  Board.  The
continued  liquidity  of  such  securities  is not as  well  assured  as that of
publicly  traded  securities,  and  accordingly  the Board  will  monitor  their
liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN  FEE  CREDITS  AND  INTEREST  EXPENSE.  When  cash  balances  are
maintained in the custody  account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits". When cash balances are
overdrawn,  the Fund is  charged  an  overdraft  fee equal to 110% of the 90 day
Treasury Bill rate on outstanding balances.  This amount, if any, would be shown
as "interest expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with Federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications  have no impact on NAV of the Fund.  For the fiscal year ended
December  31,  2006,  reclassifications  were made to increase  accumulated  net
investment income by $1,732 and increase accumulated  distributions in excess of
net realized gain on investments,  options,  futures contracts,  swap contracts,
and foreign currency  transactions by $51,952,  with an offsetting adjustment to
paid-in capital.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  7.20%  Series B  Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, 5.875% Series
D Cumulative  Preferred Stock, Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock,
and 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are
recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described in Note 5.

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     As of December 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

                  Net unrealized appreciation on investments       $475,036,839

     In July  2006,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting  for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an  Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("the
Interpretation").  The  Interpretation  establishes for all entities,  including
pass  through  entities  such as the Fund,  a minimum  threshold  for  financial
statement  recognition  of the benefit of positions  taken in filing tax returns
(including  whether  an entity is  taxable in a  particular  jurisdiction),  and
requires certain expanded tax disclosures.  The Interpretation is required to be
implemented  for the Fund no later than June 29,  2007,  and is to be applied to
all open tax  years as of the date of  effectiveness.  Management  has  begun to
evaluate the  application  of the  Interpretation  to the Fund,  and is not in a
position at this time to estimate the significance of its impact, if any, on the
Fund's financial statements.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's  average
weekly net  assets  including  the  liquidation  value of  preferred  stock.  In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the  management fee on the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

     The Fund's total  return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred Stock for the period.  For the fiscal year ended
December  31,  2006,  the Fund's  total  return on the NAV of the common  shares
exceeded the stated dividend rate or corresponding  swap rate of all outstanding
Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

     During the fiscal year ended  December  31, 2006,  the Fund paid  brokerage
commissions  of $483,095 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli & Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory  Agreement  between the Fund and the Adviser.  During the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund paid or accrued $45,000 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     The Fund is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the  Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the amount of $30,061  for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2006,  which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement
of Operations.

     The Fund pays each  Director  that is not  considered  to be an  affiliated
person an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended
and they are  reimbursed  for any out of pocket  expenses  incurred in attending
meetings.  All Board committee members receive $1,000 per meeting  attended.  In
addition,  the Audit Committee  Chairman  receives an annual fee of $3,000,  the
Proxy  Voting  Committee  Chairman  receives  an annual fee of  $1,500,  and the
Nominating  Committee  Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000.  Directors who
are  directors or employees of the Adviser or an affiliated  company  receive no
compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

the year ended December 31, 2006, other than short-term  securities,  aggregated

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Fund to issue 246,000,000  shares of common
stock (par value  $0.001) and  authorizes  the Board to increase its  authorized
shares from time to time.  The Board has authorized the repurchase of its shares
on the open market  when the shares are  trading on the New York Stock  Exchange
("NYSE") at a discount of 10% or more (or such other percentage as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the NAV of the shares.  During the fiscal year
ended  December 31, 2006,  the Fund did not  repurchase any shares of its common
stock in the open market.

     The Fund's Articles of Incorporation,  as amended,  authorizes the issuance
of up to 18,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the  common  stock and  results in the
financial  leveraging of the common stock. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Articles  Supplementary  to meet certain  asset  coverage  tests with
respect  to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Fund  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not  correct  such  failure,  the Fund may be required to
redeem,  in part or in full,  the 7.20% Series B, Series C Auction Rate,  5.875%
Series D, Series E Auction Rate, and 6.20% Series F Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
at redemption prices of $25, $25,000, $25, $25,000, and $25,  respectively,  per
share plus an amount equal to the  accumulated and unpaid  dividends  whether or
not declared on such shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,
failure to meet the foregoing  asset  coverage  requirements  could restrict the
Fund's ability to pay dividends to common  shareholders  and could lead to sales
of portfolio  securities at inopportune times. The income received on the Fund's
assets may vary in a manner  unrelated  to the fixed and variable  rates,  which
could have either a beneficial or detrimental  impact on net  investment  income
and gains available to common shareholders.

     On September 21, 2005, the Fund distributed one transferable right for each
of the 143,681,301  shares of common stock outstanding to shareholders of record
on that date. Seven rights were required to purchase one additional common share
at the subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders who exercised their
full  primary   subscription  rights  were  eligible  for  an  over-subscription
privilege  entitling  them to subscribe,  subject to certain  limitations  and a
pro-rata  allotment,  for any  additional  shares not purchased  pursuant to the
primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized by the Board in
accordance with the registration  statement.  The subscription period expired on
October 26, 2005.  The rights  offering was fully  subscribed,  having  received
over-subscription  requests  in  excess  of the  shares  available  for  primary
subscription  resulting in the issuance of 20,525,901 shares of common stock and
proceeds  of  $143,681,307  to the Fund,  prior to the  deduction  of  estimated
expenses of $600,000.  Additional expenses of $151,821 were recorded in the year
ended  December 31,  2006.  The NAV of the Fund's  common  shares was reduced by
approximately $0.15 per share as a result of the issuance of shares below NAV.

     On June 20, 2001,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $159,329,175  (after
underwriting discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325) from the
public  offering of  6,600,000  shares of 7.20%  Series B  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Commencing  June 20, 2006 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option,  may
redeem the 7.20% Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time. On June 26, 2006,  the Fund, as authorized by the
Board,  redeemed  25%  (1,650,000  shares)  of its  outstanding  7.20%  Series B
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock at the  redemption  price of $25.00  per share (the
liquidation  value).  The Series B Preferred Shares were callable at any time at
the  liquidation  value plus accrued  dividends  following the expiration of the
five year call  protection  on June 20, 2006.  At December  31, 2006,  4,950,000
shares of 7.20% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued
dividends amounted to $148,500.

     On June 27, 2002,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $128,246,557  (after
underwriting discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443) from the
public  offering of 5,200 shares of Series C Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every  seven  days,  is expected to vary with  short-term  interest  rates.  The
dividend rates of Series C Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from
4.21% to 5.27% for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Existing  shareholders may
submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each auction date. Series C
Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock  shareholders  may also trade shares in
the secondary market.  The Fund, at its option,  may redeem the Series C Auction
Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at
any time.  During the fiscal  year ended  December  31,  2006,  the Fund did not
redeem  any  shares of Series C Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At
December 31, 2006,  5,200 shares of Series C Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock were  outstanding  with an  annualized  dividend rate of 5.26% and accrued
dividends amounted to $95,241.

     The holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class.  The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain  circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Directors.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts  and  expects  the risk of loss to be remote.

7. REORGANIZATION. On September 13, 2005, the Fund acquired substantially all of
the  net  assets  of  the  Sterling   Capital  Corp.   pursuant  to  a  Plan  of
Reorganization  approved by Sterling  Capital Corp.  on September 12, 2005.  The
acquisition was  accomplished by a tax free exchange of 1,978,190  common shares
of the Fund valued at  $18,306,860  for the net assets of the  Sterling  Capital
Corp. on September 12, 2005. Sterling Capital Corp.'s net assets of $18,306,860,
including $2,191,264 of unrealized appreciation, were combined with those of the
Fund on September 13, 2005. The net assets  attributable to common shares of the
Fund immediately before the acquisition were $1,273,163,812.

8. SUBSEQUENT  EVENTS. On January 8, 2007, the Fund, as authorized by the Board,
redeemed 100% (4,950,000  shares) of its  outstanding  7.20% Series B Cumulative
Preferred  Stock at the  redemption  price of $25.00 per share (the  liquidation
value),  plus  accumulated and unpaid  dividends  through the redemption date of
$0.06  per  share.  The  Preferred  Shares  were  callable  at any  time  at the
liquidation  value plus accrued  dividends  following the expiration of the five
year call protection on June 20, 2006.

9. OTHER MATTERS.  The Adviser  and/or  affiliates  received  subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund share  trading  practices  involving  certain  funds  managed by the
Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,   Inc.  ("GAMCO"),  the  Adviser's  parent  company,
responded to these  requests for documents and  testimony.  In June 2006,  GAMCO
began discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry.
In February  2007,  the Adviser made an offer of  settlement to the staff of the
SEC for  communication  to the Commission for its  consideration to resolve this
matter.  This offer of settlement is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents.  On a
separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the
SEC that the staff may recommend to the Commission that an administrative remedy
and a monetary penalty be sought from the Adviser in connection with the actions
of two of seven  closed-end  funds  managed by the  Adviser  relating to Section
19(a)  and Rule  19a-1 of the 1940  Act.  These  provisions  require  registered
investment  companies  to provide  written  statements  to  shareholders  when a
dividend is made from a source other than net investment  income.  While the two
closed-end funds sent annual statements and provided other materials  containing
this information, the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with
each  distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser  believes that all of the funds
are now in  compliance.  The Adviser  believes  that these matters would have no
effect on the Fund or any material  adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability
to manage the Fund.  The  staff's  notice to the  Adviser  did not relate to the
Fund.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of The Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.
(hereafter  referred to as the "Fund") at December 31, 2006,  the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial  highlights for each of
the periods  presented,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and
financial highlights  (hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2006 by  correspondence  with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SERIES C AND E AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

    Auction Rate  Preferred  Shares pay dividends  weekly based on a rate set at
auction,  usually held every seven days.  The  percentage of 2006  distributions
derived from long-term  capital gains for the Series C and Series E Auction Rate
Preferred Shares was 74.89%.

    A Form  1099-DIV  has been mailed to all  shareholders  of record which sets
forth specific  amounts to be included in the 2006 tax returns.  Ordinary income
distributions  include net investment income and realized net short-term capital
gains.  Ordinary  income is reported in box 1a of Form  1099-DIV.  Capital  gain
distributions  are  reported  in box 2a of Form  1099-DIV.  The  long-term  gain
distributions for the fiscal  year ended December 31, 2006 were $128,475,966, or
the maximum allowable.

CORPORATE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION, QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

    In 2006, the Fund paid to common, 7.20% Series B, 5.875% Series D, and 6.20%
Series F preferred  shareholders  ordinary income totaling  $0.22090,  $0.45100,
$0.36881,   and  $0.05007  per  share,   respectively.   The  Fund  paid  weekly
distributions  to Series C and Series E preferred  shareholders at varying rates
throughout the year,  including an ordinary income dividend totaling  $309.66231
and  $307.25932  per share,  respectively,  in 2006.  For the fiscal  year ended
December  31, 2006,  100% of the  ordinary  income  dividend  qualified  for the
dividend  received  deduction  available  to  corporations,  and  92.41%  of the
ordinary  income  distribution  was  deemed  qualified  dividend  income  and is
reported in box 1b on Form  1099-DIV.  The  percentage  of the  ordinary  income
dividends paid by the Fund during 2006 derived from U.S.  Government  Securities
was  0.51%.  Such  income is  exempt  from  state  and local tax in all  states.
However, many states,  including New York and California,  allow a tax exemption
for a portion of the income  earned only if a mutual fund has  invested at least
50% of its assets at the end of each  quarter of the Fund's  fiscal year in U.S.
Government  Securities.  The Fund did not meet this strict  requirement in 2006.
The percentage of U.S.  Government  Securities  held as of December 31, 2006 was
1.29%.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN
ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN
   It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust  Inc.  (the  "Fund")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to issue shares of common  stock to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of the Fund.  Plan  participants  may
send  their  stock   certificates   to   Computershare   Trust   Company,   N.A.
("Computershare") to be held in their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered
shareholders  wishing to receive  their  distribution  in cash must  submit this
request in writing to:
                          The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

   Shareholders  requesting  this cash election  must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

   If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank, or nominee, you should
contact such institution.  If such institution is not participating in the Plan,
your account will be credited with a cash  dividend.  In order to participate in
the Plan through  such  institution,  it may be  necessary  for you to have your
shares  taken out of  "street  name" and  re-registered  in your own name.  Once
registered in your own name your  dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested.
Certain brokers participate in the Plan.  Shareholders holding shares in "street
name"  at   participating   institutions   will  have  dividends   automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

   The number of shares of common stock  distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the Plan,
whenever the market price of the Fund's  common stock is equal to or exceeds net
asset value at the time shares are valued for purposes of determining the number
of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends  or  capital  gains  distribution,
participants  are issued shares of common stock valued at the greater of (i) the
net asset  value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of the then  current
market price of the Fund's common stock.  The valuation  date is the dividend or
distribution  payment  date or,  if that date is not a New York  Stock  Exchange
("NYSE") trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of the common
stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market  price of the common  stock,
participants  will receive  shares from the Fund valued at market price.  If the
Fund should  declare a dividend or capital  gains  distribution  payable only in
cash,  Computershare will buy common stock in the open market, or on the NYSE or
elsewhere,  for the  participants'  accounts,  except  that  Computershare  will
endeavor to  terminate  purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue
shares at net asset value if, following the commencement of such purchases,  the
market value of the common stock exceeds the then current net asset value.

   The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will
not  relieve  participants  of any  income  tax  which  may be  payable  on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another vehicle for our  shareholders
to  increase  their  investment  in the  Fund.  In order to  participate  in the
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  shareholders must have their shares registered in
their own name.

   Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's shares
at the then current market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from $250 to
$10,000.  Computershare  will use  these  funds to  purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will  charge
each shareholder who participates  $0.75, plus a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary cash payments be sent to Computershare, P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010 such that Computershare  receives such payments approximately 10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment  until the next purchase
date.  A payment  may be  withdrawn  without  charge if  notice is  received  by
Computershare at least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

   SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so in
writing or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

   For more information  regarding the Dividend  Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Fund.

   The Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
written  notice of the change  sent to the  members of the Plan at least 90 days
before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The Plan also may be
amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days' written  notice to
participants in the Plan.

         of the registrant is responsible  for  pre-approving  (i) all audit and
         permissible  non-audit  services  to be  provided  by  the  independent
         registered  public  accounting  firm to the  registrant  and  (ii)  all

         registered public  accounting firm to the Adviser,  Gabelli Funds, LLC,
         and any  affiliate of Gabelli  Funds,  LLC  ("Gabelli")  that  provides
         services to the  registrant  (a  "Covered  Services  Provider")  if the
         independent  registered public  accounting  firm's  engagement  related
         directly to the operations and financial  reporting of the  registrant.
         The Committee may delegate its  responsibility  to pre-approve any such
         audit and  permissible  non-audit  services to the  Chairperson  of the
         Committee,  and the  Chairperson  must report to the Committee,  at its
         next regularly  scheduled meeting after the Chairperson's  pre-approval
         of such  services,  his or her  decision(s).  The  Committee  may  also
         establish   detailed   pre-approval   policies   and   procedures   for
         pre-approval  of such  services in  accordance  with  applicable  laws,
         including the delegation of some or all of the Committee's pre-approval
         responsibilities  to the  other  persons  (other  than  Gabelli  or the
         registrant's   officers).   Pre-approval   by  the   Committee  of  any
         permissible  non-audit  services  is not  required  so long as: (i) the
         permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the registrant at
         the time of the  engagement  to be  non-audit  services;  and (ii) such
         services are promptly  brought to the  attention of the  Committee  and
         approved by the Committee or Chairperson prior to the completion of the
         audit.


  (e)(2) The percentage of services  described in each of paragraphs (b) through

                           (b)  100%

                           (c)  100%

                           (d)  100%
<PAGE>

     (f)  The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal  accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were  attributed to work  performed by persons
          other than the principal accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
          was 0%.

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services  rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant  for  each  of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the
         registrant was $0 for 2005 and $0 for 2006.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately  designated  audit  committee  consisting of the
following  members:  Anthony J.  Colavita,  Anthony R Pustorino and Salvatore J.
Zizza.


ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.



ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset  Management Inc.,  Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities,  Inc., and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. (collectively,
the  "Advisers")  to  determine  how  to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict  between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the  Advisers;  the  principal  underwriter;  or any  affiliated  person  of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the  Advisers do not have  voting  discretion  or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific  guidelines  or  procedures  supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).
<PAGE>

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

The Proxy Voting  Committee was originally  formed in April 1989 for the purpose
of formulating  guidelines and reviewing proxy statements  within the parameters
set by the substantive  proxy voting  guidelines  originally  published by GAMCO
Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are appended
as  Exhibit  A.  The  Committee  will  include   representatives   of  Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee.

         Meetings  are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in which
the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         A.    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

               THE ADVISERS HAVE  IMPLEMENTED  THESE PROXY VOTING  PROCEDURES IN
               ORDER TO PREVENT  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  FROM  INFLUENCING  THEIR
               PROXY VOTING  DECISIONS.  BY FOLLOWING THE PROXY  GUIDELINES,  AS
               WELL AS THE  RECOMMENDATIONS  OF ISS, OTHER THIRD-PARTY  SERVICES
               AND THE  ANALYSTS OF GABELLI & COMPANY,  THE ADVISERS ARE ABLE TO
               AVOID, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE INFLUENCE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF
               INTEREST.  NEVERTHELESS,  CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE IN WHICH ONE OR
               MORE OF THE ADVISERS ARE FACED WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR THE
               APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH ITS VOTE.
               IN  GENERAL,  A CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST  MAY ARISE WHEN AN ADVISER
               KNOWINGLY DOES BUSINESS WITH AN ISSUER,  AND MAY APPEAR TO HAVE A
               MATERIAL  CONFLICT BETWEEN ITS OWN INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF
               THE  SHAREHOLDERS OF AN INVESTMENT  COMPANY MANAGED BY ONE OF THE
               ADVISERS  REGARDING HOW THE PROXY IS TO BE VOTED. A CONFLICT ALSO
               MAY EXIST WHEN AN  ADVISER  HAS  ACTUAL  KNOWLEDGE  OF A MATERIAL
               BUSINESS  ARRANGEMENT  BETWEEN AN ISSUER AND AN  AFFILIATE OF THE
               ADVISER.
<PAGE>

               IN  PRACTICAL  TERMS,  A CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST  MAY  ARISE,  FOR
               EXAMPLE,  WHEN A PROXY IS VOTED FOR A COMPANY THAT IS A CLIENT OF
               ONE OF THE  ADVISERS,  SUCH AS  GAMCO  ASSET  MANAGEMENT  INC.  A
               CONFLICT  ALSO MAY ARISE WHEN A CLIENT OF ONE OF THE ADVISERS HAS
               MADE A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL IN A PROXY TO BE VOTED UPON BY ONE OR
               MORE OF THE  ADVISERS.  THE  DIRECTOR OF PROXY  VOTING  SERVICES,
               TOGETHER WITH THE LEGAL  DEPARTMENT,  WILL SCRUTINIZE ALL PROXIES
               FOR THESE OR OTHER SITUATIONS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO A CONFLICT OF
               INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO THE VOTING OF PROXIES.

         A.    OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE.

               For  matters  submitted  to the  Committee,  each  member  of the
               Committee will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the proxy
               statement,  any relevant third party  research,  a summary of any
               views   provided  by  the  Chief   Investment   Officer  and  any
               recommendations by Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  analysts.  The Chief
               Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may be
               invited to present  their  viewpoints.  IF THE  DIRECTOR OF PROXY
               VOTING SERVICES or the Legal  Department  believe that the matter
               before the  committee  is one with respect to which a conflict of
               interest  may exist  between  the  Advisers  and  their  clients,
               counsel will provide an opinion to the Committee  concerning  the
               conflict.  If the  matter  is one in which the  interests  of the
               clients of one or more of Advisers may  diverge,  counsel will so
               advise and the Committee may make different recommendations as to
               different  clients.  For any matters where the recommendation may
               trigger  appraisal  rights,   counsel  will  provide  an  opinion
               concerning  the  likely  risks and  merits  of such an  appraisal
               action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.
<PAGE>

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers' staff may request proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

         If a client  wishes to receive a proxy  voting  record on a  quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1.  Custodian  banks,  outside  brokerage  firms and Wexford  Clearing  Services
Corporation are responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.
<PAGE>

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

 3. In the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions  from the proxy committee (see  Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue
         The rationale for the vote when it appropriate

Records  prior to the  institution  of the PROXY EDGE system  include:
         Security name
         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Date of Meeting
         Name of Custodian
         Name of Client
         Custodian Account Number
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' recommendation
         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue
         Date the proxy statement was received and by whom
         Name of person posting the vote
         Date and method by which the vote was cast
<PAGE>

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o    Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:

     The back of the VAF is stamped  indicating  that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent  overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual  legal proxies
and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay messenger charges).  A
lead-time  of at least  two  weeks  prior to the  meeting  is needed to do this.
Alternatively,  the  procedures  detailed  below  for banks not using ADP may be
implemented.

o    Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

     The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A  limited   Power  of  Attorney   appointing   the   attendee  an  Adviser
     representative.
o    A list of all  shares  being  voted by  custodian  only.  Client  names and
     account numbers are not included.  This list must be presented,  along with
     the  proxies,  to the  Inspectors  of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least
     one-half  hour prior to the scheduled  start of the meeting.  The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e.  determine if the vote have  previously been
     cast,  if the votes have been  rescinded,  etc. vote have  previously  been
     cast, etc.).
o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.
o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.
o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

                                PROXY GUIDELINES







PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES




GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our  clients.  As we  state  in  our  Magna  Carta  of  Shareholders  Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

<PAGE>

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Historical responsiveness to shareholders
          This may include such areas as:
          -Paying greenmail
          -Failure to adopt shareholder resolutions receiving a majority of
           shareholder votes
o    Qualifications
o    Nominating committee in place
o    Number of outside directors on the board
o    Attendance at meetings
o    Overall performance

SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for audit.

BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.

CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place we will generally not support  attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.

INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Future use of additional shares
     -Stock split
     -Stock option or other executive compensation plan
     -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet
     -Aid in restructuring
     -Improve credit rating
     -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o    Amount of stock  currently  authorized  but not yet issued or reserved  for
     stock option plans
o    Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.
<PAGE>

DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by- case basis.

NOTE:  CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.

ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.

LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.
<PAGE>

CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o    State of Incorporation

<PAGE>

o    Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o    Other mitigating factors

POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o    Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o    Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o    Method of payment
o    Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing stock
     option plans

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
- -------------------------------

As reflected  above,  the Portfolio  Managers manage accounts in addition to the
Trust.  Actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest  may arise when a Portfolio
Manager also has day-to-day  management  responsibilities with respect to one or
more other accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION  OF LIMITED TIME AND  ATTENTION.  As indicated  above,  the Portfolio
Managers manage multiple accounts.  As a result, they will not be able to devote
all of their time to management of the Trust. The Portfolio Manager,  therefore,
may not be able  to  formulate  as  complete  a  strategy  or  identify  equally
attractive  investment  opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the
case if he were to devote all of his  attention  to the  management  of only the
Trust.
<PAGE>

ALLOCATION  OF  LIMITED  INVESTMENT  OPPORTUNITIES.   As  indicated  above,  the
Portfolio  Managers manage managed  accounts with investment  strategies  and/or
policies  that are similar to the Trust.  In these cases,  if he  identifies  an
investment  opportunity that may be suitable for multiple  accounts,  a Fund may
not be able to take full advantage of that  opportunity  because the opportunity
may be allocated  among all or many of these accounts or other accounts  managed
primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser,  and their affiliates.  In
addition,  in the event the Portfolio Manager  determines to purchase a security
for more than one account in an aggregate  amount that may  influence the market
price of the security,  accounts that  purchased or sold the security  first may
receive a more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions.

SELECTION  OF  BROKER/DEALERS.  Because  of  Mr.  Gabelli's  position  with  the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor,  he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute  portfolio  transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING  STRATEGIES.  At times, the Portfolio Manager may determine
that an investment  opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the accounts
for which he exercises investment responsibility,  or may decide that certain of
the  funds or  accounts  should  take  differing  positions  with  respect  to a
particular  security.  In these  cases,  he may  execute  differing  or opposite
transactions  for one or more accounts  which may affect the market price of the
security or the execution of the  transaction,  or both, to the detriment of one
or more other accounts.

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION.  A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other benefits  available to the Portfolio Managers differ among the accounts
that they  manage.  If the  structure  of the  Adviser's  management  fee or the
Portfolio Manager's  compensation  differs among accounts (such as where certain
accounts pay higher management fees or  performance-based  management fees), the
Portfolio  Manager may be motivated to favor certain  accounts over others.  The
Portfolio  Manager also may be  motivated  to favor  accounts in which he has an
investment  interest,  or  in  which  the  Adviser,  or  their  affiliates  have
investment interests.  Similarly, the desire to maintain assets under management
or to  enhance a  Portfolio  Manager's  performance  record  or to derive  other
rewards,  financial or  otherwise,  could  influence  the  Portfolio  Manager in
affording preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly
benefit the Portfolio Manager. For example, as reflected above, if the Portfolio
Manager  manages  accounts  which have  performance  fee  arrangements,  certain
portions of his  compensation  will  depend on the  achievement  of  performance
milestones on those accounts.  The Portfolio Manager could be incented to afford
preferential  treatment to those  accounts and thereby by subject to a potential
conflict of interest.

The Adviser,  and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser  and their  staff  members.  However,  there is no  guarantee  that such
policies and  procedures  will be able to detect and prevent every  situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI
- -------------------------------------------

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined  by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees the  firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's  compensation)  allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have  arrangements  whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee  attributable  to the  liquidation  value of outstanding  preferred
stock (and Mr.  Gabelli would only receive his  percentage of such advisory fee)
if  certain  performance  levels  are met.  Additionally,  he  receives  similar
incentive  based variable  compensation  for managing other accounts  within the
firm and its  affiliates.  This method of  compensation  is based on the premise
that superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher  compensation  as a result of growth of assets through  appreciation
and net investment  activity.  The level of  compensation is not determined with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  One of the other  registered  investment  companies  managed  by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance  (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his  compensation
is  adjusted  up or down  based on the  performance  of the  investment  company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance  fees.
Compensation  for managing these accounts has two  components.  One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account.  The second component is based on absolute  performance of the account,
with  respect  to  which a  percentage  of such  performance  fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli.  As an executive  officer of the  Adviser's  parent  company,  GBL, Mr.
Gabelli  also  receives ten percent of the net  operating  profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.
<PAGE>

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR CAESAR M. P. BRYAN
- ---------------------------------------------

The  compensation of Mr. Bryan for the Trust is structured to enable the Adviser
to  attract  and  retain  highly   qualified   professionals  in  a  competitive
environment. The Portfolio Manager receives a compensation package that includes
a minimum draw or base salary, equity-based incentive compensation via awards of
stock options,  and incentive based variable  compensation based on a percentage
of net revenue received by the Adviser for managing the Trust to the extent that
the amount exceeds a minimum level of compensation.  Net revenues are determined
by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees  certain  of the firm's
expenses  (other than the  Portfolio  Managers'  compensation)  allocable to the
Trust (the incentive-based  variable compensation for managing other accounts is
also  based on a  percentage  of net  revenues  to the  investment  adviser  for
managing the account).  This method of compensation is based on the premise that
superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded with
higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation and net
investment  activity.  The level of equity-based  incentive and  incentive-based
variable compensation is based on an evaluation by the Adviser's parent, GBL, of
quantitative and qualitative  performance  evaluation criteria.  This evaluation
takes into account, in a broad sense, the performance of the accounts managed by
the Portfolio  Manager,  but the level of  compensation  is not determined  with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  Generally,  greater  consideration  is given to the  performance  of
larger  accounts  and to longer  term  performance  over  smaller  accounts  and
short-term performance.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND
- -------------------------------

Mario Gabelli and Caesar M. P. Bryan owned over $1,000,000 and $0, respectively,
of shares of the Trust as of December 31, 2006.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each  affiliated   registered   investment   company  (each  a
"COMPANY") is committed to conducting  business in  accordance  with  applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate  disclosure -- financial  and otherwise -- in compliance  with
applicable  law.  This  Code  of  Ethics,  applicable  to each  Company's  Chief
Executive Officer,  President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "SENIOR OFFICERS"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer,  you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility  to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have  leadership  responsibilities  that include  creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that  encourages  the  internal  reporting of  compliance  concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics  recognizes  that the Senior  Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies,  because the Senior Officers  currently or may in the future serve as
Senior  Officers  of each of the  Companies,  as officers  or  employees  of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "ADVISOR")
and/or  affiliates  of the  Advisor  (the  "Advisory  Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors  of other  registered  investment  companies and unregistered
investment  funds  advised  by the  Advisory  Group.  This Code of  Ethics  also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and  procedures  adopted by, the  Companies  or the  Advisory  Group govern your
conduct in  connection  with many of the  conflict of interest  situations  that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

         o        the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulation   promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 ACT");

         o        the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "ADVISERS ACT");

         o        the Code of Ethics  adopted by each  Company  pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act  (collectively,  the "TRUST'S 1940
                  ACT CODE OF ETHICS");
<PAGE>

         o        one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been  reviewed and  approved by those  trustees/directors
                  (the  "DIRECTORS")  of each Company  that are not  "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the  "ADVISORY  GROUP'S  1940 ACT
                  CODE OF ETHICS" and,  together  with such  Company's  1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 ACT CODES OF ETHICS");

         o        the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3,   Rule  17a-7  and  Rule  17e-1   under  the  1940  Act
                  (collectively, the "CONFLICT POLICIES"); and

         o        the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other  things,  conflict  of interest  situations  and related
                  matters (collectively, the "ADVISORY POLICIES").

The  provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the  Conflict  Policies  and  the  Advisory  Policies  are  referred  to  herein
collectively as the "ADDITIONAL CONFLICT RULES".

                  This Code of Ethics is  different  from,  and is  intended  to
supplement,  the  Additional  Conflict  Rules.  Accordingly,  a violation of the
Additional  Conflict  Rules by a Senior  Officer  is hereby  deemed  not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional  Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior  Officer has a  responsibility  to each Company to
act with integrity.  Integrity  requires,  among other things,  being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        act with  integrity,  including  being honest and candid while
                  still  maintaining the  confidentiality  of information  where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

         o        comply with the laws,  rules and  regulations  that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's  operations and report any suspected
                  violations  thereof  in  accordance  with  the  section  below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

         o        adhere to a high standard of business ethics.
<PAGE>

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest  for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs  when your  private  interests  interfere  in any way,  or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior  Officers  are expected to use  objective  and unbiased
standards when making  decisions that affect each Company,  keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain  inherent  conflicts of interest  because
Senior  Officers of a Company  also are or may be  officers  of other  Companies
and/or the Advisory  Group (as a result of which it is incumbent  upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner,  including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business  relationships.  When making
any  investment,  accepting  any  position  or  benefits,  participating  in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest  with respect to each Company  where
you are  receiving a personal  benefit,  you should act in  accordance  with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior  Officer  of a Company,  you should  make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and  circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the  Advisory  Group (the  "CCO") and obtain the  approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some  conflict of interest  situations  that should  always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

         o        the receipt of any  entertainment  or non-nominal  gift by the
                  Senior  Officer,  or a member of his or her  family,  from any
                  company  with  which a  Company  has  current  or  prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

         o        a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other  than an  interest  arising  from the  Senior  Officer's
                  employment  by the Advisory  Group,  such as  compensation  or
                  equity ownership.
<PAGE>

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable  disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations  in all reports  and  documents  that such  Company  files with,  or
submits to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or a national  securities
exchange  and in all other  public  communications  made by such  Company.  As a
Senior Officer,  you are required to promote  compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company 's standards,  policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        familiarize   himself   or   herself   with   the   disclosure
                  requirements  applicable  to  each  Company  as  well  as  the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

         o        not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent  auditors,  such Company's counsel,
                  any  counsel  to  the  Independent   Directors,   governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a  violation  of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations,  policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must  report  that  information  on a  timely  basis  to the  CCO or  report  it
anonymously by following the "whistle  blower"  policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

         o        the CCO will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

         o        violations  and potential  violations  will be reported to the
                  Board  of  Directors  of  each  affected  Company  after  such
                  investigation;

         o        if the Board of  Directors  determines  that a  violation  has
                  occurred,  it  will  take  all  appropriate   disciplinary  or
                  preventive action; and

         o        appropriate  disciplinary  or preventive  action may include a
                  letter of censure,  suspension,  dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious  violations of law,  notification of
                  the  Securities and Exchange  Commission or other  appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.
<PAGE>

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

of Ethics in any particular  situation.  The CCO shall take all action he or she
considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported

                  Code of Ethics; and
