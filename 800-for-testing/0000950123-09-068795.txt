NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2009 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
          LLC (the  "Company")  was  organized as a Delaware  limited  liability
          company on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
          Investment  Company  Act of 1940 (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
          closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company
          is also registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").

          The  investment  objective  of  the  Company  is  to  achieve  capital
          appreciation   principally   through  investing  in  investment  funds
          ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by  third-party   investment  managers
          ("Investment   Managers")   that  employ  a  variety  of   alternative
          investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies allow Investment
          Managers the  flexibility  to use leverage or short-side  positions to
          take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies across the global markets,
          often referred to as alternative strategies.  Because Investment Funds
          following  alternative  investment  strategies are often  described as
          hedge funds, the investment program of the Company can be described as
          a fund of hedge funds.

          Shares  of the  Company  ("Shares")  are  sold to  eligible  investors
          (referred to as "Shareholders"). The minimum initial investment in the
          Company  from each  Shareholder  is $25,000;  the  minimum  additional
          investment is $10,000.

          Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or the  "Adviser"),  a
          Delaware  limited  liability  company and an  indirect,  wholly  owned
          subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as the  Company's  investment
          adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
          Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and, among other things,
          is responsible  for the allocation of the Company's  assets to various
          Investment Funds. Under the Company's governing documents, the Company
          has delegated substantially all authority to oversee the management of
          the  operations  and assets of the  Company to the Board of  Directors
          (the "Board").

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
          principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP")
          requires the Adviser to makes  estimates and  assumptions  that affect
          the  amounts  and   disclosures   in  the  financial   statements  and
          accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates  utilized
          in preparing  its financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
          however, actual results could differ from those estimates.

          Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms of the
          respective limited partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
          agreements,  offering  memoranda and such negotiated  "side letter" or
          similar  arrangements  as the Adviser may have  entered  into with the
          Investment  Fund on behalf of the  Company.  The Company  values these
          investments at fair value.

          The net asset  value of the Company is  determined  as of the close of
          business  at the end of each month in  accordance  with the  valuation
          principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to time
          pursuant to policies established by the Board.

          The  Company's  investments  in  Investment  Funds are carried at fair
          value as  determined  by the  Company's  pro-rata  interest in the net
          assets of each Investment Fund.

          All  valuations  utilize  financial   information   supplied  by  each
          Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
          fees or other allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers as
          required by the Investment Funds' agreements.  Each Investment Manager
          to which the Adviser  allocates assets will charge the Company,  as an
          investor in an underlying  Investment  Fund, an  asset-based  fee, and
          some or all of the Investment Managers will receive  performance-based
          compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of
          the Investment  Managers are generally expected to range from 1% to 3%
          annually of the net assets under their  management  and the  incentive
          fee is  generally  expected  to range  from 15% to 25% of net  profits
          annually.  These  fees  are not  included  in  management  fees on the
          Statement of Operations.

          The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate  certain
          investments  within those Investment  Funds,  typically those that are
          especially  illiquid  and/or  hard to value,  as  "special  situation"
          (often called  "Side-Pocket")  investments with additional  redemption
          limitations.  Such a Side-Pocket  is, in effect,  similar to a private
          equity fund that  requires its  investors  to remain  invested for the
          duration of the fund and  distributes  returns on the investment  only
          when liquid assets are generated  within the fund,  typically  through
          the sale of the fund's illiquid assets in exchange for cash.

          As a general matter, the fair value of the Company's  investment in an
          Investment  Fund represents the amount that the Company can reasonably
          expect to receive if the Company's  investment  was sold in an orderly
          transaction at the time of valuation. The Investment Funds provide for
          periodic  redemptions  ranging from  monthly to  annually.  Investment
          Funds generally  require  advance notice of a shareholder's  intent to
          redeem its  interest,  and may,  depending  on the  Investment  Funds'
          governing agreements,  deny or delay a redemption request. The Company
          considers  if a liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Fund should be
          taken due to redemption  restrictions or suspensions by the Investment
          Fund.  However,  the effects of any discounts  were  determined by the
          Adviser to be insignificant  at September 30, 2009, and therefore,  no
          discounts were applied to the fair value of the Investment  Funds. The
          underlying  investments of each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at
          fair  value  as  described  in  each   Investment   Fund's   financial
          statements.  The Investment Funds may invest a portion of their assets
          in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid.

          Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value might be made
          after the  valuation  date which could  impact the net asset value per
          Share at which  Shareholders  purchase or sell Shares.  The valuations
          reported by the Investment  Funds,  upon which the Company  calculates
          its month end net asset value, may be subject to adjustment subsequent
          to the valuation date,  based on information  which becomes  available
          after that  valuation  date.  For example,  fiscal  year-end net asset
          values of an Investment  Fund may be revised as a result of a year-end
          audit performed by the independent  auditors of that Investment  Fund.
          Other adjustments to the Company's net asset value may also occur from
          time to time,  such as from the  misapplication  by the Company or its
          agents of the valuation policies described in the Company's  valuation
          procedures.

          Retroactive  adjustments  to the Company's net asset value,  which are
          caused  by  adjustments  to  the  Investment  Funds'  values  or  by a
          misapplication of the Company's valuation  policies,  that are able to
          be  made  within  90  days  of the  Valuation  Date(s)  to  which  the
          adjustment would apply will be made automatically unless determined to
          be de minimis. Other potential retroactive adjustments,  regardless of
          whether  their impact  increases or decreases  the Company's net asset
          value,   will  be  made  only  if  they  both  (i)  are  caused  by  a
          misapplication of the Company's  valuation policies and (ii) deemed to
          be material. All retroactive adjustments are reported to the Company's
          Valuation Committee and to affected Shareholders.

          Effective  June 30, 2009,  the Company  adopted a policy which permits
          revisions to the number of shares  purchased  or sold by  shareholders
          due to retroactive  adjustments made under the circumstances described
          above which occur within 90 days of the Valuation Date.  Prior to June
          30, 2009, that automatic  90-day  adjustment  period was not in effect
          and retroactive valuation or share adjustments were not made.

          In circumstances where a retroactive  adjustment is not made under the
          circumstances   described   above,   Shares   purchased   or  sold  by
          Shareholders will not be adjusted. As a result, to the extent that the
          subsequent  impact  of the  event  which  was not  adjusted  adversely
          affects the Company's net asset value, the outstanding  Shares will be
          adversely  affected by prior repurchases made at a net asset value per
          Share higher than the adjusted value. Conversely, any increases in net
          asset value per Share resulting from such subsequent impact will be to
          the  benefit  of the  holders  of the  outstanding  Shares  and to the
          detriment of Shareholders who previously had their Shares  repurchased
          at a net asset value per Share lower than the post-impact  value.  New
          Shareholders  may be  affected  in a  similar  way,  because  the same
          principles apply to the purchase of Shares.

          B.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

          Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual basis. Income,
          expenses  and realized  and  unrealized  gains and losses are recorded
          monthly.

          The change in an Investment  Fund's net asset value is included in net
          change in unrealized  appreciation on investments in Investment  Funds
          on the Statement of Operations. The Company records a realized gain or
          loss on its investment in Investment Funds only to the extent that the
          cost of such  investment  as well as any Side  Pocket  has been  fully
          recovered through previous  redemptions from investments in Investment
          Funds.

          The  Company  bears  all  expenses  incurred  in  the  course  of  its
          operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all costs
          and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions for the
          Company's account; professional fees; costs of insurance; registration
          expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board of Directors.

          C.   INCOME TAXES

          The Company operated as a partnership from inception through September
          30, 2005. As of October 1, 2005, the Company became a corporation that
          is taxed as a regulated investment company.

          It is the Company's intention to meet the requirements of the Internal
          Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies (RIC) and
          distribute  substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
          capital  gains,  if any,  to  Shareholders  each year.  Therefore,  no
          federal  income or excise tax  provision is required for the Company's
          financial   statements.   While  the  Company  intends  to  distribute
          substantially  all of its  taxable net  investment  income and capital
          gains,  in the manner  necessary to avoid  imposition of the 4% excise
          tax as described  above,  it is possible  that some excise tax will be
          incurred.  In such event,  the Company will be liable for the tax only
          on the  amount  by which it does not meet the  foregoing  distribution
          requirements.

          Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in  Income  Taxes  set  forth a  minimum
          threshold for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of a tax
          position  taken or expected  to be taken in a tax return.  The Company
          has analyzed tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course
          of preparing  the  Company's tax return for all open tax years and has
          concluded, as of September 30, 2009, no provision for income tax would
          be required in the Company's financial statements.  The Company is not
          aware of any tax position for which it is reasonably possible that the
          total amounts of unrecognized tax benefit would  significantly  change
          in the next twelve months.  The Company's federal and state income and
          federal  excise  tax  returns  for tax years for which the  applicable
          statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by
          the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue.

          D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash  and cash  equivalents  consist  of cash on  deposit  and  monies
          invested in money market  deposit  accounts  that are accounted for at
          amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

          E.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with GAAP
          requires  management of the Company to make estimates and  assumptions
          that  affect the  amounts  reported in the  financial  statements  and
          accompanying  notes.  Changes in the economic  environment,  financial
          markets,  and any other parameters used in determining these estimates
          could cause actual results to differ materially.

     3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

          In  accordance   with  the   authoritative   guidance  on  fair  value
          measurements  and  disclosures  under GAAP, the Company  discloses the
          fair value of its  investments  in a hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the
          inputs to  valuation  techniques  used to measure the fair value.  The
          hierarchy  gives  the  highest   priority  to  valuations  based  upon
          unadjusted  quoted prices in active  markets for  identical  assets or
          liabilities   (level  1  measurement)   and  the  lowest  priority  to
          valuations based upon unobservable  inputs that are significant to the
          valuation (level 3 measurement.  The guidance establishes three levels
          of fair value as listed below.

          Level 1-  Inputs  that  reflect  unadjusted  quoted  prices  in active
          markets for identical  assets or liabilities  that the Company has the
          ability to access at the measurement date;

          Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices that are  observable  for the
          asset or liability either directly or indirectly,  including inputs in
          markets that are not considered to be active;

          Level 3- Inputs that are unobservable.

          The notion of unobservable  inputs is intended to allow for situations
          in which there is little,  if any,  market  activity  for the asset or
          liability  at the  measurement  date.  Under  Level 3, the owner of an
          asset must determine valuation based on its own assumptions about what
          market  participants  would take into account in determining  the fair
          value of the asset, using the best information available.

          The  inputs  or  methodology  used  for  valuing  securities  are  not
          necessarily  an indication of the risk  associated  with  investing in
          those securities.

          Effective  January 1, 2009,  the  Company  adopted  the  authoritative
          guidance  under  GAAP on  determining  fair  value when the volume and
          level of  activity  for the  asset  or  liability  have  significantly
          decreased  and   identifying   transactions   that  are  not  orderly.
          Accordingly,  if the Company  determines that either the volume and/or
          level  of  activity  for  an  asset  or  liability  has  significantly
          decreased  (from normal  conditions  for that asset or  liability)  or
          price quotations or observable  inputs are not associated with orderly
          transactions,  increased  analysis  and  management  judgment  will be
          required  to  estimate  fair value.  Valuation  techniques  such as an
          income approach might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market
          approach in those circumstances.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The  guidance  also  provides a list of factors to  determine  whether
          there has been a  significant  decrease in  relation to normal  market
          activity.  Regardless,  however, of the valuation technique and inputs
          used,   the  objective  for  the  fair  value   measurement  in  those
          circumstances  is  unchanged  from  what it would be if  markets  were
          operating at normal activity levels and/or  transactions were orderly;
          that is, to determine the current exit price.

          A financial  instrument's  level  within the fair value  hierarchy  is
          based upon the lowest  level of any input that is  significant  to the
          fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes
          "observable" requires significant judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser
          considers   observable  data  to  be  market  data  which  is  readily
          available,  regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable,
          not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively
          involved in the relevant  market.  The inputs or methodology  used for
          valuing  securities  are not  necessarily  an  indication  of the risk
          associated with investing in those securities.

          The  following  is a summary of the inputs  used as of  September  30,
          2009, in valuing the Company's assets and liabilities  carried at fair
          value:

          OTHER

          The Adviser provides certain management and administrative services to
          the  Company.  The  Adviser  acts  primarily  to  evaluate  and select
          Investment  Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply risk
          management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment performance.
          In addition,  the Adviser also provides office space and other support
          services. In consideration for such services, the Company will pay the
          Adviser a monthly  management fee of 0.125% (1.5%  annually)  based on
          end of month Shareholder's capital.

          Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to assist in the
          placement of the Company's Shares. A placement agent will generally be
          entitled to receive a fee from each  Shareholder  in the Company whose
          Shares the agent places. The specific amount of the placement fee paid
          with respect to a  Shareholder  is generally  dependent on the size of
          the investment in the Company.

          Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. ("CGMI"), an affiliate of CAI serves as
          a  placement  agent  of the  Company's  shares  (and  CAI and CGMI are
          affiliates  of Morgan  Stanley  Smith  Barney LLC,  with whom CGMI has
          entered  into a  sub-placement  agency  agreement  with respect to the
          Company).  For the six months ended  September  30, 2009,  the Company
          paid $497,597 in placement fees to CGMI on the Company's Shares.  Such
          fees are deducted from a Shareholder's gross contribution amount.

     6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

          Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for Shares may be
          accepted as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by
          the  Board  of the  Company  to  accept  or  reject  any  initial  and
          additional  subscriptions  for Shares in the  Company.  The Board from
          time  to  time  and in its  complete  and  exclusive  discretion,  may
          determine to cause the Company to repurchase  Shares from Shareholders
          pursuant  to  written  tenders  by  Shareholders  on  such  terms  and
          conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects that it typically  will
          recommend  to the Board that the Company  offer to  repurchase  Shares
          from Shareholders  quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30, September 30
          and  December 31 (or,  if any such date is not a business  day, on the

     7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

          In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the

          various  investment  activities  with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These
          include,  but are not limited to, short  selling  activities,  writing
          option contracts and entering into equity swaps. The Company's risk of
          loss in  these  investment  funds  is  limited  to the  value  of its'
          investment in the respective Investment Funds.

     8.   REDEMPTION PENALTY

          During the six months  ended  September  30,  2009,  the Company  paid
          redemption penalties totaling $288,132.  The redemption penalties were
          charged  to  the  Company  for  redeeming  its  interests  of  certain
          Investment  Funds  prior  to  the  expiration  of  applicable  lock-up
          periods.  The payment of these penalties released the Company from any
          further  liability for its  investments in the  applicable  Investment
          Funds and is  recorded as an  operating  expense in the  Statement  of
          Operations.
