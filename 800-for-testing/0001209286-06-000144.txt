May 15, 2006

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the annual report for Insured Municipal
Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.

PERFORMANCE

Over the one-year period, the Fund returned 4.29% on a net asset value basis and
9.51% on a market price basis. Over the same period, the median returns for the
Fund's peer group, the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged), were
4.70% and 9.21% based on net asset value and market price, respectively.
Finally, the Fund's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the
"Index"), returned 3.81% for the period. (For more performance information,
please refer to "Performance at a Glance" on page 6.)

The Fund continued to use leverage during the period, which was approximately
40% of total assets as of March 31, 2006. While short-term rates rose over the
period and increased the Fund's borrowing costs, this leverage still had a
positive effect on the Fund's income during the reporting period, as the yields
on the Fund's longer-term bonds more than offset the borrowing costs. Leverage
magnifies returns on both the upside and on the downside, creating a wider range
of returns within the Fund's peer group.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER KEVIN McINTYRE

Q. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A. Over the past 12 months, the US economy continued to strengthen, although it
   was forced to absorb some rather significant blows during the late summer
   and early fall. Energy prices, which were high throughout the year, were
   exacerbated after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast, seriously
   impairing the country's oil refining capacity and causing an estimated $100
   billion in damage. Shortly after

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               1

   Labor Day, oil broke $70 a barrel and gasoline topped an average of $3.00 per
   gallon nationwide.

   Beginning in October, however, economic data took a turn for the better.
   Unemployment--despite large numbers of dislocated workers in the wake of
   Katrina--trended downward throughout the year, finishing the period at 4.7%,
   down from 5.1% in March 2005. Consumer confidence was particularly volatile
   during this period, but finished the year strong. Finally, GDP remained
   relatively solid throughout the period. Although final data put fourth
   quarter 2005 GDP growth at 1.7%, advance estimates for the first quarter of
   2006 showed a significant rebound, with the economy growing at 4.8%, the
   highest it has been in nearly three years.

Q. HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THESE ECONOMIC
   CONDITIONS?

A. The Fed--headed by its new chairman, Ben Bernanke--continued its tightening
   campaign, raising the federal funds rate 25 basis points on eight separate
   occasions during the reporting period, and once more after the period ended,
   bringing the rate to 5.00%. (The federal funds rate is the interest rate
   banks charge each other for overnight loans.)

   The market consensus seems to be that the Fed may be near the end of this
   current tightening policy (the Fed has raised rates at 16 consecutive
   meetings since June 2004). While we can't be certain exactly when the Fed
   will pause or end its current policy, we believe it is unlikely that 2006
   will be the year of uninterrupted rate increases that 2005 was.

Q. HOW DID THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET PERFORM IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?

A. The municipal bond market on the whole outperformed Treasuries throughout the
   past year. Although municipal bonds saw their yields rise along with
   Treasuries' during the year, on a percentage basis, their performance was
   stronger. This outperformance was most significant on the longer end of the
   yield curve. The 30-year area of the curve, in fact, was the best-performing
   segment of the municipal bond market during the reporting period. The one
   exception to municipal bonds' outperformance trend was in issues on the short
   end of the curve, which lagged similarly dated Treasuries.

Q. IN GENERAL TERMS, HOW DID YOU POSITION THE PORTFOLIO?

A. Over the past year, we believed that yields would continue to rise in concert
   with the Fed's tightening cycle, and as a result, we maintained a defensive
   duration position. During this period we opportunistically extended our
   duration approximately one year in order to better position

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

   the Fund versus its peer group and the Index. In terms of yield-curve
   positioning, we continued to overweight securities with maturities of 20
   years and longer, and decreased our position in the 10- to 15-year area of
   the curve. Both moves benefited the portfolio on an absolute basis, as the
   longer end of the curve performed better than other areas, including the
   intermediate area. However, the Fund's peers held a larger exposure to the
   30-year area of the curve, and this detracted somewhat from the Fund's
   relative performance.

Q. FROM A SECTOR STANDPOINT, WHAT WERE IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR THE FUND?

A. We strive to maintain a well-diversified portfolio regardless of market
   conditions, and as a result, the Fund holds bonds in a number of different
   industry sectors and subsectors. Over the past year, however, we focused
   particularly on the water and airport sectors. Our research indicates that
   the water sector tends to have stronger revenue and earnings stability than
   some other sectors of the municipal market, even in changing economic
   climates. We found relative value in the water sector versus other sectors,
   and given the sector's relative stability, we added selectively to positions
   there, making it the Fund's largest sector position.

   Meanwhile, the airport sector continued to rebound during the period. A
   significant portion of airport sector bonds are subject to the Alternative
   Minimum Tax (AMT), and tend to offer higher yields. During the period, we
   purchased NYC IDA revenue bonds for the Terminal One Group Association. The
   bonds are rated A3/BBB+, are subject to AMT and have performed well over this
   period. In addition, these bonds helped us to diversify the credit quality of
   the portfolio. At period end, airport bonds represented 8.4% of the Fund's
   total investments, up from 3.3% six months ago.

   While our long-term outlook for the healthcare sector as a whole remains
   negative, we see positive trends developing for certain healthcare providers
   that have stable or improving finances and strong market share. With that in
   mind, we have selectively added to our holdings in this sector, and
   performance has been solid in recent months. Nonetheless, we remained
   underweight to the sector on the whole, which ultimately detracted from
   relative returns.

   Although the tobacco sector posted very strong performance again during the
   reporting period, we continued to avoid it, which detracted from performance
   during the period. We do not believe the potential rewards in the tobacco
   sector are commensurate with the risks our analysis indicates these bonds
   entail. In an attempt to concentrate Fund

   assets on risks we feel are likely to be compensated, we minimized our
   exposure to the sector.

Q. DID THE FUND FOCUS ON ANY SPECIFIC STATES OR REGIONS?

A. From a regional standpoint, we continued to focus on states that exhibited
   improved fiscal health and offered attractively valued municipal bonds.
   Issues that we believe met that definition included long-term California
   bonds and New York securities. While we continued to find opportunities in
   Texas, we found New York bonds particularly attractive during the year and
   increased our exposure rather significantly. These three states combined
   represented nearly 60% of the Fund's total investments as of period end.

Q. WHAT FACTORS DO YOU BELIEVE WILL AFFECT THE FUND OVER THE COMING MONTHS?

A. We will continue to monitor a number of factors, including inflation and the
   overall strength of the economy, both of which will likely play a role in the
   Fed's future decisions on interest rates. The direction and magnitude of
   interest rate changes will continue to play a significant role in our
   duration strategy, as we seek to mitigate the effects of rising rates on the
   portfolio. Overall, the portfolio remains well diversified, and we anticipate
   continuing to seek out tax-advantaged yield opportunities while maintaining
   liquidity.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is
to achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income
tax, consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that
the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

In the normal course of business the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations or that provide indemnification for certain
liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not
yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Fund's management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use last reported
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a good
faith determination of a security's fair value. These factors may include, but
are not limited to, the type and cost of the security; contractual or legal
restrictions on resale of the security; relevant financial or business
developments of the issuer; actively traded similar or related securities;
conversion or exchange rights on the security;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

related corporate actions; and changes in overall market conditions. If events
occur that materially affect the value of securities (particularly non-U.S.
securities) between the close of trading in those securities and the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the securities are fair valued.
The amortized cost method of valuation, which approximates market value,
generally is used to value short-term debt instruments with sixty days or less
remaining to maturity, unless the Board determines that this does not represent
fair value. Securities traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market are valued
at the last bid price available on the valuation date prior to valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

FUTURES CONTRACTS--Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is
required to deposit in a separate account with the futures broker through which
the transaction was effected an amount of cash and/or securities equal to a
certain percentage of the contract amount. This amount is known as the "initial
margin". Subsequent payments, known as "variation margin", are made or received
by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the
underlying financial futures contracts. Such variation margin is recorded for
financial statement purposes on a daily basis as unrealized gain or loss until
the financial futures contract is closed, at which time the net gain or loss is
reclassified to realized gain or loss on futures. Variation margin calls could
be substantial in the event of adverse price movements.

Using financial futures contracts involves various market risks. If the Fund was
unable to liquidate a futures position due to the absence of a liquid secondary
market or the imposition of price limits, it could incur substantial losses and
would continue to be subject to market risk with respect to the position. In
addition, the Fund would continue to be required to make variation margin
payments and might be required to maintain the position being hedged or to
maintain cash or securities in a separate account. Furthermore, certain
characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with
movements in the prices of the investments being hedged, including temporary
price distortion. The separate account

for margin will be maintained at the futures counterparty and may be subject to
risks or delays if the counterparty becomes insolvent.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS--The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
agreements for hedging purposes and to seek to increase the return of the Fund.
This type of swap is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange a
series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or calculated by
reference to a specified interest rate(s) for a specified amount. The payment
flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being paid by
one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the contract. The loss incurred by the
failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
received by the Fund. Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of the
counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.

The Fund accrues for interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis, with
the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation on swap
contracts in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Once interim payments are
settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in
addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of swap contracts
in the Statement of Operations. Fluctuations in the value of swap contracts are
recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation of swaps.

At March 31, 2006, the Fund had a forward interest rate swap whose effective
date of the exchange of cash flows is May 22, 2006 with the following terms:

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders at a rate level that over time will result in the distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend rate on the common
stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund.
Dividends and distributions to common

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction
preferred shareholders are accrued daily. The amount of dividends from net
investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains is
determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ
from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These "book/tax" differences
are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these
differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board had approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM"), under which UBS Global AM had served as investment advisor and
administrator of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset
management subsidiary of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization
with headquarters in Zurich and Basel, Switzerland and operations in many areas
of the financial services industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract,
the Fund paid UBS Global AM an investment advisory and administration fee, which
was accrued weekly and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred
shares. UBS Global AM had agreed to waive 0.30% of the advisory and
administration fee, so that the Fund's effective fee was 0.60% of average weekly
net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred shares. This
waiver continued indefinitely unless the Board agreed to any change. At March
31, 2006, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $263,496, which is composed of $395,243 of
investment advisory and administration fees less fees waived of $131,747. For
the year ended March 31, 2006, UBS Global AM waived $1,562,674 of investment
advisory and administration fees from the Fund. (After the end of the fiscal
period, the Advisory Contract was transferred to an affiliate of UBS Global AM
as explained in the Subsequent Event note further below.)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMPENSATION TO AFFILIATE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Effective March 1, 2005, Professor Meyer Feldberg accepted the position of
senior advisor to Morgan Stanley, resulting in him becoming an interested
director of the Fund. The Fund has been informed that Professor Feldberg's role
at Morgan Stanley does not involve matters directly affecting any UBS funds.
Fund transactions are executed through Morgan Stanley based on that firm's
ability to provide best execution of the transactions. During the year ended
March 31, 2006, the Fund purchased and sold certain securities (e.g., fixed
income securities) in principal trades with Morgan Stanley having an aggregate
value of $106,633,007. Morgan Stanley received compensation in connection with
these trades, which may have been in the form of a "mark-up" or "mark-down" of
the price of the securities, a fee from the issuer for maintaining a commercial
paper program, or some other form of compensation. Although the precise amount
of this compensation is not generally known by UBS Global AM, UBS Global AM
believes that under normal circumstances it represents a small portion of the
total value of the transactions. In addition, Morgan Stanley may participate as
a broker-dealer in auctions for the Fund's Auction Preferred Shares and receive
compensation therefore. Amounts received by Morgan Stanley, if any, will vary
depending upon that firm's participation in an auction, and such amounts are
calculated and paid by the auction agent from money provided by the Fund.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of auction preferred shares Series A, 800 shares
of auction preferred shares Series B, 800 shares of auction preferred shares
Series C, 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series D, 600 shares of auction
preferred shares Series E and 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series F,
which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." All shares of each
series of APS have a liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount
equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends and/or capital gain distributions, which are cumulative, are generally
reset every 7 days for each Series of APS. Dividend rates ranged from 1.890% to
3.250% and capital gain distribution rates ranged from 2.000% to 5.250% for the
year ended March 31, 2006.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32
<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the year ended March 31, 2006, aggregate purchases and sales of portfolio
securities, excluding short-term securities, were $301,019,203 and $275,669,131,
respectively.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income, net
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2006 and March 31, 2005 were as follows:

To reflect reclassifications arising from permanent "book/tax" differences for
the year ended March 31, 2006, the Fund's undistributed net investment income
was decreased by $389,428 and accumulated net realized loss from investment
activities and futures was decreased by $389,428.

These differences are primarily due to premium amortization adjustments.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

After the end of the fiscal period covered by this report, the investment
advisory and administration contract (the "Advisory and Administration
Contract") between the Fund and UBS Global AM was transferred to UBS Global
Asset Management (Americas) Inc. ("UBS Global AM (Americas)"), a sister company
of UBS Global AM.

In connection with an internal reorganization involving UBS Global AM and UBS
Global AM (Americas), the Fund's Board of Directors approved the transfer of the
Advisory and Administration Contract from UBS Global AM to UBS Global AM
(Americas) effective April 1, 2006. All of the personnel of UBS Global AM who
previously provided investment advisory services to the Fund continue to provide
investment advisory services to the Fund as employees of UBS Global AM
(Americas). UBS Global AM (Americas) has the same contractual rights and
responsibilities under the Advisory and Administration Contract as those
previously held by UBS Global AM. The related fee waiver arrangement disclosed
above continues in effect, but now with UBS Global AM (Americas). UBS Global AM
and UBS Global AM (Americas) are both indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of UBS
AG.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ERNST & YOUNG LLP

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Insured
Municipal Income Fund Inc.(the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments,
as of March 31, 2006, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets applicable to common shareholders
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of March 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. at March 31, 2006, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets applicable to
common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") under
which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names, or
in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have all
dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock automatically
reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such common shareholders
elect to receive cash. Common shareholders who elect to hold their shares in the
name of another broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether, or how, they may participate in the Plan. The ability of such
shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if their shares are
transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time. Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should include the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the
share certificate or in the transfer agent's records. An election to terminate
participation in the Plan, until such election is changed, will be deemed an
election by a common shareholder to take all subsequent distributions in cash.
An election will be effective only for

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONCLUDED)

distributions declared and having a record date at least ten days after the date
on which the election is received.

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend payable
to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including applicable
brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in the open
market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in connection
with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for reinvesting
dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However, each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with respect to any
dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution. The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc., P.O.Box 43027, Providence,
Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331 1710.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

BACKGROUND--At a meeting of the board of Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the
"Fund") on February 8, 2006, the members of the board, including the board
members who are not "interested persons" of the Fund ("Independent Directors"),
as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, considered and
approved the transfer of the current Investment Advisory and Administration
Agreement between the Fund and UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS
Global AM") to UBS Global Asset Management (Americas) Inc. ("UBS Global
Americas"), an affiliate of UBS Global AM. The board received information and
materials about the proposed transfer both at its November 2005 meeting and at
its February 2006 meeting. In considering the approval of the transfer of the
Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement (such transfer referred to as
the "New Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement"), the board reviewed
a memorandum from UBS Global AM explaining the reasons for the proposed
transfer, including that the transfer would result in management efficiencies
and eliminate the duplication of functions that had resulted from having two
registered investment advisors, UBS Global AM and UBS Global Americas, providing
investment advisory services to the UBS funds. The board also reviewed material
provided by UBS Global AM on UBS Global Americas, including that the current
portfolio manager for the Fund would not change as a result of the transfer from
UBS Global AM to UBS Global Americas. The board also noted management's
explanation that any expenses resulting from the transfer would be borne by UBS
Global AM, and not the Fund. The board also received and reviewed a draft of an
opinion to be provided by Dechert LLP, counsel to the Fund, that the proposed
transfer would not be considered an "assignment" of the existing investment
advisory contract under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, because
(1) there would be no change of actual control of the investment advisor to the
Fund; (2) there would be no change of management of the investment advisor to
the Fund; (3) the nature, quality and extent of the investment advisory services
provided by UBS Global AM under the current Investment Advisory and
Administration Agreement would not change as a result of the transfer; (4) the
transfer would not result in any change in the fundamental investment processes,
investment strategies or investment techniques currently employed by UBS Global
AM portfolio managers or other investment professionals in providing services to
the Fund; and (5) there would be no change to any of the material terms of the
Investment Advisory and Administration Agreements as a result of the transfer.
The board took note of its knowledge of UBS Global AM and its

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

affiliates, including UBS Global Americas, and the current Investment Advisory
and Administration Agreement for the Fund, including the extensive materials it
had reviewed at its annual contract renewal meeting in the summer of 2005 for
the Fund, and noted that it had at that time received a memorandum from its
independent legal counsel discussing, among other things, the duties of board
members in considering approval of advisory and administration agreements.

In its consideration of the approval of the New Investment Advisory and
Administration Agreement, the board considered the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT--The board took note that at its last annual contract
renewal meeting for the Fund, in connection with its review of the Fund's
advisory and distribution agreements, it had received and considered extensive
information regarding the nature, extent and quality of management services
generally provided to the Fund by UBS Global AM under the Investment Advisory
and Administration Agreement, and a description of the administrative and other
services rendered to the Fund and its shareholders by UBS Global AM and UBS
Global AM's role in coordinating providers of other services to the Fund,
including custody, accounting and transfer agency services. The board
considered management's explanation that UBS Global Americas would provide
identical services under the New Investment Advisory and Administration
Agreement as were provided by UBS Global AM under the current Investment
Advisory and Administration Agreement. The board's evaluation of the services to
be provided by UBS Global Americas to the Fund took into account the board's
knowledge and familiarity gained as board members of funds in the UBS New York
fund complex, including the scope and quality of investment management and other
capabilities and the quality of administrative and other services, and
considered that based on the materials presented to them these services would
remain the same. The board also considered, based on its knowledge of UBS Global
AM and UBS Global Americas, the financial resources available to UBS Global
Americas and its parent organization, UBS AG, one of the leading financial
services companies in the world.

The board concluded that, overall, it was satisfied with the nature, extent and
quality of services expected to be provided to the Fund under the New Investment
Advisory and Administration Agreement.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

MANAGEMENT FEES--The board noted that the current contractual management fee for
the Fund under the current Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement was
not proposed to be changed under the New Investment Advisory and Administration
Agreement. The board also considered that at its most recent annual contract
renewal meeting during the summer of 2005 it had received and reviewed
information on the contractual management fee payable by the Fund to UBS Global
AM, including information of management fees paid by comparable funds. The board
recognized that the current fee arrangements would not change as a result of the
transfer. It also was noted that UBS Global Americas would continue the current
fee waiver arrangements.

Taking all of the above into consideration, the board determined that the
proposed contractual management fee was reasonable in light of the nature,
extent and quality of the services proposed to be provided to the Fund under the
New Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement.

FUND PERFORMANCE--The board took into consideration the reports on Fund
performance received by the board at each meeting and the more extensive review
and discussion of Fund performance at its most recent annual contract renewal
meeting. The board also noted that the transfer would not result in any change
in the fundamental investment processes, investment strategies or investment
techniques of the Fund and that no changes in the current Fund personnel
overseeing Fund management were proposed or anticipated as a result of the
transfer.

Based on its prior review and the more updated performance information provided,
the board concluded that the Fund's investment performance was satisfactory.

ADVISOR PROFITABILITY--As UBS Global Americas would be a new advisor to the
Fund, profitability of UBS Global Americas in providing services to the Fund was
not a primary factor considered by the board. The board did note that at its
most recent annual contract renewal meeting it received and considered a
profitability analysis of UBS Global AM and its affiliates in providing services
to the Fund and had determined at that time that UBS Global AM's profitability
was considered not excessive in light of the nature, extent and quality of the
services provided to the Fund. The board also recognized that the management fee
would not change as a result of the transfer and the services provided to the
Fund by UBS Global Americas would be identical to those currently provided by
UBS Global AM, making

the profitability data received at its last contract renewal meeting still of
some relevance. UBS Global AM also noted that a significant benefit of the
transfer of the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement to UBS Global
Americas was to reduce a regulatory capital requirement imposed on UBS Global
AM, which was expected to permit the eventual transfer of certain financial
assets owned by UBS Global AM to satisfy regulatory requirements to other parts
of UBS AG for other corporate purposes.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE--The board noted that it had previously considered whether
economies of scale in the provision of services to the Fund would be passed
along to the shareholders during its most recent consideration of the annual
renewal of the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement and did not see
the need to reconsider this factor again in the context of the transfer of the
agreement to a sister investment advisor.

OTHER BENEFITS TO UBS GLOBAL AMERICAS--The board considered other benefits
received by UBS Global Americas and its affiliates as a result of its proposed
relationship with the Fund, including the potential opportunity to offer
additional products and services to Fund shareholders. The board also considered
the benefits to be realized when certain assets of UBS Global AM were freed from
certain regulatory requirements and were available to be paid as a dividend from
one part of UBS AG to another part of UBS AG for such purposes as UBS AG deemed
appropriate.

In light of the costs of providing investment management, administrative and
other services to the Fund and UBS Global America's expected ongoing commitment
to the Fund, the profits and other ancillary benefits that UBS Global Americas
and its affiliates received or would receive were considered reasonable.

In light of all of the foregoing, the board approved the New Investment Advisory
and Administration Agreement for the Fund.

No single factor reviewed by the board was identified by the board as the
principal factor in determining whether to approve the New Investment Advisory
and Administration Agreement. The Independent Directors were advised by separate
independent legal counsel throughout the process. The board discussed the
proposed approval of the New Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement in
a private session with their independent legal counsel at which no
representatives of UBS Global AM or UBS Global Americas were present.

          aggregate Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) audit fees for professional
          services rendered to the registrant were approximately $38,500 and
          $37,300, respectively.

          Fees included in the audit fees category are those associated with
          the annual audits of financial statements and services that are
          normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings.

      (b) Audit-Related Fees:
          ------------------
          In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005,
          the aggregate audit-related fees billed by E&Y for services rendered
          to the registrant that are reasonably related to the performance of
          the audits of the financial statements, but not reported as audit
          fees, were approximately $8,712 and $12,500, respectively.

          Fees included in the audit-related category are those associated with
          (1) the reading and providing of comments on the 2005 and 2004
          semiannual financial statements, (2) review of the consolidated 2004
          and 2003 report on the profitability of the UBS Funds to UBS Global

          assist the board members in their annual advisory/administration
          contract reviews and (3) auction preferred shares testing for the
          registrant's fiscal years ended 2006 and 2005.

          rendered to the registrant were approximately $12,075 and $8,600,
          respectively.

          Fees included in the tax fees category comprise all services
          performed by professional staff in the independent accountant's tax
          division except those services related to the audits. This category
          comprises fees for review of tax compliance, tax return preparation
          and excise tax calculations.

          There were no tax fees required to be approved pursuant to paragraph
          (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the fiscal years

          --------------
          In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005,
          there were no fees billed by E&Y for products and services, other
          than the services reported in Item 4(a)-(c) above, rendered to the
          registrant.

          Fees included in the all other fees category would consist of
          services related to internal control reviews, strategy and other
          consulting, financial information systems design and implementation,
          consulting on other information systems, and other tax services

          years indicated above.

      (e) (1)  Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures:
               ----------------------------------------------------
               The registrant's Audit Committee ("audit committee") has adopted
               an "Audit Committee Charter (Amended and Restated as of May 12,
               2004)" (the "charter"). The charter contains the audit
               committee's pre-approval policies and procedures. Reproduced
               below is an excerpt from the charter regarding pre-approval
               policies and procedures:

                    The [audit] Committee shall:

                    2.  Pre-approve (a) all audit and permissible non-audit
                        services(1) to be provided to the Fund and (b) all
                        permissible non-audit services to be provided by the
                        Fund's independent auditors to UBS Global [AM] and any
                        Covered Service Providers, if the engagement relates
                        directly to the operations and financial reporting of
                        the Fund. In carrying out this responsibility, the
                        Committee shall seek periodically from UBS Global [AM]
                        and from the independent auditors a list of such audit
                        and permissible non-audit services that can be expected
                        to be rendered to the Fund, UBS Global [AM] or any
                        Covered Service Providers by the Fund's independent
                        auditors, and an estimate of the fees sought to be paid
                        in connection with such services. The Committee may
                        delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such
                        audit and permissible non-audit services to a
                        sub-committee consisting of the Chairperson of the
                        Committee and two other members of the Committee as the
                        Chairperson, from time to time, may determine and
                        appoint, and such sub-committee shall
<PAGE>

                        report to the Committee, at its next regularly
                        scheduled meeting after the sub-committee's meeting,
                        its decision(s). From year to year, the Committee
                        shall report to the Board whether this system of
                        pre-approval has been effective and efficient or
                        whether this Charter should be amended to allow for
                        pre-approval pursuant to such policies and procedures
                        as the Committee shall approve, including the
                        delegation of some or all of the Committee's
                        pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other
                        than UBS Global [AM] or the Fund's officers).
                        _______________

                            (1) The Committee will not approve non-audit
                            services that the Committee believes may taint the
                            independence of the auditors. Currently,
                            permissible non-audit services include any
                            professional services (including tax services) that
                            are not prohibited services as described below,
                            provided to the Fund by the independent auditors,
                            other than those provided to the Fund in connection
                            with an audit or a review of the financial
                            statements of the Fund. Permissible non-audit
                            services may not include: (i) bookkeeping or other
                            services related to the accounting records or
                            financial statements of the Fund; (ii) financial
                            information systems design and implementation;
                            (iii) appraisal or valuation services, fairness
                            opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; (iv)
                            actuarial services; (v) internal audit outsourcing
                            services; (vi) management functions or human
                            resources; (vii) broker or dealer, investment
                            adviser or investment banking services; (viii)
                            legal services and expert services unrelated to the
                            audit; and (ix) any other service the Public
                            Company Accounting Oversight Board determines, by
                            regulation, is impermissible.

                            Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible
                            non-audit services is not required so long as: (i)
                            the aggregate amount of all such permissible
                            non-audit services provided to the Fund, UBS Global
                            [AM] and any service providers controlling,
                            controlled by or under common control with UBS
                            Global [AM] that provide ongoing services to the
                            Fund ("Covered Service Providers") constitutes not
                            more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid
                            to the independent auditors (during the fiscal year
                            in which the permissible non-audit services are
                            provided) by (a) the Fund, (b) its investment
                            adviser and (c) any entity controlling, controlled
                            by, or under common control with the investment
                            adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund
                            during the fiscal year in which the services are
                            provided that would have to be approved by the
                            Committee; (ii) the permissible non-audit services
                            were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the
                            engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such
                            services are promptly brought to the attention of
                            the Committee and approved by the Committee (or its
                            delegate(s)) prior to the completion of the audit.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.
- --------------------------------

The registrant's Board of Directors believes that the voting of proxies on
securities held by the registrant is an important element of the overall
investment process. As such, the Board has delegated the responsibility to vote
such proxies to the registrant's advisor. Following is a summary of the proxy
voting policy of the advisor.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY, VOTING GUIDELINES AND POLICY SUMMARY

The proxy voting policy of UBS Global AM is based on its belief that voting
rights have economic value and must be treated accordingly. Generally, UBS
Global AM expects the boards of directors of companies issuing securities held
by its clients to act as stewards of the financial assets of the company, to
exercise good judgment and practice diligent oversight with the management of
the company. While there is no absolute set of rules that determines
appropriate corporate governance under all circumstances and no set of rules
will guarantee ethical behavior, there are certain benchmarks, which, if
substantial progress is made toward, give evidence of good corporate governance.
UBS Global AM may delegate to an independent proxy voting and research service
the authority to exercise the voting rights associated with certain client
holdings. Any such delegation shall be made with the direction that the votes
be exercised in accordance with UBS Global AM's proxy voting policy.

When UBS Global AM's view of a company's management is favorable, UBS Global AM
generally supports current management initiatives. When UBS Global AM's view is
that changes to the management structure would probably increase shareholder
value, UBS Global AM may not support existing management proposals. In general,
UBS Global AM (1) opposes proposals which act to entrench management; (2)
believes that boards should be independent of company management and composed of
persons with requisite skills, knowledge and experience; (3) opposes structures
which impose financial constraints on changes in control; (4) believes
remuneration should be commensurate with responsibilities and performance; and
(5) believes that appropriate steps should be taken to ensure the independence
of auditors.

UBS Global AM has implemented procedures designed to identify whether it has a
conflict of interest in voting a particular proxy proposal, which may arise as a
result of its or its affiliates' client relationships,
<PAGE>

marketing efforts or banking and broker/dealer activities. To address such
conflicts, UBS Global AM has imposed information barriers between it and its
affiliates who conduct banking, investment banking and broker/dealer activities
and has implemented procedures to prevent business, sales and marketing issues
from influencing our proxy votes. Whenever UBS Global AM is aware of a conflict
with respect to a particular proxy, its appropriate local corporate governance
committee is required to review and agree to the manner in which such proxy is
voted.

         serves as investment advisor, sub-advisor or manager.

         Information is as of - March 31, 2006

     (a) (2) (i) Portfolio Manager

                 Kevin McIntyre

     (a) (2) (ii) (A)  Registered Management Investment Companies

                 The portfolio manager is responsible for 1 additional
         Registered Management Investment Company and manages $782,554,774 in
         total assets.

     (a) (2) (ii) (B)  Other Pooled Investment Vehicles

                  None

     (a) (2) (ii) (C)  Other Accounts

                  None

     (a) (2) (iii)  Accounts with respect to which an advisory fee is based on

     (a) (2) (iv) Conflicts.

             The management of the registrant and other accounts by a
         portfolio manager could result in potential conflicts of interest if
         the registrant and other accounts have different objectives,
         benchmarks and fees because the portfolio manager and his team must
         allocate time and investment expertise across multiple accounts,
         including the registrant. The portfolio manager and his team manage
         the registrant and other accounts utilizing an approach that groups
         similar accounts characteristics and objectives. The Advisor manages
         accounts according to their respective objectives, including where
         possible, those accounts that have specific investment restrictions.
         Accordingly, portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and
         sector exposures tend to be similar across accounts, which may
         minimize the potential for conflicts of interest.

             If a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity
         that may be suitable for more than one account, the registrant may not
         be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an allocation
         of filled purchase or sale orders across all eligible model portfolios
         and accounts. To deal with these situations, the Advisor has adopted
         procedures for allocating portfolio trades across multiple accounts to
         provide fair treatment to all accounts.

              The management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may
         also give rise to potential conflicts of interest. The Advisor and
         the registrant have adopted Codes of Ethics that govern such personal
         trading but there is no assurance that the Codes will adequately
         address all such conflicts.

     (a) (3) Compensation.

             The compensation received by portfolio managers at UBS Global
         AM - Americas Region, including Mr. McIntyre, includes a base salary
         and incentive compensation as detailed below. Overall compensation
         can be grouped into three categories: Base Salary, Annual bonuses and
         UBS AG Equity. Base salary is fixed compensation used to recognize
         the experience, skills and knowledge that the investment
         professionals bring to their roles. Annual bonuses are correlated
         with performance and are based on three components: 1) the firm's
         overall business success; 2) the performance of the respective asset
         class and/or investment mandate; and 3) an individual's specific
         contribution to the firm's results. Senior investment professionals
         may receive a portion of their annual performance-based incentive in
         the form of deferred or restricted UBS AG shares or employee stock
         options. Broader equity share ownership is encouraged for all
         employees through "Equity Plus." This long-term incentive program
         gives employees the opportunity to purchase UBS stock with after-tax
         funds from their bonus or salary. Two UBS stock options are given for
         each share acquired and held for two years.
