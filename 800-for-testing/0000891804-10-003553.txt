Chairman's
Letter to Shareholders

[PHOTO OF ROBERT P. BREMNER]

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

The economic environment in which your Fund operates reflects continuing but
uneven economic recovery. The U.S. and other major industrial countries are
experiencing steady but comparatively low levels of economic growth, while
emerging market countries are seeing a resumption of relatively strong economic
expansion. The potential impact of steps being considered by many governments to
counteract the extraordinary governmental spending and credit expansion to deal
with the recent financial and economic crisis is injecting uncertainty into
global financial markets. The implications for future tax rates, government
spending, interest rates and the pace of economic recovery in the U.S. and other
leading economies are extremely difficult to predict at the present time. The
long term health of the global economy depends on restoring some measure of
fiscal discipline around the world, but since all of the corrective steps
require economic pain, it is not surprising that governments are reluctant to
undertake them.

In the near term, governments remain committed to furthering economic recovery
and realizing a meaningful reduction in their national unemployment rates. Such
an environment should produce continued economic growth and, consequently,
attractive investment opportunities. Over the longer term, the larger
uncertainty mentioned earlier carries the risk of unexpected potholes in the
road to sustained recovery. For this reason, Nuveen's investment management
teams are working hard to balance return and risk by building well-diversified
portfolios, among other strategies. I encourage you to read the following
commentary on the management of your Fund. As always, I also encourage you to
contact your financial consultant if you have any questions about your Nuveen
Fund investment. Please consult the Nuveen web site for the most recent
information on your Nuveen Funds at: www.nuveen.com.

On behalf of the other members of your Fund's Board, we look forward to
continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

Portfolio manager Paul Brennan reviews key investment strategies and the
six-month performance of these six national Funds. With 20 years of industry
experience, including twelve years at Nuveen, Paul assumed portfolio management
responsibility for NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG and NEA in 2006.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2010?

Municipal market conditions began to show general signs of improvement
throughout most of the period. This trend was bolstered by the reduced issuance
of tax-exempt municipal debt, due in part to the introduction of the Build
America Bond program in April 2009. Build America Bonds are a new class of
taxable municipal debt created as part of the February 2009 economic stimulus
package. These bonds currently offer municipal issuers a federal subsidy equal
to 35% of the bonds' interest payments and therefore provide issuers with an
attractive alternative to traditional tax-exempt debt. For the six-month period
ended April 30, 2010, taxable Build America Bond issuance totaled $48.9 billion,
accounting for almost 24% of new bonds in the municipal market-place nationwide.

The tighter supply situation was compounded for these Funds by the severe
decline in issuance of AAA rated insured bonds. Over the six-month period, new
insured paper accounted for approximately 6% of national issuance, compared with
about 12% during the same period a year earlier and historical levels of
approximately 50%. In response to this situation, the Funds' Board of
Directors/Trustees approved changes to the Funds' investment policies that
increased their investment flexibility while retaining the insured nature of
their portfolios. These six Funds can now invest at least 80% of their net
assets in municipal securities that are covered by insurance from insurers with
a claims-paying ability rated at least BBB- at the time of purchase. In
addition, the Funds may invest up

to 20% of their net assets in uninsured investment-grade credits rated BBB- or
higher. The investment policy changes are discussed in more detail on page
seven.

Despite the constrained issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds, we continued to
find attractive value opportunities, taking a bottom-up approach to discovering
undervalued sectors and individual credits with the potential to perform
relatively well over the long term. Areas of the market where we found value
during this period included essential services bonds such as general obligation
(GO) and other tax-supported credits, transportation (specifically tollroads and
airports) and water and sewer. The impact of the Build America Bond program was
evident especially in the area of longer-term issuance, as municipal issuers
sought to take full advantage of the attractive financing terms offered by these
bonds. Approximately 70% of Build America Bonds were issued with maturities of
at least 30 years or more. Even though this significantly reduced the
availability of tax-exempt bonds with longer maturities, we continued to focus
on finding and purchasing attractive longer-term bonds for these Funds.

Cash for new purchases during this period was generated primarily by the
proceeds from bond redemptions and calls. In addition, we took advantage of
attractive sell opportunities to trim the Funds' holdings of pre-refunded bonds.

Shortly before the beginning of this reporting period, the Nuveen Insured
Florida Premium Income Municipal Fund (NFL) was reorganized into NIO, and the
Nuveen Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NWF) was reorganized
into NEA (the "Reorganizations"). In the Reorganizations, NIO and NEA acquired
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the two Florida funds in a
tax-free transaction in exchange for an equal aggregate value of newly-issued
common shares. In general, the securities acquired through the Reorganizations
matched the investment parameters and strategies of NIO and NEA and required
little immediate portfolio activity. As a result of the Reorganizations, NIO and
NEA's exposures to Florida bonds rose. During this period, we began reducing
these exposures to bring them more in line with our standard investment
parameters. We intend to continue reducing these exposures over time as
appropriate opportunities arise.

As of April 30, 2010, all six of these Funds continued to use inverse floating
rate securities. (1) We employ inverse floaters for a variety of reasons,
including leverage, duration management and both income and total return
enhancement.

(1) AN INVERSE FLOATING RATE SECURITY, ALSO KNOWN AS AN INVERSE FLOATER, IS A
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TO PAY LONG-TERM TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST AT A RATE
THAT VARIES INVERSELY WITH A SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST RATE INDEX. FOR THE
NUVEEN FUNDS, THE INDEX TYPICALLY USED IS THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL
MARKETS (SIFM) MUNICIPAL SWAP INDEX (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS THE BOND MARKET
ASSOCIATION INDEX OR BMA). INVERSE FLOATERS, INCLUDING THOSE INVERSE FLOATING
RATE SECURITIES IN WHICH THE FUNDS INVESTED DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD, ARE

</TABLE>

For the six months ended April 30, 2010, the cumulative returns on common share
net asset value (NAV) for all six of these Funds exceeded the return for the
Standard & Poor's (S&P) Insured Municipal Bond Index. For the same period, NQI
outperformed the return for the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds Average,
while NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG and NEA trailed the Lipper average.

Key management factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this period
included yield curve and duration positioning, credit exposure and sector
allocation. In addition, the use of leverage was an important factor affecting
the Funds' performance over this period. The impact of leverage is discussed in
more detail on page five.

During this period, bonds with longer maturities generally outperformed credits
with shorter maturities, with bonds at the longest end of the yield curve
posting the strongest returns. The outperformance of longer bonds was due in
part to the decline in interest rates, particularly at the longer end of the
curve. The scarcity of tax-exempt bonds with longer maturities also drove up
their prices. Overall, yield curve positioning and duration proved positive for
the performance of these Funds. NQI and NIO, which had the longest durations,
were relatively better positioned for the interest rate environment of the past
six months.

Credit exposure also played a role in performance of these Funds. The demand for
municipal bonds increased during the period, driven by a variety of factors,
including concerns about potential tax increases, the need to rebalance
portfolio allocations and a growing appetite for additional risk. At the same
time, the supply of issuance of new tax-exempt municipal securities declined. As
investors bid up municipal bond prices, bonds rated BBB or below generally
outperformed those rated AAA. While these six Funds remained heavily weighted in
insured and higher quality credits, their performance benefited from their
holdings of lower-rated credits.

(*)   Six-month returns are cumulative; returns for one-year, five-year, and
      ten-year are annualized.

      Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance
      may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns do not reflect the
      deduction of taxes that shareholders may have to pay on Fund distributions
      or upon the sale of Fund shares.

      your Fund in this report.

(2)   The Standard & Poor's (S&P) Insured Municipal Bond Index is an
      unleveraged, market value-weighted index designed to measure the
      performance of the insured U.S. municipal bond market. This index does not
      reflect any initial or ongoing expenses and is not available for direct
      investment.

(3)   The Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds Average is calculated using the
      returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period as
      follows: 6-month, 8 funds; 1-year, 8 funds; 5-year, 7 funds; and 10-year,
      7 funds. Lipper returns account for the effects of management fees and
      assume reinvestment of dividends, but do not reflect any applicable sales
      charges. The Lipper average is not available for direct investment.

Sectors that generally contributed to performance during this period included
industrial development revenue, health care and housing bonds. In particular,
the Funds had exposure to lower-rated health care credits that helped to enhance
their returns. Revenue bonds as a whole performed well, with transportation,
leasing and special tax among the sectors outperforming the general municipal
market for this period. Zero coupon bonds also were among the strongest
performers.

Pre-refunded bonds, which are often backed by U.S. Treasury securities,
performed relatively poorly during this period. The underperformance of these
bonds can be attributed primarily to their shorter effective maturities and
higher credit quality. As of April 30, 2010, NVG and NEA had the largest
exposures to pre-refunded bonds, while NQI and NPX had the smallest allocations.
On the whole, general obligation (GO) bonds lagged the overall municipal market
by a small margin, while water and sewer, education, electric utilities and
resource recovery bonds trailed the other revenue sectors for the six months.

IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

One important factor impacting the returns of most of these Funds relative to
the comparative index was the Funds' use of financial leverage. The Funds use
leverage because their managers believe that, over time, leveraging provides
opportunities for additional income and total return for common shareholders.
However, use of leverage also can expose common shareholders to additional
volatility. For example, as the prices of securities held by a Fund decline, the
negative impact of these valuation changes on common share net asset value and
common shareholder total return is magnified by the use of leverage. Conversely,
leverage may enhance common share returns during periods when bond prices
generally are rising.

Leverage made a positive contribution to the performance of these Funds over
this reporting period.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE FUNDS' LEVERAGED CAPITAL STRUCTURE

Shortly after their inceptions, each of the Funds issued auction rate preferred
shares (ARPS) to create financial leverage. As noted in past shareholder
reports, the ARPS issued by many closed-end funds, including these Funds, have
been hampered by a lack of liquidity since February 2008. Since that time, more
ARPS have been submitted for sale in each of their regularly scheduled auctions
than there have been offers to buy. In fact, offers to buy have been almost
completely non-existent since late February 2008. This means that these auctions
have "failed to clear," and that many, or all, of the ARPS shareholders who
wanted to sell their shares in these auctions were unable to do so. This lack of
liquidity in ARPS did not lower the credit quality of these shares, and ARPS

                                                            Nuveen Investments 5

<PAGE>

shareholders unable to sell their shares continued to receive distributions at
the "maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions, as calculated in accordance
with the pre-established terms of the ARPS. In the recent market, with
short-term rates at multi-generational lows, those maximum rates also have been
low.

One continuing implication for common shareholders from the auction failures is
that each Fund's cost of leverage likely has been incrementally higher at times
than it otherwise might have been had the auctions continued to be successful.
As a result, each Fund's common share earnings likely have been incrementally
lower at times than they otherwise might have been.

As noted in past shareholder reports, the Nuveen funds' Board of
Directors/Trustees authorized several methods to refinance a portion of the
Nuveen funds' outstanding ARPS. Some funds have utilized tender option bonds
(TOBs), also known as floating rate securities, for leverage purposes. The
amount of TOBs that a fund may use varies according to the composition of each
fund's portfolio. Some funds have a greater ability to use TOBs than others.
Some funds have issued Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares (VRDP), but these
issuances have been limited since it has been difficult to find liquidity
providers on economically viable terms given the constrained credit environment.
Some funds have issued MuniFund Term Preferred Shares (MTP), a fixed rate form
of preferred stock with a mandatory redemption period of five years.

While all these efforts have reduced the total amount of outstanding ARPS issued
by the Nuveen funds, the Funds cannot provide any assurance on when the
remaining outstanding ARPS might be redeemed.

On April 9, 2010, twenty-six Nuveen leveraged closed-end funds, including NQI,
NVG, NEA and NIF, received a demand letter from a law firm on behalf of each
fund's common shareholders, alleging that Nuveen and the fund's officers and
Board of Directors/Trustees breached their fiduciary duties related to the
redemption at par of the fund's ARPS. The funds' independent Board is evaluating
the demand letter for each fund.

As of April 30, 2010, the amounts of ARPS redeemed at par by the following Funds
are as shown in the accompanying table.

As of April 30, 2010, NVG and NEA had issued and outstanding $108 million and
$83 million of MTP, respectively, and NPX had issued and outstanding $219
million VRDP. (Refer to Notes to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - General
Information and Significant Accounting Policies and Footnote 4 - Fund Shares for
further details on MTP and VRDP.)

As of April 30, 2010, 83 out of the 84 Nuveen closed-end municipal funds that
had issued ARPS have redeemed at par all or a portion of these shares. These
redemptions bring the total amount of Nuveen's municipal closed-end funds' ARPS
redemptions to approximately $4.4 billion of the approximately $11.0 billion
originally outstanding.

RECENT CHANGES TO INVESTMENT POLICIES OF NUVEEN INSURED FUNDS

As a result of the "credit crunch" that began in 2007 and that led to the
financial crisis that peaked in late 2008, the financial strength ratings
assigned to most municipal bond insurers have been downgraded by the primary
ratings agencies. These ratings downgrades generally have reduced, and any
additional ratings downgrades may further reduce, the effective rating of many
of the bonds insured by those bond insurers, including bonds held by the Funds.
This in turn has sharply reduced, and in some cases may have eliminated, the
value provided by such insurance. Nonetheless, the Fund's holdings continue to
be well diversified and on the whole, the underlying credit quality of its
holdings are of medium to high quality. It is also important to note that
municipal bonds historically have had a very low rate of default.

On May 3, 2010, after the close of this reporting period, the Funds' Board of
Directors/Trustees approved changes to each Fund's investment policies. The
Board of Directors/Trustees took this action in response to the continuing
challenges faced by municipal bond insurers. The changes to each Fund's
investment policies are intended to increase the Funds' investment flexibility
in pursuing their investment objective, while retaining the insured nature of
its portfolio.

The changes, effective immediately, provide that under normal circumstances, the
Funds invest at least 80% of their managed assets (as defined in Footnote 7 -
Management Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates) in municipal securities
that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and
interest. In addition, the municipal securities in which each Fund invests will
be rated investment grade at the time of purchase (based on the higher of the
rating of the insurer, if any, or the underlying security) by at least one
independent rating agency, or are unrated but judged to be of similar credit
quality by Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), or are backed by an escrow
or trust account containing sufficient U.S. government or U.S. government agency
securities or U.S. Treasury-issued State and Local Government Series securities
to ensure timely payment of principal and interest. Inverse floating rate
securities whose underlying bonds are covered by insurance are included for
purposes of the 80%.

Common Share Dividend and Share Price Information

During the six-month reporting period ended April 30, 2010, NIO and NIF each had
two monthly dividend increases and NQI, NPX and NEA each had one monthly
dividend increase. The dividend of NVG remained stable throughout the reporting
period.

Due to normal portfolio activity, common shareholders of NVG received a
long-term capital gains distribution of $0.0409 per share at the end of December
2009.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2010, all six of
the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances, based upon our best
estimate, for tax purposes and positive UNII balances for financial reporting
purposes.

(1)   The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 94% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(3)   MBIA's public finance subsidiary.

(4)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

(1)   The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 96% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(3)   MBIA's public finance subsidiary.

(4)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 88% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an

(1)   The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 97% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(3)   MBIA's public finance subsidiary.

(4)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

(1)   The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 92% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an

      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

      of $0.0409 per share.

      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

(1)   The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information. As of April 30, 2010, the
      Fund includes 88% (as a % of total investments) of Insured securities.

(2)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(3)   MBIA's public finance subsidiary.

(4)   Ratings shown are the highest rating given by one or more national rating
      agencies. AAA includes bonds with an implied AAA rating since they are
      backed by U.S. Government or agency securities. AAA, AA, A and BBB are
      investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade
      ratings. Holdings designated N/R are not rated by a national rating
      agency.

      The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   The Fund's Adviser has concluded this issue is not likely to meet its
      future interest payment obligations and has directed the Fund's custodian
      to cease accruing additional income on the Fund's records.

(6)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(7)   Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 29.5%.

N/R   Not rated.

WI/DD Purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction. See Notes to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Inverse
      Floating Rate Securities for more information.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

      The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
      securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
      of principal and debt service thereon. See Notes to Financial Statements,
      Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   The Fund's Adviser has concluded this issue is not likely to meet its
      future interest payment obligations and has directed the Fund's custodian
      to cease accruing additional income on the Fund's records.

(6)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(7)   Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 29.9%.

N/R   Not rated.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

      transaction. See Notes to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Inverse
      Floating Rate Securities for more information.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc. (NQI), Nuveen
Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 (NPX),
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG) and Nuveen Insured
Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA) (collectively, the "Funds"). Common
shares of Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured
Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) are traded on the NYSE Amex. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
management investment companies.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, the following Nuveen Florida
closed-end municipal funds were reorganized into the following existing Nuveen
national municipal closed-end funds, as follows (collectively, the
"Reorganizations"):

      o     Nuveen Insured Florida Premium Income Municipal Fund (NFL) into
            Insured Opportunity (NIO);

      o     Nuveen Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NWF) into
            Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA).

Each of these Funds called a special meeting of shareholders, originally
scheduled in each case for May 15, 2009, to vote on the Reorganizations. Those
meetings were subsequently adjourned to and reconvened in June and July, at
which time, shareholders of each of Insured Florida Premium Income (NFL),
Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF), Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) approved its respective Reorganization, with more than
80% of participating shares of each fund voting in favor of the Reorganization.

After the close of business on October 16, 2009, Insured Opportunity (NIO) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) acquired all the net assets of Insured Florida
Premium Income (NFL) and Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF), respectively,
pursuant to the plan of Reorganizations described above. The acquisition was
accomplished by a tax-free exchange of Insured Florida Premium Income (NFL) and
Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF) Common shares for Insured Opportunity
(NIO) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) Common shares, respectively. On
October 16, 2009, the net assets of Insured Florida Premium Income (NFL) and
Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF) were $207,492,882 and $54,285,213,
respectively. Insured Florida Premium Income's (NFL) and Insured Florida
Tax-Free Advantage's (NWF) net assets applicable to Common shares at that date
included $8,234,921 and $3,171,992 of net unrealized appreciation, respectively.
Each Fund's net unrealized appreciation was combined with that of Insured
Opportunity (NIO) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA), respectively. The
combined net assets applicable to Common shares of Insured Opportunity (NIO) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) immediately after the acquisitions were
$1,372,440,081 and $323,751,223, respectively. For accounting and performance
reporting purposes, Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage
(NEA) are the survivors. Prior to the Reorganizations, each of Insured Florida
Premium Income (NFL) and Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF) established a
reserve for certain costs and expenses associated with the Reorganizations,
including amounts estimated for the advancement of legal costs in connection
with legal proceedings brought by a shareholder of the funds challenging the
Reorganizations. The amount of such reserve is included as a component of
Insured Opportunity's (NIO) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage's (NEA) "Accrued
other expenses" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a portfolio of
municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with US
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").

Investment Valuation

Exchange-listed securities are generally valued at the last sales price on the
security exchange on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on a securities exchange for which there are no transactions on a given
day or securities not listed on a securities exchange are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices. Securities traded on NASDAQ are valued at the
NASDAQ Official Closing Price. The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's
investment portfolio are provided by a pricing service approved by the Fund's
Board of Directors/Trustees. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided
by an independent pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of
Directors/Trustees. When market price quotes are not readily available (which is
usually the case for municipal securities), the pricing service or, in the
absence of a pricing service for a particular investment or derivative
instrument, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Fund, or its designee, may
establish fair value using a wide variety of market data including yields or
prices of investments of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon, maturity and
rating, market quotes or indications of value from security dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral, general market conditions and other
information and analysis, including the obligor's credit characteristics
considered relevant. Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand features qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates value.

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2010, Insured
Quality (NQI) had outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments
of $1,052,700. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the
other Funds.

Investment Income

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income, which
includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for financial
reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis. Investment income also
includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from municipal
securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, and in the case of
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax applicable to
individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders
of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid
by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions, management of the
Funds has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that
would require recognition in the financial statements. Open tax years are those
that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the last
four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). Furthermore,
management of the Funds is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. GAAP.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares

The following Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred Shares
("ARPS"), $25,000 stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial
leverage. Each Fund's ARPS are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate
paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a
dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end
of each rate period. As of April 30, 2010, the number of ARPS outstanding, by

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the ARPS issued by the Funds than there were offers to
buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear,'' and that many ARPS
shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in these auctions were unable to do
so. ARPS shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the
"maximum rate'' applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with
the pre-established terms of the ARPS. As of April 30, 2010, the aggregate
amount of outstanding ARPS redeemed by each Fund is as follows:

Each Fund is obligated to redeem its MTP Shares by the date as specified in its
offering document ("Term Redemption"), unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by
the Fund. MTP Shares are subject to optional and mandatory redemption in certain
circumstances. MTP Shares will be subject to redemption at the option of each
Fund ("Optional Redemption Date"), subject to a payment of premium for one year
following the Optional Redemption Date ("Premium Expiration Date"), and at par
thereafter. MTP Shares also will be subject to redemption, at the option of each
Fund, at par in the event of certain changes in the credit rating of the MTP
Shares. Each Fund may be obligated to redeem certain of the MTP Shares if the
Fund fails to maintain certain asset coverage and leverage ratio requirements
and such failures are not cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption
price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends. The Term Redemption, Optional Redemption Date
and Premium Expiration Date for each Fund's MTP Shares are as follows:

Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares

Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) has issued and outstanding 2,190 Series 1
Variable Rate Demand Preferred ("VRDP") Shares, $100,000 liquidation value per
share. The Fund issued its VRDP Shares in a privately negotiated offering in
August 2008. Proceeds of the Fund's offering were used to redeem a portion of
the Fund's outstanding ARPS. The VRDP Shares were offered to institutional
buyers as defined pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 and
have a maturity date of August 1, 2038.

VRDP Shares include a liquidity feature that allows VRDP shareholders to have
their shares purchased by a liquidity provider with whom the Fund has contracted
in the event that purchase orders for VRDP Shares in a remarketing are not
sufficient in number to be matched with the sale orders in that remarketing. The
terms of the Fund's VRDP Shares presently do not provide the liquidity provider
with the right to cause the Fund to redeem VRDP Shares after six months of
continuous, unsuccessful remarketing. The Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has
approved, in connection with renewing its liquidity provider contract in June
2010, the issuance of replacement VRDP Shares that would provide the liquidity
provider with a right of redemption after six months of continuous unsuccessful
remarketing.

Dividends on the VRDP Shares (which are treated as interest payments for
financial reporting purposes) are set weekly at a rate established by a
remarketing agent; therefore, the market value of the VRDP Shares is expected to
approximate its liquidation value. If remarketings for VRDP Shares are

| Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

continuously unsuccessful for six months, the maximum rate is designed to
escalate according to a specified schedule in order to enhance the remarketing
agent's ability to successfully remarket the VRDP Shares.

Subject to certain conditions, VRDP Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part,
at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund may also redeem certain of the
VRDP Shares if the Fund fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements
and such failures are not cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption
price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) had all $219,000,000 of its VRDP Shares
outstanding during the six months ended April 30, 2010, with an annualized
interest rate of 0.31%.

For financial reporting purposes only, the liquidation value of VRDP Shares is
recognized as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Unpaid
dividends on VRDP Shares are recognized as a component of "Interest payable" on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Dividends paid on the VRDP Shares are
recognized as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations. In addition to this interest expense, the
Funds also pay a per annum liquidity fee to the liquidity provider, which is
recognized as "Liquidity fees" on the Statement of Operations.

Insurance

Under normal circumstances and during the six months ended April 30, 2010, each
Fund invests at least 80% of their net assets, (as defined in Footnote 7 -
Management Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates) in municipal securities
that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and
interest. For purposes of this 80%, insurers must have a claims paying ability
rated at least "A" at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating
agency. In addition, each Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in
municipal securities that are rated at least "BBB" at the time of purchase
(based on the higher of the rating of the insurer, if any, or the underlying
security) by at least one independent rating agency, or are unrated but judged
to be of similar credit quality by Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuveen, or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities or
U.S. Treasury-issued State and Local Government Series securities to ensure
timely payment of principal and interest. Inverse floating rate securities whose
underlying bonds are covered by insurance are included for purposes of the 80%.
Each Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in municipal securities
rated at least "BBB" (based on the higher rating of the insurer, if any, or the
underlying bond) or are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the
Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

 Inverse Floating Rate Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as "(IF) - Inverse floating rate investment." An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction. In
such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as "(UB) - Underlying bond of an

inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing transaction," with the Fund
accounting for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as
"Floating rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In
addition, the Fund reflects in "Investment Income" the entire earnings of the
underlying bond and recognizes the related interest paid to the holders of the
short-term floating rate certificates as a component of "Interest expense and
amortization of offering costs" on the Statement of Operations.

During the six months ended April 30, 2010, each Fund invested in
externally-deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is recognized as
"Unrealized depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

At April 30, 2010, each Fund's maximum exposure to externally-deposited Recourse
Trusts, is as follows:

Forward Swap Contracts

Each Fund is authorized to enter into forward interest rate swap contracts
consistent with their investment objectives and policies to reduce, increase or
otherwise alter its risk profile or to alter its portfolio characteristics (i.e.
duration, yield curve positioning and credit quality).

Each Fund is subject to interest rate risk in the normal course of pursuing its
investment objectives. Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap
transactions is intended to help the Fund manage its overall interest rate
sensitivity, either shorter or longer, generally to more closely align the
Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that of the broader municipal market.
Forward interest rate swap transactions involve each Fund's agreement with a
counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or variable rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable or fixed rate payment, the
accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the future (the "effective
date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional amount of
the swap contract and the termination date of the swap (which is akin to a
bond's maturity). The value of the Fund's swap commitment would increase or
decrease based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swap's termination date increases or decreases.
Forward interest rate swap contracts are valued daily. The net amount recorded
on these transactions for each counterparty is recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities as "Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on forward
swaps" with the change during the fiscal period recognized on the Statement of
Operations as "Change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of forward
swaps."

The Funds may terminate a swap contract prior to the effective date, at which
point a realized gain or loss is recognized. When a forward swap is terminated,
it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying
assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis. Net realized
gains and losses during the fiscal period are recognized on the Statement of
Operations as "Net realized gain (loss) from forward swaps." Each Fund intends,
but is not obligated, to terminate its forward swaps before the effective date.
Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such
transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with a counterparty
failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon
termination. The Funds did not invest in forward interest rate swap transactions
during the six months ended April 30, 2010.

| Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

Market and Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business each Fund may invest in financial instruments
and enter into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to
changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to the
transaction to perform (counterparty credit risk). The potential loss could
exceed the value of the financial assets recorded on the financial statements.
Financial assets, which potentially expose each Fund to counterparty credit
risk, consist principally of cash due from counterparties on forward, option and
swap transactions, when applicable. The extent of each Fund's exposure to
counterparty credit risk in respect to these financial assets approximates their
carrying value as recorded on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Futures
contracts, when applicable, expose a Fund to minimal counterparty credit risk as
they are exchange traded and the exchange's clearinghouse, which is counterparty
to all exchange traded futures, guarantees the futures contracts against
default.

Each Fund helps manage counterparty credit risk by entering into agreements only
with counterparties the Adviser believes have the financial resources to honor
their obligations and by having the Adviser monitor the financial stability of
the counterparties. Additionally, counterparties may be required to pledge
collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of the financial asset) on behalf
of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized
gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when each Fund has an
unrealized loss, the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the
Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the
unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are
monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the valuations fluctuate, either
up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

Zero Coupon Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. The market prices of zero coupon securities generally are more
volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.

Offering Costs

Costs incurred by Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) in connection with its offering
of VRDP Shares ($2,535,000) were recorded as a deferred charge which will be
amortized over the 30-year life of the shares. Costs incurred by Insured
Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) in connection with
their offerings of MTP Shares ($1,875,000 and $1,605,000, respectively) were
recorded as a deferred charge which will be amortized over the 5-year life of
the shares. Each Fund's amortized deferred charges are recognized as a component
of "Interest expense and amortization of offering costs" on the Statement of
Operations.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their officers and directors/trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of increases and decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares
from operations during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In determining the value of each Fund's investments, various inputs are used.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:

      Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

      Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
                similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
                risk, etc.).

      Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including management's
                assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities. The following is a
summary of each Fund's fair value measurements as of April 30, 2010:

3. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Funds record derivative instruments at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognized on the Statement of Operations, when applicable. Even though
the Funds' investments in derivatives may represent economic hedges, they are
not considered to be hedge transactions for financial reporting purposes. The
Funds did not invest in derivative instruments during the six months ended April
30, 2010.

6. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
securities reflected as financing transactions, if any. To the extent that
differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented
in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences
do not impact the net asset values of the Funds.

At April 30, 2010, the cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
investments as determined on a federal income tax basis, were as follows:

7. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a fund-level fee,
based only on the amount of assets within each individual Fund, and a
complex-level fee, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by
the Adviser. This pricing structure enables each Fund's shareholders to benefit
from growth in the assets within their respective Fund as well as from growth in
the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee for each Fund, payable monthly, is calculated
according to the following schedule:

                                                           INSURED QUALITY (NQI)

*     The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate daily managed assets of all Nuveen
      funds, with such daily managed assets defined separately for each fund in
      its management agreement, but excluding assets attributable to investments
      in other Nuveen funds. For the complex-level and fund-level fees, daily
      managed assets include assets managed by the Adviser that are attributable
      to financial leverage. For these purposes, financial leverage includes the
      funds' use of preferred stock and borrowings and investments in the
      residual interest certificates (also called inverse floating rate
      securities) in tender option bond (TOB) trusts, including the portion of
      assets held by a TOB trust that has been effectively financed by the
      trust's issuance of floating rate securities, subject to an agreement by
      the Adviser to limit the amount of such assets for determining managed
      assets in certain circumstances. As of April 30, 2010, the complex-level
      fee rate was .1852%.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its directors/trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
directors/trustees that enables directors/trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets, for fees and expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth

8. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets During June 2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued changes to the authoritative guidance
under U.S. GAAP on accounting for transfers of financial assets. The objective
of this guidance is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its
financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a
transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a
transferor's continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets.

This guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first
annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods
within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting
periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. The recognition and
measurement provisions of this guidance must be applied to transfers occurring
on or after the effective date. Additionally, the disclosure provisions of this
guidance should be applied to transfers that occurred both before and after the
effective date of this guidance. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of this guidance and the impact it will have on the financial
statement amounts and disclosures, if any.

Fair Value Measurements

On January 21, 2010, FASB issued changes to the authoritative guidance under
U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements. The objective of this guidance is to
provide guidance on how investment assets and liabilities are to be valued and
disclosed. Specifically, the amendment requires reporting entities to disclose
i) the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both
recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, for both Level 2 and Level 3
positions, ii) transfers between all levels (including Level 1 and Level 2) on a
gross basis (i.e., transfers out must be disclosed separately from transfers in)
as well as the reason(s) for the transfer and iii) purchases, sales, issuances
and settlements in the Level 3 rollforward must be shown on a gross basis rather
than as one net number. The effective date of the amendment is for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, however, the requirement to
provide the Level 3 activity for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on
a gross basis will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2010. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of
this guidance and the impact it will have to the financial statement amounts and
footnote disclosures, if any.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Investment Policy Changes - Insurance

On May 3, 2010, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved changes to each
Fund's insurance investment policies in response to the continuing challenges
faced by municipal bond insurers. The changes to each Fund's investment policies
are intended to increase the Fund's investment flexibility in pursuing its
investment objective, while retaining the insured nature of its portfolio.

The changes, effective immediately, provide that under normal circumstances, the
Funds invest at least 80% of their managed assets (as defined in Footnote 7 -
Management Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates) in municipal securities
that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and
interest. In addition, the municipal securities in which each Fund invests will
be rated investment grade at the time of purchase (based on the higher of the
rating of the insurer, if any, or the underlying security) by at least one
independent rating agency, or are unrated but judged to be of similar credit
quality by the Adviser, or are backed by an escrow or trust account containing
sufficient U.S. government or U.S. government agency securities or U.S.
Treasury-issued State and Local Government Series securities to ensure timely
payment of principal and interest. Inverse floating rate securities whose
underlying bonds are covered by insurance are included for purposes of the 80%.

*     Annualized.

**    Rounds to less than $.01 per share.

***   During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
      Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser or $27,762
      and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
      investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment
      restrictions.  This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Fund's
      Total Return on Common Share Net Asset Value.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the
      following month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price.
      The actual reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may
      take place over several days, and in some instances may not be based on
      the market price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from
      the price used in the calculation.  Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at
      net asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset
      value, if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is
      typically paid on the first business day of the following month, is
      assumed to be reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual
      reinvest price for the last dividend declared in the period may often be
      based on the Fund's market price (and not its net asset value), and
      therefore may be different from the price used in the calculation. Total
      returns are not annualized.

(b)   Expense ratios do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits
      earned on the Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where
      applicable.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, the interest expense
      deemed to have been paid by the Fund on the floating rate certificates
      issued by the special purpose trusts for the self-deposited inverse
      floaters held by the Fund, as described in Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating
      Rate Securities.

(d)   For the six months ended April 30, 2010.

                                See accompanying notes to financial statements.

*     Annualized.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares and/or Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation.  Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

(b)   Expense ratios do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits
      earned on the Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where
      applicable.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, payments to Variable Rate
      Demand Preferred shareholders and/or the interest expense deemed to have
      been paid by the Fund on the floating rate certificates issued by the
      special purpose trusts for the self-deposited inverse floaters held by the
      Fund, where applicable, as described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

(d)   For the six months ended April 30, 2010.

                                See accompanying notes to financial statements.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares and/or MuniFund Term Preferred shares, were applicable.

(a)   Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation.  Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

(b)   After expense reimbursement from Adviser, where applicable. Expense ratios
      do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the
      Fund's net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable.

(c)   The expense ratios reflect, among other things, payments to MuniFund Term
      Preferred shareholders and/or the interest expense deemed to have been
      paid by the Fund on the floating rate certificates issued by the special
      purpose trusts for the self-deposited inverse floaters held by the Fund,
      where applicable, as described in Footnote 1 - MuniFund Term Preferred
      Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

Reinvest Automatically Easily and Conveniently

Nuveen makes reinvesting easy. A phone call is all it takes to set up your
reinvestment account.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price

102   Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of Terms Used in this Report

o     AUCTION RATE BOND: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities, also known as inverse
      floaters, are created by depositing a municipal bond, typically with a
      fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
      broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a) issues floating rate certificates
      typically paying short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties in
      amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or
      market value, and (b) issues an inverse floating rate certificate
      (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") to an investor (such as a
      Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure to a long-term municipal
      bond. The income received by the holder of the inverse floater varies
      inversely with the short-term rate paid to the floating rate certificates'
      holders, and in most circumstances the holder of the inverse floater bears
      substantially all of the underlying bond's downside investment risk. The
      holder of the inverse floater typically also benefits disproportionately
      from any potential appreciation of the underlying bond's value. Hence, an
      inverse floater essentially represents an investment in the underlying
      bond on a leveraged basis.

o     LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's NAV per share is calculated by subtracting
      the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares issued in
      order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing the
      remainder by the number of common shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are
      calculated at the end of each business day.

o     PRE-REFUNDING: Pre-refunding, also known as advanced refundings or
      refinancings, is a procedure used by state and local governments to
      refinance municipal bonds to lower interest expenses. The issuer sells new
      bonds with a lower yield and uses the proceeds to buy U.S. Treasury
      securities, the interest from which is used to make payments on the
      higher-yielding bonds. Because of this collateral, pre-refunding generally
      raises a bond's credit rating and thus its value.

o     TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.
