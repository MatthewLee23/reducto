             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") at March 31, 2006, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, and the
changes in its members' capital and the financial highlights for the year then
ended and for the period August 1, 2004 (commencement of operations) through
March 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments at March 31, 2006 with the investment funds, provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability  company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware  and
is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  as a
closed-end,   non-diversified,   management   investment  company.   The  Fund's
investment  objective is to generate  consistent  capital  appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets  primarily  among  professionally  selected  investment
funds  ("Investment   Funds")  that  are  managed  by  experienced   third-party
investment  advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ("J.P. Morgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation
of assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board
of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited  liability
company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),
serves as the managing  member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as
a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The Special  Member is  entitled  to all  performance-based
incentive allocations, if any from Members' accounts.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager as of the last business day of each month in accordance with
the valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to
time pursuant to policies  established by the Board.  The Fund's  investments in
the  Investment  Funds are  considered  to be illiquid  and can only be redeemed
periodically.  The  Board has  approved  procedures  pursuant  to which the Fund
values its  investments in Investment  Funds at fair value.  In accordance  with
these  procedures,  fair  value as of each  month-end  ordinarily  is the  value
determined as of such month-end for each  Investment Fund in accordance with the
Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies  and  reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2006 (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

the Fund could  reasonably  expect to  receive  from an  Investment  Fund if the
Fund's interest were redeemed at the time of the valuation, based on information
reasonably  available  at the  time  the  valuation  is made  and  that the Fund
believes to be reliable.  In the unlikely event that an Investment Fund does not
report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis, the Fund would determine
the fair value of such  Investment  Fund based on the most recent value reported
by the Investment Fund, as well any other relevant information  available at the
time the Fund values its portfolio. The values assigned to these investments are
based on available  information  and do not necessarily  represent  amounts that
might ultimately be realized, as such amounts depend on future circumstances and
cannot  reasonably be determined  until the individual  investments are actually
liquidated.  However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty of valuation,  those
estimated values may differ  significantly  from the values that would have been
used had a ready market for the investments  existed,  and the differences could
be significant.

C.   DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital.  Once the  investment's  cost is  received,  any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund.

E.   FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the  payment of
Federal,  state  or local  income  taxes  has  been  provided.  Each  Member  is
individually  required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

G.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies on deposit at PNC Bank, N.A.

H.   INITIAL OFFERING COSTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

The  Fund  incurred  initial  offering  costs  totaling  approximately  $377,167
comprised principally of legal costs pertaining to the preparation of the Fund's
offering  documents.  These costs were amortized over a twelve-month period from
the   commencement  of  operations.   Costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the
organization of the Fund were expensed at the commencement of operations.

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized  basis) and an additional
administrative  services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis)
of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed 2.30%  (comprising  the 1.5%  Management  Fee,  the 0.15%  Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee  and not  more  than a  further  0.65%  for  other
operating  expenses) on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate  operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense  limitations.  For
the year ended March 31, 2006 the Fund reimbursed the Investment Manager $66,658
for expenses the Investment Manager paid on the Fund's behalf.

The Investment  Manager  voluntarily  waived fees of $103,125 for the year ended
March 31, 2006. The fee waiver is not part of the Expense Limitation Agreement.

The Fund has entered into an administration  agreement with PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC"),
whereby PFPC provides fund  accounting,  investor  services and transfer  agency
functions for the Fund. As  compensation  for services set forth herein that are
rendered by PFPC during the term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PFPC an annual
fee  ranging  from 0.035% to 0.075% of the Fund's  average  net  assets,  with a
minimum monthly fee of $6,250 for administration  and accounting,  an annual fee
of 0.015% of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $3,334
for regulatory administration services, and an annual fee for Member services of
$150 per Member, with a minimum monthly fee of $1,000. PFPC waived $3,750 of its
fees for the year ended

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

March 31,  2006.  Any fees waived by PFPC are  recoverable  from the Fund if the
agreement with PFPC is terminated  within the first three years of the effective
date of the agreement.

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

PFPC Trust Company serves as custodian of the Fund's assets and provides
custodial services to the Fund.

4.   LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time,  the Fund may borrow  cash from a major  institution  under a
credit  agreement  up to a maximum  of $5  million.  Interest  is payable on any
outstanding  balance at PRIME plus  Margin  (0%) or LIBOR plus  Margin  (0.85%).
During the year ended March 31, 2006,  interest  expense on such  borrowings was
$3,868, of which none was payable as of March 31, 2006. The average  outstanding
loan payable  balance for the 29 days  outstanding  during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2006 was $700,000.  The average  interest paid on such  borrowings was
5.24%.

5.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate  purchases and sales of Investment  Funds for the year ended March 31,
2006 amounted to $59,569,234 and $39,668,762, respectively.

At March 31, 2006,  the estimated  cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax
purposes  was  substantially  the  same  as the  cost  for  financial  reporting
purposes.   Accordingly,   gross  unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  was
$28,447,638 and gross  unrealized  depreciation on investments was  $12,050,901,
resulting in net unrealized appreciation on investments of $16,396,737.

6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date, the Fund intends to
accept subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September,  and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the
day

6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

immediately  preceding the one-year  anniversary  of a Member's  purchase of its
Interests.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006,  there were no repurchases
subject to a repurchase fee.`

At the end of  each  Allocation  Period,  any net  capital  appreciation  or net
capital depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized), as the case may
be, is allocated to the capital  accounts of all of the Members  (including  the
Special  Member and the  Managing  Member)  in  proportion  to their  respective
opening  capital  account  balances  for such  Allocation  Period.  The  initial
"Allocation  Period"  began on the Initial  Closing Date,  with each  subsequent
Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close  of the  preceding
Allocation  Period.  Each Allocation  Period closes on the first to occur of (1)
the last day of each month, (2) the date immediately prior to the effective date
of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an increase in a Member's  capital
contribution,  (3) the effective date of any repurchase of Interests, or (4) the
date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year, a Member's  return on its  investment for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital  account  during the year,  net of such Member's pro rata
share of the  Management  Fee,  is  reallocated  to the  capital  account of the
Special Member in the following manner: (1) net capital  appreciation up to a 6%
return  remains  allocated  to such Member  (the  "Preferred  Return");  (2) net
capital  appreciation  in excess of the Preferred  Return is  reallocated to the
Special  Member  until  it has been  allocated  the next  0.30% of  return  (the
"Catch-Up");  and (3) thereafter,  95% of any net capital appreciation in excess
of the Preferred Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member,  and
the remaining 5% of such net capital  appreciation is reallocated to the Special
Member.  The amounts  reallocated  to the Special Member under (2) and (3) above
are referred to as the "Incentive  Allocation." No Incentive Allocation is made,
however,  with respect to a Member's  capital  account until any  cumulative net
capital depreciation  previously allocated to such Member's capital account plus
any  Management  Fees and Manager  Administrative  Service  Fees charged to such
capital  account  (the  "Loss  Carryforward")  have  been  recovered.  Any  Loss
Carryforward of a Member is reduced proportionately to reflect the repurchase of
any portion of that Member's  Interest.  Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other
than at the end of a calendar year) from a Member, a Performance Allocation will
be  determined  and  allocated  to the  Special  Member,  and in the case of any
repurchase of a partial  Interest,  on a "first in - first out" basis (i.e., the
portion of the Interest being  repurchased (and the amount with respect to which
the Incentive  Allocation is calculated)  will be deemed to have been taken from
the first capital  contribution  of such Member (as such  contribution  has been
adjusted for net capital appreciation or depreciation,  Management Fees, Manager
Administrative  Services Fees and other  expenses) until it is decreased to zero
and from each  subsequent  capital  contribution  until  such  contribution  (as
adjusted) is decreased to zero).

At December 31, 2005,  $356,785 was  reallocated  to the capital  account of the
Special Member.  An additional  $8,000 was reallocated to the capital account of
the Special Member on March 31, 2006 resulting from Members tendering  interests
for  repurchase as of such date.  Based upon profits for the period from January
1, 2006 to March 31, 2006, the  additional  Incentive  Allocation  that would be
reallocated to the Special Member is $189,530.  This amount is subject to change
as Incentive Allocations occur at the end of each calendar year.

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these
investments reported by the Fund.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment  Funds invest in actively  traded  securities and other
financial  instruments  using  different  strategies and investment  techniques,
including  leverage,  that may  involve  significant  risks.  Although  the Fund
attempts to  diversify  its risk by  investing in  Investment  Funds  managed by
different   third  party   managers,   the  Investment   Funds  may  nonetheless
independently  invest a high  percentage  of their assets in the same or similar
specific  sectors  of the  market  in order to  achieve  a  potentially  greater
investment  return. As a result, the Investment Funds may be more susceptible to
economic,  political,  and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the
market,  positive and negative,  and may experience  increased volatility of the
Investment  Funds' net asset  value.  The Fund  invests  in a limited  number of
Investment Funds. Such  concentration may result in additional risk.  Because of
the  limitation  on rights of  redemption  and the fact that the Fund's  limited
liability  company  interests will not be traded on any  securities  exchange or
other market and will be subject to substantial  restrictions  on transfer,  and
because  of the fact that the Fund may  invest in  Investment  Funds that do not
permit  frequent  withdrawals  and that may invest in  illiquid  securities,  an
investment  in  the  Fund  is  a  highly  illiquid  investment  and  involves  a
substantial  degree of risk.  Illiquid  securities owned by Investment Funds are
riskier than liquid  securities  because the Investment Funds may not be able to
dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates,
or may be able to dispose of the illiquid  securities  only at a greatly reduced
price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Investment Funds may cause investors to
incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund
during or following  periods of negative  performance.  Although the  Investment
Manager and the Managing  Member intend to recommend  that  quarterly  offers be
made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will make such offers.

8.   INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

At a meeting of Members that took place on March 27, 2006,  Members approved the
implementation,  with  effect  as of April  1,  2006 of new  Management  Fee and
Performance  Allocation terms for the fund. Under the new Investment  Management
Agreement, the Fund will pay the Investment Manager as full compensation for the
investment  management  services  performed  by the  Investment  Manager a fixed
monthly  fee  payable  monthly  equal  to  0.1042%  (approximately  1.25%  on an
annualized basis) of the month-end capital account of

each Member,  before giving effect to  repurchases,  repurchase fees (if any) or
the new performance allocation, and after giving effect to other expenses. There
is no change to the Manager  Administrative  Services  Fee. The new  Performance
Allocation terms provide for: (i) an annual preferred return (the "New Preferred
Return") equal to the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield for each month during the
year,  below which return by the Fund the Special Member receives no allocation;
and  (ii) a  reallocation  to the  Special  Member  of  10% of any  net  capital
appreciation  in  excess  of  the  New  Preferred  Return,  subject  to  a  loss
carryforward.  The new  Performance  Allocation  terms  do not  provide  for any
Catch-Up.

Through  May  1,  2006,  the  Fund  received  subscriptions  from  investors  of
$11,605,000 of which $6,655,000 was received in advance of March 31, 2006.

BOARD APPROVAL OF A NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

The Board met in person on January 18, 2006 for the purpose of, among other
things, considering whether it would be in the best interests of the Fund and
the Members to approve a new investment management agreement between the Fund
and the Investment Manager (the "New Investment Management Agreement") to take
effect (if approved by Members) upon the termination of the original Investment
Management Agreement then in effect. The New Investment Management Agreement was
part of the implementation of the new Management Fee and Performance Allocation
terms for the Fund that are described in Item 9 of the Notes to the Financial
Statements. At the January 18, 2006 Board meeting, and for the reasons described
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, unanimously
approved the New Investment Management Agreement and unanimously recommended its
approval by Members. At a meeting of Members that took place on March 27, 2006,
Members approved the New Investment Management Agreement to take effect as of
April 1, 2006.

In determining whether to approve the New Investment Management Agreement and
recommend that Members approve the agreement, the Board considered, among other
factors, the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the
Investment Manager, the performance of the Fund, the profitability of the Fund
to the Investment Manager, information about economies of scale, and the
differences between the original Investment Management Agreement and the New
Investment Management Agreement. In considering these factors, the Board
requested and reviewed a variety of information, including in comparison to such
information provided in May 2004 in connection with the Board's initial approval
of the original Investment Management Agreement.

In considering the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by
the Investment Manager, the Directors reviewed the services that the Investment
Manager provides to the Fund, and noted that the services to be provided under
the current and new agreement were the same. The Directors acknowledged that the
Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and allocates its
assets primarily among Investment Funds that are managed by third party
Portfolio Managers who employ a range of investment techniques and strategies.
The Investment Manager's services to the Fund have included investment
management services, including the selection and monitoring of Investment Funds
and Portfolio Managers and direct investments in certain other instruments;
maintaining appropriate accounts for the Fund's assets; and instructing certain
of the Fund's service providers in connection with the Fund's investments. The
Investment Manager's services also have included administrative services,
including providing office space and other support services; maintaining and
preserving certain records; preparing and filing various materials relating to
the Investment Manager with state and U.S. federal regulators; and reviewing and
arranging for payment of the Fund's expenses. The Directors considered, among
other things, the Investment Manager's management, personnel, resources, and
capabilities and experience in investing through third party Portfolio Managers.
The Directors also considered the Investment Manager's supervision of the Fund's
service providers and its attention to the compliance programs of the Fund, the
Investment Manager and certain other service providers.

The Directors reviewed the investment performance of the Fund since inception
and compared that performance to the Fund's investment objective, the
performance of certain indices and the Investment Manager's performance
expectations, including in the context of the proposed changes to the Fund's
incentive allocation.

The Directors considered the cost to the Investment Manager of the original
Investment Management Agreement and the profitability to the Investment Manager
and its affiliates of the relationship with the Fund over various time periods,
and as projected for the New Investment Management Agreement. The information
provided to the Directors indicated that the profitability to the Investment
Manager and its affiliates arising from the original Investment Management
Agreement has not been excessive and the profitability expected to arise from
the New Investment Management Agreement would not be excessive. The Directors
acknowledged certain benefits to the reputations of the Investment Manager and
the Fund from their association with each other.

The Directors considered services provided by other advisers to funds having
investment objectives and policies similar to those of the Fund. The Board
received, among other things, comparative data with respect to various types of
fund expenses. The Directors received information regarding the combined
advisory and administrative fees paid by other clients of the Investment Manager
that had investment objectives similar to that of the Fund. The Directors took
into account information provided by the Investment Manager about differences
between the Fund and those accounts, including with respect to incentive or
performance fees or allocations. In considering the extent of the fees received
by the Investment Manager for providing services to the Fund, the Directors
evaluated factors such as the fees and expenses borne by other registered funds
in the market pursuing strategies generally similar to those followed by the
Fund. The Directors considered the Fund's historical and proposed contractual
and net management fees, its anticipated expense ratio, and various components
of that expense ratio, along with its current and proposed performance
allocations, under various scenarios.

The Directors, in considering economies of scale, reviewed information showing
that the Fund had increased in size since inception but had not yet reached the
asset level set out in the Investment Manager's original long-term projections.
Notwithstanding this, the Directors noted that the terms of the New Investment
Management Agreement proposed by the Investment Manager, in combination with the
proposed changes to the Fund's incentive/performance allocation, would generally
result in lower amounts being paid by the Members to the Investment Manager and
its affiliates under the most likely scenarios for the Fund's performance and
3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yields.

The materials and other information described above were considered by the
Board, and also were considered separately by the Independent Directors. The
Directors did not identify any particular information or any single factor that
was controlling, or the particular weight any Director placed on any one factor
for purposes of determining whether to vote in approval of the New Investment
Management Agreement. The summary set out above describes the most important
factors, but not all of the matters considered by the Directors in coming to
their decision regarding the New Investment Management Agreement. On the basis
of their review, a majority of the Directors and, separately, a majority of the
Independent Directors concluded that each factor they considered, in the context
of all of the other factors they considered, favored approval of the New
Investment Management Agreement and the Board's recommendation to the Members
that they approve it.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                 J.P. MORGAN ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

OBJECTIVE

      J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. ("JPMAAM"), an investment
adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and an affiliate
of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ("JPMC"), is responsible for the allocation of assets
on behalf of its clients to various private investment funds, including hedge
funds and other alternative investment pools that are structured as private
limited partnerships, limited liability companies or offshore corporations
(collectively, "Alternative Investments"). The voting rights of Alternative
Investments generally are contract rights set forth in the organizational
documents (e.g., the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company or
memorandum and articles of association). As privately placed securities,
Alternative Investments generally are not subject to the regulatory scheme
applicable to public companies. Consequently, in most cases, Alternative
Investments do not issue proxies. Instead, they often solicit consents from
their limited partners, members or shareholders.

      As an investment manager, JPMAAM in the normal course of business is
typically granted by its clients the authority to vote the solicitations or
consents of Alternative Investments and the proxies of securities directly held
by clients that are not under the management of a sub-adviser (e.g., securities
that are received from in-kind redemptions). In accordance with the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and other applicable
fiduciary and regulatory standards, JPMAAM's objective is to vote the
solicitations, consents and proxies (hereinafter referred to as "proxies") in
the best interests of its clients. To further that objective, JPMAAM has adopted
these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.

THE PROXY VOTING PROCESS

1. VOTING IN GENERAL. JPMAAM's Portfolio Management Group ("PMG") as part of its
ongoing analysis of client holdings monitors significant developments relating
to the portfolio of Alternative Investments. BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF
ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS EACH SOLICITED VOTE RAISES UNIQUE QUESTIONS AND IS AN
INTEGRAL PART OF JPMAAM'S INVESTMENT PROCESS, EACH PROXY OR OTHER SOLICITATION
WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS WILL BE ANALYZED BY A MEMBER OR MEMBERS
OF THE PMG ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

For proxies received with respect to any securities other than Alternative
Investments held directly by JPMAAM's clients, for which JPMAAM has voting
responsibility, JPMAAM will defer the vote to a proxy voting service and vote in
accordance with their recommendation.

Situations may arise in which more than one client invests in the same
Alternative Investment or securities. In addition, two or more fund/clients may
be invested in strategies having different investment objectives, investment
styles or portfolio managers. As a result, JPMAAM may cast different votes on
behalf of different clients.

2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR VOTE FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS - PRIMARY CONTACT FOR THE
MANAGER OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGE FUND OR OTHER PERSON IDENTIFIED BY COMPLIANCE
OFFICER. Where the proxy being voted is with respect to

<PAGE>

interests in an underlying hedge fund ("UHF") owned by a JPMAAM client over
which JPMAAM has discretionary investment authority, it shall be the
responsibility of the Primary Contact in the PMG for the investment manager of
the UHF to vote the proxies in a timely manner and otherwise in accordance with
these procedures. In the absence of the Primary Contact, the Compliance Officer
shall assign such responsibility to another person in the PMG in accordance with
the procedures set forth below in this section.

3. PROCEDURES FOR VOTING PROXIES. JPMAAM has adopted the following procedures in
order to ensure that all proxy materials are processed in a timely fashion:

      o     All  proxies  and  related  materials  should  be  received  by,  or
            forwarded to, the  Operations  Group (the "OG") and processed by the
            designated person or persons within the OG.

      o     The OG will:

                  o     Forward the materials by e-mail to:

                        o     the Primary Contact for the manager of that UHF in
                              the PMG;

                        o     the Secondary Contact for that manager in the PMG;
                              and

                        o     the Compliance Officer.

                  o     Include in the cover email the following information:

                        o     name of UHF and manager;

                        o     name(s) of the JPMAAM client portfolio(s)  holding
                              interests in this UHF; and

                        o     the date and time by which  JPMAAM must submit the
                              proxy (the "Voting  Deadline").  (This is to allow
                              enough time for the completed proxy to be returned
                              to the issuer prior to the Voting Deadline.)

      o     The Compliance  Officer will promptly follow up via e-mail to ensure
            that  if  both  the  Primary  Contact  and  Secondary   Contact  are
            unavailable, the proxy material is assigned to another member of the
            PMG.  The  person  assigned   responsibility  (whether  the  Primary
            Contact,  Secondary  Contact,  or another PMG member) is referred to
            herein as the "PMG Designate".  If the Compliance Officer is absent,
            the Legal Department will perform this follow up.

      o     The PMG  Designate  will advise each PMG member who is the portfolio
            manager of a client portfolio  holding  interests in that UHF of the
            proxy solicitation,  and will analyze the proxy materials and make a
            decision on how to vote each  proxy,  conferring  with the  relevant
            portfolio  managers if  appropriate  (absent  material  conflicts of
            interest  - if there are  material  conflicts  of  interest,  follow
            procedures described below in "Material Conflicts of Interest"). The
            PMG Designate  shall promptly  communicate via email or otherwise in
            writing  the  decision  as to how to vote  each  proxy to the OG (by
            close of  business  on the day before the  Voting  Deadline,  unless
            otherwise  agreed with the OG),  copying the Compliance  Officer for
            purposes  of  recordkeeping.  Once  instructions  are  received in a
            timely   manner   from  the  PMG   Designate,   the  OG  shall  have
            responsibility for submitting the proxy prior to the Voting Deadline
            (and  providing  a copy of the proxy,  as voted,  to the  Compliance
            Officer).

      o     In some cases,  proxy materials  stipulate how a failure to vote the
            proxy  will  be  interpreted  (for  example,   proxy  materials  may
            stipulate that no vote will be deemed to be a vote for the proposal,
            or that there is no need to submit a proxy if there is an  intention
            to vote in favor of the proposal). In such a case, the PMG Designate
            must still determine how to vote the proxy, and convey this decision
            via email or other written communication to the OG, with copy to the
            Compliance Officer, as described above. If the PMG Designate decides
            that a proxy  should not be  submitted,  the OG shall  email the PMG
            Designate's decision to the UHF and keep a copy of that email in its
            files.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act requires that the proxy voting procedures
adopted and implemented by a registered investment adviser include procedures
that address material conflicts of interest that may arise between the
investment adviser and its clients. Material conflicts of interest may arise
when management of a JPMAAM investment management client or prospective client,
distributor or prospective distributor of its investment management products, or
critical vendor, is soliciting proxies and failure to vote in favor of

<PAGE>

management may affect JPMAAM's relationship with such company and materially
impact JPMAAM's business; or when a personal relationship between a JPMAAM
officer and management of a company or other proponents of proxy proposals could
impact the voting decision. JPMAAM is a part of the global financial services
firm JPMC. Material conflicts of interest could also arise between the interests
of JPMC and JPMAAM clients.

To address such material conflicts of interest, JPMC and JPMAAM have adopted
policies to safeguard the integrity of JPMAAM's investment processes and
decisions, including proxy voting, and to maintain the integrity and
independence of the investment process and decisions. JPMAAM has established
informational barriers designed to prevent the flow of information from JPMC's
securities, lending, investment banking and other divisions from reaching
JPMAAM's investment professionals.

In addition, JPMAAM has adopted the procedures discussed in the following
section to address material conflicts of interest.

ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The PMG Designate, along with the Compliance Officer, is responsible for
identifying potential material conflicts of interest. When a potential material
conflict of interest has been identified between the interests of JPMAAM and its
clients, it is the responsibility of the investment professional in consultation
with senior management and the Proxy Voting Committee (described below) to
evaluate the matter and determine whether an actual material conflict of
interest exists.

In the event an actual material conflict of interest exists, the final voting
decision will be made by the Proxy Voting Committee.

Depending upon the nature of the material conflict, JPMAAM may elect to take one
or more of the following measures, or other appropriate action:

      |_|   removing certain JPMAAM personnel from the proxy voting process;

      |_|   "walling off" personnel with knowledge of the material conflict to
            ensure that such personnel do not influence the relevant proxy vote;

      |_|   deferring the vote to a proxy voting service and vote in accordance
            with their recommendation

      |_|   deferring the vote to an independent person or body (e.g.,
            independent directors)

The resolution of all potential and actual material conflict issues presented to
the senior JPMAAM professionals will be thoroughly documented.

PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

A Proxy Voting Committee composed of senior individuals from JPMAAM, Legal,
Compliance, Risk Management and Operations Groups provides oversight of the
proxy voting process on an on-going basis. The primary purposes of the Committee
are to: periodically review general proxy voting matters and discuss and come to
conclusions on more controversial proxy voting issues.

RECORDKEEPING

JPMAAM is required to maintain in an easily accessible place for five (5) years
all records relating to the proxy voting process (the first two years at the
office of JPMAAM). Those records will be kept by the OG and will include the
following:

      |_|   a copy of the JPMAAM Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures;

      |_|   a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of JPMAAM clients;

      |_|   a record of each vote cast on behalf of JPMAAM client holdings;

      |_|   a copy of all documents created by JPMAAM personnel that were
            material to making a decision on the voting of client securities or
            that memorialize the basis of the decision; and

<PAGE>

      |_|   A copy of each written request by a client for information on how
            JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of the client, as well as a copy of
            any written response by JPMAAM to any request by a JPMAAM client for
            information on how JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of our client.

Adopted:  May 26, 2004

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Information  regarding the individuals  primarily  involved in the management of
the Fund's  portfolio is set out below.  This information is provided as of June
9, 2006.

PAUL ZUMMO is Chief  Investment  Officer and a Managing  Director of J.P. Morgan
Alternative  Asset  Management,  Inc.  (the  "Adviser"),  the Fund's  investment

investment analysis, research, due diligence and portfolio management.

COREY CASE is Chief Operating Officer and a Managing Director of the Adviser. He
has been with the Adviser  since January  2001,  has an extensive  background in
risk  management  and is responsible  for the  functional  oversight of the Risk
Management &  Quantitative  Analysis,  Client  Solutions,  Product  Development,
Geneva Advisory and Infrastructure groups within the Adviser.

REMI BOUTEILLE is Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Director of Research and a
Managing Director of the Adviser. He has been with the Adviser since 2000 and is
responsible  for  investment  analysis,  research,  due  diligence and portfolio

SCOT NORDEN is a Vice  President  of the  Adviser.  He has been with the Adviser
since March 2003 and is  responsible  for  investment  analysis,  research,  due

new manager sourcing and due diligence.

Scot Norden is primarily responsible for the day to day management of the Fund's
portfolio,  including  selecting  the  investment  funds in which  the Fund will
invest and  allocating  the Fund's  assets among those  investment  funds.  Paul
Zummo,  Corey Case and Remi  Bouteille  have  final  decision  making  authority
regarding  the  investment  funds  in  which  the Fund  (and  the  other  pooled
investment  vehicles  and  accounts  which are  managed by the  Adviser  ("Other
Adviser Accounts")) will be permitted to invest.

<PAGE>

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts  advised by the
persons named above and approximate assets under management in those accounts as
of March 31, 2006. The Adviser does not manage any other  registered  investment
companies.

Scot Norden                         1            $739.2 million (2)               0                      $0
</TABLE>

(1)   Of these  assets,  $119.2  million  across two vehicles are not subject to
      advisory fees based on performance.

(2)   $47.5  million of theses  assets are not subject to advisory fees based on
      performance.

Potential  conflicts of interest may arise  regarding the  allocation of limited
investment  opportunities  to the Fund and Other Adviser  Accounts.  Some of the
Other Adviser Accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that
differ from that of the Fund.  Different  investments  may be purchased  for the
Fund and for Other Adviser Accounts and the performance of investments purchased
by the Fund may differ from that of the investments  purchased for Other Adviser
Accounts.  Transactions  placed  on behalf of Other  Adviser  Accounts  that are
directly or indirectly  contrary to investment  decisions  made for the Fund may
have the  potential  to adversely  impact the Fund.  The Adviser has adopted and
implemented  policies  and  procedures  to address the  potential  conflicts  of
interest  associated  with  managing  multiple  accounts  on behalf of  multiple
clients. The Adviser monitors a variety of areas,  including compliance with any
stated  investment  guidelines and  restrictions and the performance of the Fund
and the Other  Adviser  Accounts,  to ensure that each account is being  managed
appropriately and in accordance with the Adviser's fiduciary  obligations to all
its clients.

<PAGE>

As of March 31, 2006, the Adviser's  portfolio  managers  receive a compensation
package  made  up  of  a  base  salary  and  an  annual   discretionary   bonus.
Discretionary  bonuses are closely tied to a variety of factors,  including  but
not  limited  to, the  investment  performance  of all  accounts  managed by the
Adviser, the Adviser's overall business  performance,  as well as the individual
portfolio manager's  contribution to that performance and the Adviser's business
generally  including the education,  training and support of the Adviser's other
personnel. Discretionary bonuses are comprised of a combination of mandatory and
voluntary bonus deferral programs and a cash component. Mandatory bonus deferral
is generally in the form of JPMorgan Chase stock,  subject to a vesting  period.
For certain senior portfolio  managers,  a part of the mandatory deferral amount
may  be  allocated  among  different   investment  choices  including  a  pooled
investment vehicle managed by the Adviser, also subject to a vesting period. The

                     J.P. MORGAN MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, L.L.C.

                                 CODE OF ETHICS

1.    Purposes

      This Code of Ethics (the "Code") has been adopted by the  Directors of the
J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy  Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"),  in accordance with Rule
17j-1(c)  promulgated under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Act"). Rule 17j-1 under the Act generally proscribes fraudulent or manipulative
practices  with  respect  to  purchases  or  sales of  Securities  Held or to be
Acquired by  investment  companies,  if effected by  associated  persons of such
companies.  The purpose of this Code is to provide  regulations  and  procedures
consistent  with the Act and Rule 17j-1  designed  to give effect to the general
prohibitions set forth in Rule 17j-1(b) as follows:

            It is unlawful for any affiliated person of or principal underwriter
for the Fund, or any affiliated person of an investment  adviser of or principal
underwriter for the Fund, in connection  with the purchase or sale,  directly or
indirectly, by the person of a Security Held or to be Acquired by the Fund --

      (a)   To employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Fund;

      (b)   To make any untrue  statement of a material fact to the Fund or omit
            to state a material fact  necessary in order to make the  statements
            made to the Fund, in light of the circumstances under which they are
            made, not misleading;

      (c)   To engage in any act, practice,  or course of business that operates
            or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the Fund; or

      (d)   To engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund.

2.    Definitions

      (a)   "Access  Person" means any  Director,  officer,  managing  member or

      (b)   "Adviser" means J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc.

      (c) "Advisory  Person" of the Fund means: any employee of the Fund (or any
company  in a control  relationship  to the Fund) who,  has access to  nonpublic
information regarding the purchase or sale of securities for a Fund or nonpublic
information  regarding a Fund's portfolio holdings, or whose functions relate to
the making of any recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales or who
has access to such recommendations that are nonpublic; and any natural person in
a  control   relationship  to  the  Fund  who  obtains  information   concerning
recommendations  made to the Fund with regard to the purchase or sale of Covered
Securities by the Fund.

<PAGE>

      (d) "Beneficial  Ownership"  shall be interpreted in the same manner as it
would be under Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(a)(2) in determining  whether a person is
the beneficial  owner of a security for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (see Annex A). Any
report  required by Section  5(a) of this Code may contain a statement  that the
report will not be construed as an admission  that the person  making the report
has any direct or indirect  beneficial  ownership  in the  Security to which the
report relates.

      (e)  "Covered  Security"  shall  have the  meaning  set  forth in  Section
2(a)(36) of the Act,  except that it shall not include shares of open-end funds,
direct obligations of the United States Government,  bankers' acceptances,  bank
certificates  of deposit,  commercial  paper and high  quality  short-term  debt
instruments, including repurchase agreements.

      (f) "Control" has the same meaning as in Section 2(a)(9) of the Act.

      (g)  "Disinterested  Director"  means a Director of the Fund who is not an
"interested  person" of the Fund within the  meaning of Section  2(a)(19) of the
Act.

      (h) "Initial Public  Offering" means an offering of securities  registered
under the Securities Act of 1933,  the issuer of which,  immediately  before the
registration,  was not subject to the reporting  requirements  of Sections 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.

      (i) "Investment  Personnel"  means (i) any employee of the Fund (or of any
company in a control  relationship  to the Fund) who, in connection  with his or
her regular functions or duties, makes or participates in making recommendations
regarding the purchase or sale of  securities by the Fund;  and (ii) any natural
person  who   controls   the  Fund  and  who  obtains   information   concerning
recommendations made to the Fund regarding the purchase or sale of securities by
the Fund.

      (j) "Limited  Offering" means an offering that is exempt from registration
under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) or Section 4(6) or pursuant to
Rule 504, Rule 505, or Rule 506 under the Securities Act.

      (k) "Purchase or Sale of a Covered  Security"  includes,  inter alia,  the

into or  exchangeable  for, a Covered  Security  described in Section 2(l)(i) of
this Code.

      (m) "Automatic  Investment Plan" means a program in which regular periodic
purchases  (or  withdrawals)  are made  automatically  in (or  from)  investment
accounts  in  accordance  with  a  predetermined  schedule  and  allocation.  An
Automatic Investment Plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan.

3.    Prohibited Purchases and Sales

      (a) No Access Person shall  purchase or sell  directly or  indirectly  any
Covered  Security  in which  he or she has,  or by  reason  of such  transaction
acquires,  any direct or indirect  Beneficial  Ownership and which to his or her
actual knowledge at the time of such purchase or sale:

            (i)   is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund; or

            (ii)  is being purchased or sold by the Fund.

      (b) No Access  Person  shall  reveal to any other  person  (except  in the
normal  course of his or her  duties  on  behalf  of the  Fund) any  information
regarding  Covered  Securities  transactions by the Fund or consideration by the
Fund or its adviser of any such Covered Securities transactions.

      (c) No Access Person shall recommend any Covered Securities transaction by
the Fund without having  disclosed his or her interest,  if any, in such Covered
Securities or the issuer thereof,  including  without  limitation (i) his or her
direct or  indirect  Beneficial  Ownership  of any  Covered  Securities  of such
issuer,  (ii)  any  contemplated  transaction  by such  person  in such  Covered
Securities  (iii) any position with such issuer or its  affiliates  and (iv) any
present or proposed business relationship between such issuer or its affiliates,
on the one  hand,  and such  person  or any  party in which  such  person  has a
significant  interest,  on the other;  provided,  however, that in the event the
interest  of such  Access  Person in such  Covered  Securities  or issuer is not
material to his or her personal net worth and any  contemplated  transaction  by
such person in such Covered  Securities  cannot reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on any such transaction by the Fund or on the market for
the Covered  Securities  generally,  such Access Person shall not be required to
disclose  his or her  interest in the Covered  Securities  or issuer  thereof in
connection with any such recommendation.

      (d) No Investment  Personnel shall purchase any Covered  Security which is
part of an Initial Public Offering.

4.    Exempted Transactions

      The prohibitions of Section 3 of this Code shall not apply to:


                                       3
<PAGE>

      (a)  Purchases  or sales  effected  in any  account  over which the Access
Person has no direct or indirect influence or control.

      (b)  Purchases or sales of Covered  Securities  which are not eligible for
purchase or sale by the Fund.

      (e) Purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer pro
rata to all  holders of a class of its  Covered  Securities,  to the extent such
rights were acquired from such issuer, and sales of such rights so acquired.

      (f) Purchases or sales which are only remotely  potentially harmful to the
Fund  because  they  would be very  unlikely  to  affect a highly  institutional
market,  or because  they  clearly are not related  economically  to the Covered
Securities to be purchased, sold or held by the Fund.

5.    Reporting Requirements

                  Director,  at the time of that  transaction,  knew,  or in the
                  ordinary  course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a
                  Director  of the Fund,  should  have  known,  that  during the
                  15-day  period  immediately  before  or after  the date of the
                  Director's  transaction  in a Covered  Security,  such Covered

      (d)   All reports prepared  pursuant to this Section 5 shall be filed with
            the person  designated  by the  Adviser's  compliance  department to

      reasonable, periodic, special or other examination:

            (a) A copy of each code of ethics of the  Adviser,  distributor  and
      the Fund that is in effect,  or at any time within the past five years was

      Section 5(a) of this Code, including any information provided in lieu of a
      quarterly  transaction  report, must be maintained for at least five years
      after  the end of the  fiscal  year in  which  the  report  is made or the
      information  is  provided,  the first  two  years in an easily  accessible

      must approve the code of ethics of the Fund,  the Adviser and  distributor
      and any material  change to these codes.  The Board must base its approval
      of a code and any material changes to the code on a determination that the
      code contains  provisions  reasonably  necessary to prevent Access Persons
      from  engaging in any conduct  prohibited  by Rule  17j-1(b) of the Act as
      described  in  Section  1.  Before  approving  the  codes of the  Adviser,
      distributor and the Fund, the Fund's Board must receive certification from
      the  Adviser,  distributor  and the Fund that each has adopted  procedures
      reasonably  necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating its code of
      ethics.  The Fund's  Board must  approve  the codes of the Adviser and the
      distributor  before  initially  retaining  the  services of the Adviser or
      distributor. The Fund's Board must approve a material change to a code not
      later than six months after adoption of the material change.  The Adviser,
      distributor and the Fund must each use reasonable  diligence and institute
      procedures  reasonably  necessary  to  prevent  violations  of its code of
      ethics.

      b. No less frequently  than annually,  the Adviser,  distributor,  and the
      Fund must furnish to the Fund's Board a written report that:

                                     ANNEX A

      The term  "beneficial  owner"  shall  mean any  person  who,  directly  or
indirectly, through any contract,  arrangement,  understanding,  relationship or
otherwise,  has or  shares  a  direct  or  indirect  pecuniary  interest  in the
securities, subject to the following:

(i) The term  "pecuniary  interest"  in any class of  securities  shall mean the
opportunity,  directly or  indirectly,  to profit or share in any profit derived
from a transaction in the subject securities.

(ii) The term  "indirect  pecuniary  interest" in any class of securities  shall
include, but not be limited to:

      (A)   Securities  held by members of a person's  immediate  family sharing
            the same household;  provided, however, that the presumption of such
            beneficial ownership may be rebutted;

      (B)   A  general  partner's   proportionate   interest  in  the  portfolio
            securities  held by a general or limited  partnership.  The  general
            partner's  proportionate  interest,  as evidenced by the partnership
            agreement  in  effect  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  and  the
            partnership's most recent financial statements, shall be the greater
            of: (1) the general  partner's share of the  partnership's  profits,
            including profits  attributed to any limited  partnership  interests
            held by the general  partner and any other interests in profits that
            arise  from the  purchase  and sale of the  partnership's  portfolio
            securities;  or (2) the general  partner's  share of the partnership
            capital  account,  including the share  attributable  to any limited
            partnership interest held by the general partner;

      (C)   A  performance-related  fee, other than an asset-based fee, received
            by any broker, dealer, bank, insurance company,  investment company,
            investment adviser,  investment manager, trustee or person or entity
            performing a similar function;  provided, however, that no pecuniary
            interest  shall be present  where (1) the  performance-related  fee,
            regardless  of when payable,  is  calculated  based upon net capital
            gains and/or net capital  appreciation  generated from the portfolio
            or from the  fiduciary's  overall  performance  over a period of one
            year or more;  and (2)  securities  of the issuer do not account for
            more than 10 percent of the market value of the  portfolio.  A right
            to  a  nonperformance-related   fee  alone  shall  not  represent  a
            pecuniary interest in the securities;

      (D)   A person's  right to dividends  that is separated or separable  from
            the underlying  securities.  Otherwise,  a right to dividends  alone
            shall not represent a pecuniary interest in the securities;

      (E)   A person's interest in the securities held by a trust, as follows:


                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (1)  TRUSTEES.  If a  trustee  has a  pecuniary  interest,  as
                  provided  above, in any holding or transaction in the issuer's
                  securities  held by the trust,  such  holding  or  transaction
                  shall be attributed to the trustee in the trustee's individual
                  capacity,  as well as on behalf of the trust.  With respect to
                  performance  fees  and  holdings  of the  trustee's  immediate
                  family,  trustees shall be deemed to have a pecuniary interest
                  in the  trust  holdings  and  transactions  in  the  following
                  circumstances: (i) a performance fee is received that does not
                  meet the proviso of paragraph  (ii)(C) above;  or (ii)at least
                  one  beneficiary  of the  trust is a member  of the  trustee's
                  immediate  family.  The  pecuniary  interest of the  immediate
                  family member(s) shall be attributed to the trustee;

                  (2) BENEFICIARIES. A beneficiary shall have or share reporting
                  obligations  with  respect  to  transactions  in the  issuer's
                  securities  held  by  the  trust,  if  the  beneficiary  is  a
                  beneficial owner of the securities, as follows:

                        (aa) If a beneficiary shares investment control with the
                        trustee  with  respect  to  a  trust  transaction,   the
                        transaction  shall be attributed to both the beneficiary
                        and the trust;

                        (bb)  If  a  beneficiary  has  investment  control  with
                        respect to a trust transaction without consultation with
                        the trustee,  the transaction shall be attributed to the
                        beneficiary only; and

                        (cc)  In  making  a   determination   as  to  whether  a
                        beneficiary is the beneficial  owner of the  securities,
                        beneficiaries  shall  be  deemed  to  have  a  pecuniary
                        interest in the issuer's securities held by the trust to
                        the extent of their pro rata interest in the trust where
                        the  trustee  does  not  exercise  exclusive  investment
                        control.

                  (3)  SETTLORS.  If a settlor  reserves the right to revoke the
                  trust  without  the  consent  of  another  person,  the  trust
                  holdings and  transactions  shall be attributed to the settlor
                  instead of the trust;  provided,  however, that if the settlor
                  does  not  exercise  or  share  investment  control  over  the
                  issuer's  securities held by the trust, the trust holdings and
                  transactions  shall be  attributed to the trust instead of the
                  settlor; and

            (F)   A person's right to acquire securities through the exercise or
                  conversion  of  any  derivative   security,   whether  or  not
                  presently exercisable.

      (iii) A  shareholder  shall not be deemed to have a pecuniary  interest in
      the portfolio  securities held by a corporation or similar entity in which
      the  person  owns  securities  if the  shareholder  is  not a  controlling
      shareholder  of the entity and does not have or share  investment  control
      over the entity's portfolio.
