                                 PRIVACY NOTICE

The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial privacy.
Each of the financial institutions identified below has in effect the following
policy ("Privacy Policy") with respect to nonpublic personal information about
its customers:

   -  Only such information received from you, through application forms or
      otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will
      be collected. This may include information such as name, address, social
      security, tax status, account balances and transactions.

   -  None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed
      to anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to
      employees necessary to service your account). In the normal course of
      servicing a customer's account, Eaton Vance may share information with
      unaffiliated third parties that perform various required services such as
      transfer agents, custodians and broker/dealers.

   -  Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural
      safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality
      of such information.

   -  We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time upon proper
      notification to you. Customers may want to review our Policy periodically
      for changes by accessing the link on our homepage: www.eatonvance.com.

Our pledge of privacy applies to the following entities within the Eaton Vance
organization: the Eaton Vance Family of Funds, Eaton Vance Management, Eaton
Vance Investment Counsel, Boston Management and Research, and Eaton Vance
Distributors, Inc.

In addition, our Privacy Policy only applies only to those Eaton Vance customers
who are individuals and who have a direct relationship with us. If a customer's
account (i.e., fund shares) is held in the name of a third-party financial
adviser/broker-dealer, it is likely that only such adviser's privacy policies
apply to the customer. This notice supersedes all previously issued privacy
disclosures.

            For more information about Eaton Vance's Privacy Policy,
                          please call 1-800-262-1122.

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE
                              REGARDING DELIVERY OF
                              SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

The Fund will file a schedule of its portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the first and third quarters
of each fiscal year. The Fund's Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance
website www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the
EDGAR database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Form N-Q may also be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's public reference room in Washington, D.C. (call
1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the public reference room).

From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This
description is also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's
website at http://www.sec.gov.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of October 31, 2004
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

THE FUND

Performance

- -  Based on the Fund's October 2004 monthly dividend of $0.1345 and a closing
   share price of $19.25, the Fund had a market yield of 8.38%.(1)

- -  Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Fund had a
   total return of 12.84% for the six months ended October 31, 2004. That return
   was the result of an increase in share price from $17.81 on April 30, 2004 to
   $19.25 on October 31, 2004 and the reinvestment of $0.807 in regular monthly
   dividends.(1)

- -  Based on net asset value, the Fund had a total return of 4.12% for the six
   months ended October 31, 2004. That return was the result of a decrease in
   net asset value per share from $19.07 on April 30, 2004 to $19.02 on October
   31, 2004, and the reinvestment of all distributions.

   The Fund's Investments

- -  Among the corporate loan and bond portfolio portions of the Fund, the Fund's
   managers continued to emphasize broad industry diversification. Investments
   included companies in cyclical sectors that may benefit from a continued
   recovery in overall economic activity. The Fund also had commitments in
   defensive, non-economically sensitive companies whose revenues derive from
   non-discretionary expenditures and are, therefore, less reliant on a
   sustained recovery. At October 31, 2004, the Fund's investments represented
   52 industries, with no single sector representing as much as 8% of the Fund's
   net assets. The largest industry weightings were telecommunications, health
   care, chemicals and plastics, radio and television and publishing.

- -  Due to improving fundamentals and strong technical factors in the loan
   market, loan credit spreads for new issues narrowed and prices averaged
   above-par in the secondary market. These trends have increased the importance
   of diligent risk-management.

- -  Among its high-yield corporate bond investments, while management continued
   its historical focus on the B-rated portion of the high-yield market, the
   Fund was less involved in turnaround situations, focusing instead on B-rated
   bonds that management believes may be positioned for an upgrade. The Fund's
   chemical investments fared especially well, as producers of commodity
   chemicals and specialty chemicals alike have seen increased demand in
   response to a stronger economy. These companies have products used in
   industrial processes and are thus leveraged to a turnaround in the broader
   cyclical economy and could benefit from an upturn in manufacturing.

- -  The mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market improved somewhat during the
   year. Seasoned MBS spreads were around 150 basis points (1.50%) at October
   31, 2004, down from 175 basis points (1.75%) at April 30, 2004. Prepayment
   rates for the Fund's seasoned MBS declined significantly over the course of
   the year, falling to near 25% by October 31, 2004 from from their peak around
   50% in 2003. Interestingly, while this trend marked a significant
   improvement, the rate of decline was somewhat below expectations due, in
   part, to a flattening of the yield curve. That is, while short-term rates
   rose, longer-term rates moved slightly lower, keeping 30-year mortgage rates
   near historical lows. We believe that seasoned MBS may fare better in a
   stable-to slightly-higher long-term interest rate scenario. Signs of a
   sustained economic recovery would likely pressure long-term rates higher.

   THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND
   ARE CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON
   THE COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET
   OR OTHER CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE
   SUCH VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND,
   BECAUSE INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY
   FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF
   OF ANY EATON VANCE FUND.

(1) THE FUND'S MARKET YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MOST RECENT DIVIDEND
    PER SHARE BY THE SHARE MARKET PRICE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND
    ANNUALIZING THE RESULT. (2) RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY
    DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE PRICE (AS
    APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. PERFORMANCE RESULTS REFLECT
    THE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM THE FUND'S ISSUANCE OF AUCTION
    PREFERRED SHARES. IN THE EVENT OF A RISE IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, THE
    VALUE OF THE FUND'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE
    THE ASSET COVERAGE FOR ITS AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES.

          PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE
          HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN
          NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS
          REINVESTED. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO
          THAT SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR
          ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME PERIOD ONLY; DUE TO
          MARKET VOLATILITY, THE FUND'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR
          HIGHER THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

FUND SHARES ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES ARE SUBJECT
TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTED. YIELDS WILL
VARY.

Fund had unfunded loan commitments of $7,878,070 as of October 31, 2004.
PIK - Payment In Kind.
(1)  Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
     flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
     borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election,
     cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
     maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
     However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests will
     have an expected average life of approximately two to three years. The
     stated interest rate represents the weighted average interest rate of all
     contracts within the senior loan facility.
(2)  Security valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
     at the direction of the Trustees.
(3)  All or a portion of these securities were on loan at October 31, 2004.
(4)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. these securities may be sold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At October 31,
     2004, the aggregate value of the securities is $287,887,932 or 13.6% of the
     Fund's net assets.
(5)  Defaulted bond.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of October 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Limited Duration Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified closed-end
   management investment company. The Fund, which was organized as a
   Massachusetts business trust on March 12, 2003, seeks to provide a high level
   of current income. The Fund may, as a secondary objective, also seek capital
   appreciation to the extent consistent with its primary goal of high current
   income. The Fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in,
   mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued, backed or otherwise guaranteed by
   the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; senior, secured
   floating rate loans made to corporate and other business entities (Senior
   Loans); and corporate bonds of below investment grade quality (Non-Investment
   Grade Bonds). The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
   of the Fund. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles
   generally accepted in the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Seasoned mortgage backed, pass-through securities
   are valued using an independent matrix pricing system applied by the adviser
   which takes into account closing bond valuations, yield differentials,
   anticipated prepayments and interest rates provided by dealers. Debt
   securities (other than seasoned mortgage backed, pass-through securities) are
   normally valued on the basis of valuations furnished by dealers or a pricing
   service. Certain senior loans are deemed to be liquid because reliable market
   quotations are readily available for them. Liquid senior loans are valued on
   the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service. Other senior loans are
   valued at fair value by the Fund's investment adviser, Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM), under procedures established by the Trustees as permitted by Section
   2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include the
   consideration of relevant factors, data and information relating to fair
   value, including (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data
   relating to the Senior Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate,
   period until next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the
   Senior Loan, the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related
   agreements, and the position of the Senior Loan in the Borrower's debt
   structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including
   the Fund's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral;
   (iii) the creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on an evaluation of its
   financial condition, financial statements and information about the
   Borrower's business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv)
   information relating to the market for the Senior Loan including price
   quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan, and interests in similar
   Senior Loans and the market environment and investor attitudes towards the
   Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior Loans; (v) the experience, the
   reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and any
   intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general economic and
   market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Other
   portfolio securities (other than short-term obligations, but including listed
   issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing
   services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units
   of such securities which may use market information, transactions for
   comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are
   generally recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances,
   portfolio securities will be valued at the last sales price on the exchange
   that is the primary market for such securities, or the last quoted bid price
   for those securities for which the over-the-counter market is the primary
   market or for listed securities in which there were no sales during the day.
   The value of interest rate swaps will be based on dealer quotations.
   Short-term obligations which mature in 60 days or less, are valued at
   amortized cost, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Fund
   was 60 days or less or are valued at amortized cost using their value on the
   61st day prior to maturity, if their original term to maturity when acquired
   by the Fund was more than 60 days, unless in each case this is determined not
   to represent fair value. OTC options are valued at the mean between the bid
   and asked price provided by dealers. Financial futures contracts listed on
   commodity exchanges and exchange traded options are valued at closing
   settlement prices. Securities for which there is no such quotation or
   valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by
   or at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost
   plus accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for which there are no
   quotations or valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith
   by or on behalf of the Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or accretion of discount. Dividend income is recorded on the
   ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

                                       26
<Page>

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
   net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
   income or excise tax is necessary. At April 30, 2004, the Fund, for federal
   income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $26,481,368 which will
   reduce the Fund's taxable income arising from future net realized gains on
   investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code,
   and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders which
   would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Fund of any liability for federal
   income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover will expire on April 30,
   2012.

   At April 30, 2004, net capital losses of $17,668,020 attributable to security
   transactions incurred after October 31, 2003, are treated as arising on the
   first day of the Fund's taxable year ending April 30, 2005.

   D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with the
   offering of the common shares were recorded as a reduction of capital paid in
   excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Fund. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balances the Fund maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the
   Fund's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses on the
   Statement of Operations.

   G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount
   equal to the premium received by the Fund is included in the Statement of
   Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is
   subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
   written in accordance with the Fund's policies on investment valuations
   discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
   treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are
   exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount
   paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a put
   option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities
   purchased by the Fund. The Fund, as writer of an option, may have no control
   over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or purchased (put)
   and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price
   of the securities underlying the written option.

   H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium
   paid by the Fund is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an
   investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to
   reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with
   the Fund's policies on investment valuations discussed above. If an option
   which the Fund has purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date, the
   Fund will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option. If the Fund
   enters into a closing sale transaction, the Fund will realize a gain or loss,
   depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction are
   greater or less than the cost of the option. If a Fund exercises a put
   option, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying
   security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium
   originally paid. If the Fund exercises a call option, the cost of the
   security which the Fund purchases upon exercise will be increased by the
   premium originally paid.

   I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
   contract, the Fund is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either
   in cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Fund.

   If the Fund enters into a closing transaction, the Fund will realize, for
   book purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
   the financial futures contract to sell and the financial futures contract to
   buy. The Fund's investment in financial futures contracts is designed only to
   hedge against anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should interest
   rates move unexpectedly, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
   the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

                                       27
<Page>

   J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase
   agreements. Under such an agreement, the Fund temporarily transfers
   possession, but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in return for
   cash. At the same time, the Fund agrees to repurchase the security at an
   agreed-upon price and time in the future. The Fund may enter into reverse
   repurchase agreements for temporary purposes, such as to fund withdrawals, or
   for use as hedging instruments where the underlying security is denominated
   in a foreign currency. As a form of leverage, reverse repurchase agreements
   may increase the risk of fluctuation in the market value of the Fund's assets
   or in its yield. Liabilities to counterparties under reverse repurchase
   agreements are recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities at the
   same time at which cash is received by the Fund. The securities underlying
   such agreements continue to be treated as owned by the Fund and remain in the
   Portfolio of Investments. Interest charged on amounts borrowed by the Fund
   under reverse repurchase agreements is accrued daily.

   K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements to hedge
   against fluctuations in securities prices, interest rates or market
   conditions; to change the duration of the portfolio; to mitigate default
   risk; or for other risk management purposes. Pursuant to these agreements,
   the Fund makes monthly payments at a rate equal to a predetermined spread to
   the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Fund receives payments based on the
   rate of return of a benchmark industry index. During the term of the
   outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap are
   recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or made at the end
   of the measurement period are recorded as realized gains and losses. The
   value of the swap is determined by changes in the relationship between the
   rate of interest and the benchmark industry index. The Fund is exposed to
   credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap counterparty.
   However, the Fund does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty.
   Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value of interest
   rates or the index.

   L OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   securities are purchased or sold. Realized gains and losses are computed
   based on the specific identification of securities sold.

   M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   N INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers
   and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses
   arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund, and shareholders
   are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of the Fund.
   Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into
   agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses.
   The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
   involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet
   occurred.

   O INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating
   to October 31, 2004 and for the six months then ended have not been audited
   by an independent registered public accounting firm, but in the opinion of
   the Fund's management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal
   recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial
   statements.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   The Fund issued 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A, 7,600
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B, 7,600 shares of Auction
   Preferred Shares Series C, 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D,
   and 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series E on July 25, 2003 in a
   public offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were
   recorded as a reduction of the capital of the common shares. As of October
   31, 2004, 6,400 shares of Series A, 6,400 shares of Series B, 6,400 shares of
   Series C, 6,400 shares of Series D and 6,400 shares of Series E were
   outstanding. During the six months ended October 31, 2004, the Fund redeemed
   6,000 preferred shares at a cost of $150,000,000. Dividends on the APS, which
   accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering
   of the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction.
   Dividend rates ranged from 1.12% to 1.92% for Series A Shares, from 1.09% to
   1.94% for Series B Shares, from 1.15% to 1.90% for Series C Shares, from
   1.18% to 1.94% for Series D Shares and from 1.10% to 1.90% for Series E
   Shares, during the six months ended October 31, 2004.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset

                                       28

   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Fund is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
   Fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the Auction
   Preferred Shares on October 31, 2004 was 1.85%, 1.87%, 1.86%, 1.90% and
   1.80%, for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Shares,
   respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2004, the Fund paid
   dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $1,467,489,
   $1,460,793, $1,447,039, $1,469,928, and $1,443,972 for Series A, Series B,
   Series C, Series D and Series E Shares, respectively, representing an average
   APS dividend rate for such period of 1.55%, 1.54%, 1.53%, 1.56% and 1.52%,
   respectively.

   The Fund distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the different treatment for paydown gain/losses on
   mortgage-backed securities and the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's
   weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management (EVM), as
   compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
   Fund. For the six months ended October 31, 2004, the fee was equivalent to
   0.75% (annualized) of the Fund's average weekly gross assets for such period
   and amounted to $11,896,668.

   In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for
   fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% (annualized) of average weekly
   gross assets of the Fund for the first five years of the Fund's operations
   0.15% of average weekly gross assets of the Fund in year 6, 0.10% in year 7
   and 0.05% in year 8. For the six months ended October 31, 2004, the
   Investment Adviser waived $3,172,445 of its advisory fee.

   EVM serves as the administrator of the Fund, but currently receives no
   compensation for providing administrative services to the Fund.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are officers of the above
   organizations.

5  PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

   Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations and
   including paydowns, aggregated $998,267,857 and $1,004,279,184, respectively,
   for the six months ended October 31, 2004.

6  SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT

   The Fund has established a securities lending agreement with brokers in which
   the Fund lends portfolio securities to a broker in exchange for collateral
   consisting of either cash or U.S. government securities in an amount at least
   equal to the market value of the securities on loan. Under the agreement, the
   Fund continues to earn interest on the securities loaned. Collateral received
   is generally cash, and the Fund invests the cash and receives any interest on
   the amount invested but it must also pay the broker a loan rebate fee
   computed as a varying percentage of the collateral received. The loan rebate
   fee paid by the Fund offsets a portion of the interest income received and
   amounted to $955,119 for the six months ended October 31, 2004. At October
   31, 2004, the value of the securities loaned and the value of the collateral
   amounted to $216,333,374 and $221,705,085, respectively. In the event of
   counterparty default, the Fund is subject to potential loss if it is delayed
   or prevented from exercising its right to dispose of the collateral. The Fund
   bears risk in the event that invested collateral is not sufficient to meet
   obligations due on the loans. The Fund has the right under the lending
   agreement to recover the securities from the borrower on demand.

9  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The Fund regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include written
   options and financial futures contracts, and may involve, to a varying
   degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial
   statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
   represent the investment the Fund has in particular classes of financial
   instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially
   subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these
   instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions
   are considered. At October 31, 2004 there were no outstanding obligations
   under these financial instruments.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Fund. You may elect to
participate in the Plan be completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Application
Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions in cash paid
by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying agent. On the
distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new
Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be determined by the greater
of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares
generally will be purchased on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions
subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Fund's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Fund. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not required in this filing.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) It is the conclusion of the registrant's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer that the effectiveness of the registrant's current
disclosure controls and procedures (such disclosure controls and procedures
having been evaluated within 90 days of the date of this filing) provide

to the registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the registrant's internal controls over

reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
