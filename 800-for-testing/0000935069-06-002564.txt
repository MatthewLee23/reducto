                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The Gabelli  Utility Trust (the "Fund") is a  non-diversified
closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware statutory trust
on February 25, 1999 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended  (the "1940  Act").  The Fund had no  operations  prior to July 9, 1999,
other than the sale of 10,000 shares of beneficial  interest for $100,000 to The
Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity  Trust") at $10.00 per share.  On July 9,
1999,  the Fund had a 4 for 3 stock split  increasing the balance of Fund shares
held by the  Equity  Trust  to  13,333.  On  July  9,  1999,  the  Equity  Trust
contributed  $79,487,260  in cash and  securities  in exchange for shares of the
Fund, and on the same date distributed such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders
of  record  on July 1,  1999 at the rate of one  share of the Fund for every ten
shares of the Equity Trust. Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

      The Fund's  primary  objective is long-term  growth of capital and income.
The Fund will invest 80% of its  assets,  under  normal  market  conditions,  in
common stocks and other securities of foreign and domestic companies involved in
providing   products,   services,   or  equipment  for  (i)  the  generation  or
distribution of electricity, gas, and water and (ii) telecommunications services
or infrastructure  operations (the "80% Policy").  The 80% Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval.  However, the Fund has adopted a policy to provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good  faith to reflect  its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these securities will
be fair valued as determined by the Board.  Debt  instruments  having a maturity
greater  than 60 days for which  market  quotations  are readily  available  are
valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there were no asked
prices  quoted on such day,  the security is valued using the closing bid price.
Futures contracts are valued at the closing  settlement price of the exchange or
board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  fair  valued  as  determined  by  the  Board.   Fair   valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At June 30,
2006, the Fund had an investment of $24,517,000 in a repurchase agreement.

      SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Fund would agree to pay to the other party to the interest  rate swap
(which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate  payment in
exchange  for  the  counterparty  agreeing  to pay to the  Fund  periodically  a
variable rate payment that is intended to approximate  the Fund's  variable rate
payment obligation on the Series B Preferred Stock. In an interest rate cap, the
Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty and, to the extent that a specified
variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate,  would receive from the
counterparty  payments of the  difference  based on the notional  amount of such
cap. Interest rate swap and cap transactions  introduce  additional risk because
the Fund would remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock  dividends  when due in
accordance with the Articles  Supplementary even if the counterparty  defaulted.
If there is a default by the  counterparty to a swap contract,  the Fund will be
limited  to  contractual  remedies  pursuant  to the  agreements  related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be
able to meet their  obligations  pursuant to the swap  contracts or that, in the
event of default,  the Fund will succeed in pursuing contractual  remedies.  The
Fund thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining
payments owed to it pursuant to the swap contracts.  The creditworthiness of the
swap  contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in order to minimize  this
risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the
returns on the Fund's portfolio securities at that point in time, such a default
could  negatively  affect the Fund's  ability to make dividend  payments for the
Series B Preferred Stock. In addition,  at the time an interest rate swap or cap
transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,  there is a risk that the
Fund will not be able to obtain a replacement  transaction  or that the terms of
the replacement will not be as favorable as on the expiring transaction. If this
occurs,  it could have a negative  impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend
payments on the Series B Preferred Stock.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
Changes in the value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps,  are reported as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

      The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement, the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2006 are as follows:

* Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Fund may  engage  in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase.  Upon entering into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/depreciation   on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The  Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open
futures contracts.

      FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

of such  transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from changes in
foreign  exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting
from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      FOREIGN TAXES.  The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income,  gains
on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the trade date with  realized  gains or losses on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

      CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS.  When cash  balances are  maintained in the custody
account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to offset custodian fees. The
gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are included in custodian fees
in the Statement of Operations with the  corresponding  expense offset,  if any,
shown as "custodian fee credits".

      DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with Federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications  have no impact on the NAV of the Fund.  For the  fiscal  year
ended December 31, 2005,  reclassifications were made to decrease net investment
income by $54,526,  and to decrease  accumulated  distributions in excess of net
realized gain on investments,  swap contracts, and foreign currency transactions
by $54,526.

      Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred   Stock  and  Series  B  Auction  Rate   Cumulative   Preferred  Stock
("Cumulative  Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined
as described in Note 5.

      PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of its average  weekly
net assets including the liquidation value of the preferred stock. In accordance
with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous  investment
program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of all aspects
of the  Fund's  business  and  affairs.  The  Adviser  has  agreed to reduce the
management  fee  on  the  incremental  assets  attributable  to  the  Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the net asset value ("NAV") of the common
shares  of the  Fund,  including  distributions  and  advisory  fee  subject  to
reduction,  does not exceed the stated dividend rate or corresponding  swap rate
of the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

      The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30, 2006, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares  exceeded
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of all outstanding Preferred
Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

                           THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2006,  the Fund  paid  brokerage
commissions  of $15,135 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli &  Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

      The  cost of  calculating  the  Fund's  NAV per  share  is a Fund  expense
pursuant to the Advisory  Agreement.  During the six months ended June 30, 2006,
the Fund paid or accrued  $22,500 to the Adviser in connection  with the cost of
computing  the Fund's NAV,  which is included in  miscellaneous  expenses in the
Statement of Operations.

      The Fund is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds' Chief Compliance Officer in the amount of $2,978 for the six months ended
June 30,  2006,  which is  included  in payroll  expenses  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the six months ended June 30, 2006, other than short-term securities, aggregated
$25,983,309 and $13,452,733, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The Fund is  authorized  to issue an unlimited  number of shares of
beneficial interest (par value $0.001).  The Board has authorized the repurchase
of its shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a discount of
10% or more (or such other  percentage as the Board may  determine  from time to
time) from the NAV of the shares. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the

</TABLE>

      The Fund is authorized to issue up to 2,005,000 shares of $0.001 par value
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  The Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the
common shares and results in the financial leveraging of the common shares. Such
leveraging  tends  to  magnify  both  the  risks  and  opportunities  to  common
shareholders.  Dividends  on  shares  of  the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  are
cumulative.  The  Fund  is  required  by  the  1940  Act  and  by  the  Articles
Supplementary  to  meet  certain  asset  coverage  tests  with  respect  to  the
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. If the Fund fails to meet these  requirements  and
does not correct such failure, the Fund may be required to redeem, in part or in
full, the 5.625% Series A and Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
at a  redemption  price of $25.00 and $25,000,  respectively,  per share plus an
amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid dividends  whether or not declared on
such shares in order to meet these requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet
the foregoing asset coverage  requirements  could restrict the Fund's ability to
pay  dividends  to  common  shareholders  and could  lead to sales of  portfolio
securities at inopportune  times.  The income  received on the Fund's assets may
vary in a manner  unrelated  to the fixed and variable  rates,  which could have
either a beneficial or  detrimental  impact on net  investment  income and gains
available to common shareholders.

      On July 31, 2003,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $28,877,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $945,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public  offering of 1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Commencing  July 31, 2008 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option,  may
redeem the 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30,  2006,  the
Fund did not  repurchase  any  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. All repurchased shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock have
been retired.  At June 30, 2006,  1,184,200 shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $23,129.

                           THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
             NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      On July 31, 2003,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $24,572,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $250,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public  offering of 1,000 shares of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates.  The dividend
rates of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from 4.00% to
5.21% for the six months ended June 30, 2006.  Existing  shareholders may submit
an order to hold,  bid,  or sell such  shares  on each  auction  date.  Series B
Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock  shareholders  may also trade shares in
the secondary market.  The Fund, at its option,  may redeem the Series B Auction
Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at
any time. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Fund did not redeem any
shares of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At June 30, 2006,
1,000  shares  of  Series  B  Auction  Rate  Cumulative   Preferred  Stock  were
outstanding  with an  annualized  dividend  rate of 5.21% per share and  accrued
dividends amounted to $10,854.

      The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class.  The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain  circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Directors.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6. INDUSTRY  CONCENTRATION.  Because the Fund primarily invests in common stocks
and other securities of foreign and domestic  companies in the utility industry,
its  portfolio  may be subject to greater  risk and market  fluctuations  than a
portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund trading  practices  involving  certain funds managed by the Adviser.
GAMCO Investors,  Inc. ("GAMCO"), the Adviser's parent company, is responding to
these  requests  for  documents  and  testimony.   In  June  2006,  GAMCO  began
discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry. Since
these discussions are ongoing, it cannot be determined at this time whether they
will ultimately  result in a settlement of this matter. On a separate matter, in
September  2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the SEC that the staff
may recommend to the  Commission  that an  administrative  remedy and a monetary
penalty be sought  from the  Adviser in  connection  with the  actions of two of
seven closed-end funds managed by the Adviser relating to Section 19(a) and Rule
19a-1 of the 1940 Act. These provisions require registered  investment companies
to provide  written  statements to  shareholders  when a dividend is made from a
source other than net investment  income.  While the two  closed-end  funds sent
annual statements and provided other materials containing this information,  the
funds did not send written  statements to shareholders with each distribution in
2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that all of the funds are now in compliance.
The Adviser  believes that these matters would have no effect on the Fund or any
material adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the Fund.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

At its meeting on February 15, 2006, the Board of Trustees ("Board") of the Fund
approved the continuation of the investment  advisory agreement with the Adviser
for the Fund on the  basis of the  recommendation  by the  trustees  who are not
"interested  persons"  of  the  Fund  (the  "independent  board  members").  The
following  paragraphs  summarize the material information and factors considered
by the independent board members as well as their  conclusions  relative to such
factors.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The independent board members considered
information  regarding  the  portfolio  manager,  the depth of the analyst  pool
available to the Adviser and the portfolio manager, the scope of administrative,
shareholder,  and other services supervised or provided by the Adviser,  and the
absence of significant  service problems  reported to the Board. The independent
board members noted the  experience,  length of service,  and  reputation of the
portfolio manager.

INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  The  independent  board  members  reviewed  the short,
medium,  and  long-term  performance  of the Fund against a peer group of equity
closed-end  funds  between $20 million  and $2,000  million  chosen by Lipper as
being   comparable.   The  independent  board  members  noted  that  the  Fund's
performance  was in the second  quartile  of the funds in its  category  for the
prior one and five year  periods  but was in the third  quartile of the funds in
its category for the three year period.

PROFITABILITY. The independent board members reviewed summary data regarding the
profitability  of the Fund to the Adviser both with an  administrative  overhead
charge and without such a charge.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The independent  board members  discussed the major elements
of the  Adviser's  cost  structure  and the  relationship  of those  elements to
potential  economies of scale. The independent board members noted that the Fund
was a closed-end fund and unlikely to realize any economies of scale.

SHARING OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The  independent  board  members  noted that the
investment  advisory  fee  schedule  for the Fund does not take into account any
potential economies of scale.

SERVICE AND COST COMPARISONS. The independent board members compared the expense
ratios of the investment advisory fee, other expenses, and total expenses of the
Fund to similar expense ratios of the peer group of equity  closed-end funds and
noted that the advisory fee includes  substantially all administrative  services
of the  Fund  as  well as  investment  advisory  services  of the  Adviser.  The
independent  board members noted that the Fund's  expense  ratios were above and
the Fund's  size was below  average  within this group.  The  independent  board
members  also  noted that the  advisory  fee  structure  was the same as that in
effect for most of the Gabelli  funds,  except for the  presence of leverage and
fees chargeable on assets attributable to leverage in certain circumstances. The
independent  board  members  were  presented  with,  but did not  consider to be
material to their decision,  various information  comparing the advisory fee for
other types of accounts managed by affiliates of the Adviser.

CONCLUSIONS.  The  independent  board  members  concluded  that the Fund enjoyed
highly experienced portfolio management services and good ancillary services and
that the performance  record was  satisfactory.  The  independent  board members
concluded  that  the  profitability  to the  Adviser  of  managing  the Fund was
reasonable  and that,  in part due to the  structure of the Fund as a closed-end
fund,  economies of scale were not a significant  factor in their thinking.  The
independent board members did not view the potential  profitability of ancillary
services  as  material  to their  decision.  On the basis of the  foregoing  and
without assigning  particular weight to any single  conclusion,  the independent
board members  determined to recommend  continuation of the investment  advisory
agreement to the full Board.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli   Utility   Trust  (the  "Fund")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to issue  common  shares to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a capital
gains distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading at a discount or
a premium to net asset value. All distributions to shareholders whose shares are
registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested  pursuant to the
Plan in additional  shares of the Fund. Plan  participants  may send their share
certificates to Computershare Trust Company,  N.A.  ("Computershare") to be held
in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.  Registered  shareholders  wishing to
receive their distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                           The Gabelli Utility Trust
                               c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

      If your shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of common shares  distributed  to  participants  in the Plan in
lieu of cash  dividends is determined in the following  manner.  Under the Plan,
whenever the market price of the Fund's common shares is equal to or exceeds net
asset value at the time shares are valued for purposes of determining the number
of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends  or  capital  gains  distribution,
participants are issued common shares valued at the greater of (i) the net asset
value as most recently  determined or (ii) 95% of the then current  market price
of the Fund's common shares.  The valuation date is the dividend or distribution
payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE") trading
day, the next  trading  day. If the net asset value of the common  shares at the
time of valuation  exceeds the market price of the common  shares,  participants
will receive  common  shares from the Fund valued at market  price.  If the Fund
should  declare a dividend or capital gains  distribution  payable only in cash,
Computershare  will buy  common  shares  in the open  market,  or on the NYSE or
elsewhere,  for the  participants'  accounts,  except  that  Computershare  will
endeavor to  terminate  purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue
shares at net asset value if, following the commencement of such purchases,  the
market value of the common shares exceeds the then current net asset value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase their  investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's common
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

      SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Fund.

      The Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate  the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.
