    1. ORGANIZATION

       UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.  (formerly,  UBS PW M2 Fund, L.L.C.) (the "Fund") was
       organized as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware on
       September 4, 2002. The Fund is registered  under the  Investment  Company
       Act  of  1940,   as  amended   (the  "1940   Act"),   as  a   closed-end,
       non-diversified,  management  investment  company.  The Fund's investment
       objective is to seek capital appreciation over the long term. The Fund is
       a multi-manager fund that seeks to achieve its objective by deploying its
       assets among a select group of portfolio  managers who  primarily  employ
       long/short equity strategies,  including those involving foreign issuers.
       Generally,  such portfolio  managers  conduct their  investment  programs
       through  unregistered  investment  funds  (collectively,  the "Investment
       Funds"),  in which  the Fund  invests  as a  limited  partner,  member or
       shareholder along with other investors.  The Fund commenced operations on
       February 1, 2003.

       The  Fund's   Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has   overall
       responsibility  to manage and control the  business  affairs of the Fund,
       including  the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies
       regarding the management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.
       The Directors have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (formerly,  PW Fund
       Advisor,  L.L.C.)  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser" and, when providing  services
       under the  Administration  Agreement,  the  "Administrator")  a  Delaware
       limited  liability  company,  to provide  investment advice regarding the
       selection of Investment  Funds and the  responsibility  of the day-to-day
       management of the Fund.

       The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc.,
       which is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG. The Adviser is
       registered  as an adviser under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as
       amended.

       Initial and additional  applications for interests by eligible  investors
       may be  accepted  at such  times as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
       generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves the right to reject any
       application for interests in the Fund.

       The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests pursuant to
       written tenders to Members.  These repurchases will be made at such times
       and on  such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Directors,  in  their
       complete  and  exclusive  discretion.  The Adviser  expects  that it will
       recommend to the Directors  that the Fund offer to  repurchase  interests
       from Members in March 2004 and December 2004 and, thereafter,  twice each
       year,  near  mid-year and  year-end.  Members can only transfer or assign
       their membership interests (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,
       bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a  Member,  or (ii) with the
       written  approval of the  Directors,  which may be withheld in their sole
       and absolute discretion.

    2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

       Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the direction of the

                                                                               5

    2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


       A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

       determined  from time to time  pursuant  to policies  established  by the
       Directors.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the
       terms and conditions of the respective  operating agreements and offering
       memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
       carried at fair value as  determined by the Fund's  pro-rata  interest in
       the net assets of each Investment Fund. All valuations  utilize financial
       information  supplied by each  Investment  Fund and are net of management
       and performance  incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment
       Funds'  managers or pursuant to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The
       underlying  investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair
       value as described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.

       Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment Funds,  whether in
       the form of cash or  securities,  are first applied as a reduction of the
       investment's cost.

       B. INCOME RECOGNITION

       Interest  income is  recorded on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
       losses from Investment Fund transactions are calculated on the identified
       cost basis.

       C. FUND COSTS

       The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including, but not
       limited to, the  following:  all costs and expenses  related to portfolio
       transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting
       and auditing  fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing  the Fund's net
       asset  value;  costs  of  insurance;   registration   expenses;   certain
       organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related expenses;
       expenses of meetings of Directors and Members;  all costs with respect to
       communications  to Members;  and other types of expenses  approved by the
       Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

       D. INCOME TAXES

       No provision for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
       been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member
       is individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive
       share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

       E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

       Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank, NA
       account  which pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
       accrued  interest,  which  is  included  in  interest  receivable  on the
       Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

                                                                               6

    2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

       F. USE OF ESTIMATES

       The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with  accounting
       principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America  requires
       the Adviser to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
       reported in the financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser
       believes  that the estimates  utilized in preparing the Fund's  financial
       statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
       differ from these estimates.

    3. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATOR FEE AND RELATED PARTY
       TRANSACTIONS

       The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
       an Investment  Manager  Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement,  the Fund
       pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee") at the
       annual  rate  of  1.45%  of  the  Fund's  net  assets,  excluding  assets
       attributable  to the Adviser  and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator
       provides certain  administrative  services to the Fund, including,  among
       other  things,  providing  office space and other  support  services.  In
       consideration  for such  services,  the Fund  pays  the  Administrator  a
       monthly fee (the  "Administrator  Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the
       Fund's net assets,  excluding assets  attributable to the Administrator's
       and  the  Adviser's  capital  account.  The  Administrator  Fee  and  the
       Investment  Management Fee will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the
       Fund's  assets  and  debited  against  the  Members'  capital   accounts,
       excluding net assets  attributable to the  Administrator  and the Adviser
       capital  account.  A portion  of the  Investment  Management  Fee and the
       Administrator Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

       UBS Financial  Services,  Inc.  (formerly,  UBS PaineWebber,  Inc.) ("UBS
       FSI"),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,  acts  as a
       placement agent for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund,
       and will bear its own costs  associated  with its activities as placement
       agent.  Placement  fees,  if any,  charged on  contributions  are debited
       against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount.
       The placement fee does not constitute assets of the Fund.

       The  net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  Members'   capital  derived  from
       operations  (net income or loss) is  initially  allocated  to the capital
       accounts of all Members on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the  Investment
       Management Fee and the Administrator Fee which are similarly allocated to
       all Members' other than the Adviser as described above.

       The  Adviser  has   voluntarily   undertaken  to  bear  certain   initial
       organization  and offering  expense  otherwise  borne by the Fund and its
       Members  during  the  Funds'  first  twelve  months  of  operations.  The
       Adviser's  undertaking  provides  that  Members  will  not  bear  initial
       organization  and offering  expenses in excess of 0.25% of total  Members
       capital as a result of the Fund's start-up.

       Organization  costs  are  expensed  and  offering  costs are  charged  to
       Members' capital as incurred based on the undertaking provided above.

                                                                               7

    3. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATOR FEE AND RELATED PARTY
       TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

       In order to achieve a more equitable  distribution of the impact of these
       costs,  the Fund has either  credited to or debited  against the Members'
       capital  accounts the sum of such initial costs based on each  individual
       Member's  percentage of capital in the Fund.  The  reallocation  of these
       costs will occur for the first twelve  months  after the initial  closing
       date of the Fund.

       Each Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined
       by the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $5,000 plus a fee for
       each meeting  attended.  Any Director who is an "interested  person" does
       not  receive  any annual or other fee from the Fund.  All  Directors  are
       reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
       amounts  expensed  related to  Directors by the Fund for the period ended
       June 30, 2003 were $8,750.

       PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as the custodian
       of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund.

       PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as Accounting  and
       Investor  Servicing  Agent  to the  Fund  and in that  capacity  provides
       certain  administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  Member
       related  services.  PFPC Inc. receives a monthly fee primarily based upon
       (i) the average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum  monthly fee,
       and  (ii)  the  aggregate  net  assets  of the  Fund  and  certain  other
       investment  funds  sponsored  or advised  by UBS  Americas,  Inc.  or its
       affiliates.  Additionally,  the Fund  reimburses  certain  out of  pocket
       expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

    4. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

       Aggregate  purchases  of  Investment  Funds for the period ended June 30,
       2003, amounted to $123,000,000.

       The cost of  investments  for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
       items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds.
       The allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment
       Funds on Schedules K-1.
