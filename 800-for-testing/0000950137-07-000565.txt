VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based
statistical composite of Pennsylvania municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged
and does not include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower
performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

Against the backdrop of strong economic growth, good employment data and
inflationary pressures stemming from rising oil prices, the Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") continued its tightening campaign during the first eight
months of the reporting period, raising the federal funds target rate six times
to 5.25 percent at the end of June. As the months progressed however, economic
growth moderated as consumer spending and housing weakened while inflation
concerns eased, prompting investors to speculate that the Fed would take a break
from rate increases. In August the Fed did pause, ending a two-year run of 17
consecutive rate increases--the longest stretch of increases in 25 years. At its
subsequent meetings, the Fed again kept its target rate unchanged, and indicated
that any future rate increases would be driven by the weight of economic data.

As a result of the improved outlook for the fixed-income market, yields on
longer-maturity municipal bonds fell dramatically in latter months of the
reporting year, ultimately ending at the lowest level in decades and causing
this segment of the market to earn the best returns. Shorter-maturity municipal
bonds, however, posted the lowest returns as Fed rate hikes moved yields in this
portion of the curve higher. Accordingly, the slope of the municipal yield curve
flattened as the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates
narrowed.

Demand for municipal bonds continued to be strong during the period. In fact,
inflows into municipal bond funds were 55 percent higher year-to-date through
October than for the same period last year, much of which went into high-yield
funds. Because prevailing interest rates were still at relatively low levels,
investors increasingly sought out lower-quality, higher-yielding bonds. The
increased demand for high-yield bonds led this segment of the market to
considerably outperform high-grade issues.

Although municipal bond issuance remained brisk in the last quarter of 2005,
volume declined throughout the remaining months of the period. As of the end of
October, national municipal bond issuance was down 13 percent for 2006. The
reduced supply, coupled with growing demand, further fueled municipal bond
performance.

Consistent with the national trend, municipal bond issuance by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania declined for the overall period. The education sector continued
to be the state's largest issuer of debt. There are more than 600 school
districts in the state, as well as several colleges and universities, all of
which continue to issue new debt. Pennsylvania's economy continued to improve,
with better than anticipated job and income growth, strong growth in personal
income tax revenues, and declining unemployment.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis, the trust outperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman
Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index. On a market price basis the trust
underperformed its benchmark.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

Throughout the reporting period, we sought opportunities to enhance the
portfolio's yield, while still adhering to our quality-driven investment
discipline. We did so primarily by implementing two general strategies. First,
we increased the portfolio's exposure to lower-rated, higher-yielding
securities. Specifically, we added to holdings in BBB rated credits while
reducing holdings in AAA rated credits. This strategy proved beneficial to
performance as credit spreads in the high-yield segment of the market tightened,
leading high-yield bonds to considerably outperform high-grade bonds. Second, we
emphasized the long end of the yield curve, favoring bonds with maturities of 25
to 30 years or more. Given the flattening of the yield curve during the period,
attractive yields were primarily found on the very long end of the curve and our
focus here was additive to performance.

Reflecting our view that interest rates in the Treasury market would continue to
rise, we kept the trust's duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity)
shorter than that of the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index for
much of the period. In the latter months, when it appeared that the Fed was done
raising rates, we increased the trust's duration to a more neutral stance. While
this positioning overall was beneficial, the trust could have benefited even
more had we increased the duration earlier in the reporting period. In addition,
rising interest rates made the trust's borrowing activity more expensive,
thereby tempering the benefits of leverage for much of the period. The trust
uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The trust borrows

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred shares. The proceeds
are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage of the difference
between short- and longer-term rates.

In keeping with our focus on high-yielding credits, we increased the trust's
holdings of Puerto Rico tobacco revenue bonds, which are BBB rated and triple
tax-exempt. The litigation environment for tobacco companies has become quite
favorable, demand for the bonds remains strong, and the industry continues to
prosper. We also added to holdings in health care bonds, which have benefited
from spread tightening in the sector, and increased exposure to higher education
bonds. Our decision to increase the trust's exposure to these sectors during the
period was additive to performance as they performed strongly.

The trust remained well represented among the major sectors of the municipal
market. The largest sectors at the end of the period were higher education,
general purpose, hospital and public education.

The Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when appropriate,
repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is lower at the time of
purchase. This may help support the market value of the trust's shares.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

The Board of Trustees of the trust recently approved the following non-
fundamental investment policy for the trust: The trust may invest up to 20% of
its assets in securities that are rated, at the time of investment, BB/Ba or B
by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("S&P"), Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
("Moody's") or Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") or that are unrated, but deemed to
be of comparable quality by the Adviser. These securities are regarded as below
investment grade and are commonly referred to as junk bonds, and involve greater
risks than investments in higher-grade securities.

Securities that are in the lower-grade categories generally offer higher yields
than are offered by higher-grade securities of similar maturities, but they also
generally involve greater risks, such as greater credit risk, greater market
risk and volatility, greater liquidity concerns and potentially greater manager
risk. Rated lower-grade debt securities are regarded by S&P, Moody's and Fitch
as predominately speculative with respect to the capacity to pay interest or
repay principal or interest in accordance with their terms. Investors should
carefully consider the risks of owning shares of a trust which invests in
lower-grade securities before investing in the trust.

Lower-grade securities are more susceptible to nonpayment of interest and
principal or default than higher-grade securities. Increases in interest rates
or
 4
<PAGE>

changes in the economy may significantly affect the ability of lower-grade
income securities to pay interest and to repay principal, to meet projected
financial goals or to obtain additional financing. In the event that an issuer
of securities held by the trust experiences difficulties in the timely payment
of principal and interest and such issuer seeks to restructure the terms of its
borrowings, the trust may incur additional expenses and may determine to invest
additional assets with respect to such issuer or the project or projects to
which the trust's securities relate. Further, the trust may incur additional
expenses to the extent that it is required to seek recovery upon a default in
the payment of interest or the repayment of principal on its portfolio holdings,
and the trust may be unable to obtain full recovery on such amounts.

The secondary market prices of lower-grade securities generally are less
sensitive to changes in interest rates and are more sensitive to real or
perceived general adverse economic changes or specific developments with respect
to the particular issuers than are the secondary market prices of higher-grade
securities. A significant increase in interest rates or a general economic
downturn could severely disrupt the market for lower-grade securities and
adversely affect the market value of such securities. Such events also could
lead to a higher incidence of default by issuers of lower-grade securities as
compared with higher-grade securities. In addition, changes in credit risks,
interest rates, the credit markets or periods of general economic uncertainty
can be expected to result in increased volatility in the market price of
lower-grade securities in the trust and thus in the net asset value of the
trust. Adverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on
rational analysis, may affect the value, volatility and liquidity of lower-grade
securities.

The markets for lower-grade securities may be less liquid than the markets for
higher-grade securities. To the extent that there is no established retail
market for some of the lower-grade securities in which the trust may invest,
trading in such securities may be relatively inactive. Prices of lower-grade
securities may decline rapidly in the event a significant number of holders
decide to sell. Changes in expectations regarding an individual issuer of
lower-grade securities generally could reduce market liquidity for such
securities and make their sale by the trust more difficult, at least in the
absence of price concessions. The effects of adverse publicity and investor
perceptions may be more pronounced for securities for which no established
retail market exists as compared with the effects on securities for which such a
market does exist. An economic downturn or an increase in interest rates could
severely disrupt the market for such securities and adversely affect the value
of outstanding securities or the ability of the issuers to repay principal and
interest. Further, the trust may have more difficulty selling such securities in
a timely manner and at their stated value than would be the case for securities
for which an established retail market does exist.

The market for lower grade securities may have less available information,
further complicating evaluations and valuations of such securities and placing

                                                                               5

more emphasis on the Adviser's experience, judgment and analysis than other

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 22, 2006, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. Finally, the Board considered materials it had received in
approving a reorganization of the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the
contract over a period of several months and the non-management trustees held
sessions both with the investment adviser and separate from the investment
adviser in reviewing and considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of factors
control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all factors

 8
<PAGE>

together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio
management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated
expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that
the analysis of the

                                                                               9

investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2006

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to seek to provide a high level of current income exempt
from federal and Pennsylvania income taxes and, where possible under local law,
local income and personal property taxes, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania
municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of investment, but may
invest up to 20% of its assets in unrated securities which are believed to be of
comparable quality to those rated investment grade. The Trust commenced
investment operations on April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day on the
exchange on which they are traded. Interest rate swaps are valued using market
quotations from brokers. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At October 31, 2006, the Trust had no when-issued or delayed
delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

                                                                              25

    At October 31, 2006, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred
shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may
include short-term capital gains and a portion of futures gains, which are
included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
2006 and 2005, was as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
                                                                 2006           2005

Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................  $   294,810    $       --
  Tax-exempt income.........................................   23,223,650     4,869,836
  Long-term capital gain....................................    1,103,706       330,312
                                                              -----------    ----------
                                                              $24,622,166    $5,200,148
                                                              ===========    ==========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Permanent book and tax
differences related to excise taxes and merger costs which are not deductible
for tax purposes totaling $7,502 and $340,753, respectively, have been
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to paid in
surplus. Additionally, a permanent difference relating to book to tax accretion
differences totaling $12,003 was reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to accumulated net realized gain.

    As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                             <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................    $114,587
Undistributed tax-exempt income.............................     390,577
Undistributed long-term capital gain........................     162,938
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of gains or losses recognized on securities for
tax purposes but not for book and gains and losses recognized for tax purposes
on open futures transactions on October 31, 2006.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2006 continued

F. FLOATING RATE NOTE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SECURITIES HELD The Trust enters
into transactions in which it transfers to dealer trusts fixed rate bonds in
exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trusts' assets and cash
flows, which are in the form of inverse floating rate investments. The dealer
trusts fund the purchases of the fixed rate bonds by issuing floating rate notes
to third parties and allowing the Trust to retain residual interests in the
bonds. The Trust enters into shortfall agreements with the dealer trusts, which
commit the Trust to pay the dealer trusts, in certain circumstances, the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed rate bonds held by the
dealer trusts and the liquidation value of the floating rate notes held by third
parties, as well as any shortfalls in interest cash flows. The residual
interests held by the Trust (inverse floating rate investments) include the
right of the Trust (1) to cause the holders of the floating rate notes to tender
their notes at par at the next interest rate reset date, and (2) to transfer the
municipal bond from the dealer trusts to the Trust, thereby collapsing the
dealer trusts. The Trust accounts for the transfer of bonds to the dealer trusts
as secured borrowings, with the securities transferred remaining in the Trust's
investment assets, and the related floating rate notes reflected as Trust
liabilities under the caption "Floating Rate Note Obligations" on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust records the interest income from the fixed
rate bonds under the caption "Interest" and records the expenses related to
floating rate note obligations and any administrative expenses of the dealer
trusts under the caption "Interest and Residual Trust Expenses" in the Trust's
Statement of Operations. The notes issued by the dealer trusts have interest
rates that reset weekly and the floating rate note holders have the option to
tender their notes to the dealer trusts for redemption at par at each reset
date. At October 31, 2006, Trust investments with a value of $24,674,999 are

result of credits earned on cash balances.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
including preferred shares of the Trust. Effective December 1, 2006, the Adviser
has agreed to waive investment advisory fees equal to .10% of the average daily
net assets including preferred shares of the Trust. This waiver is voluntary and
can be discontinued at any time.

    For the year ended October 31, 2006, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $27,700 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such

    On December 2, 2005, the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
the Van Kampen Advantage Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol
VAP), Pennsylvania Quality Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol VPQ) and Trust
for Investment Grade Pennsylvania Municipals (ticker symbol VTP) through a tax
free reorganization approved by VAP, VPQ and VTP shareholders on November 22,
2005. The Trust issued 20,131,138 common shares with a net asset value of
$317,870,416 and 7,000 Auction Preferred Shares (APS) with a liquidation value
of $175,000,000 in exchange for VAP's, VPQ's, and VTP's net assets. The shares
of VAP were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of 1.005624 to 1 and 1 to 1,
for common shares and APS, respectively. The shares of VPQ were converted into
Trust shares at a ratio of 1.002660 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS,
respectively. The shares of VTP were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
1.002103 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. Net
unrealized appreciation of VAP, VPQ and VTP as of December 2, 2005 was
$22,548,134. The Trust assumed VAP's, VPQ's, and VTP's book to tax accretion
differences, which resulted in a $409,362 increase to accumulated undistributed
net investment income and a corresponding decrease to net unrealized
appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to common shares on the day of
reorganization were $388,563,174 and combined net assets including preferred
shares were $608,563,174. Included in these net assets was a deferred
compensation and retirement plan balance of $770,770 which is included with
accumulated undistributed net investment income. Additionally, included in these
net assets were gains or losses of $181,794 recognized

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2006 continued

for tax purposes on open futures transactions at December 2, 2005, which are
included with accumulated net realized gain. The Trust incurred merger expenses
of $340,753, which represent costs related to the preparation, printing, and
distribution of the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, Reorganization Agreement and
registration statements as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $128,424,431 and $107,513,362,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or
fixed-income market changes, for duration management or for risk management
purposes, but may also enter into these transactions to generate additional
income. All of the Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments,
are marked to market each day with the change in value reflected in the
unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Upon disposition, a realized gain or loss
is recognized accordingly, except when taking delivery of a security underlying
a futures contract. In this instance, the recognition of gain or loss is
postponed until the disposal of the security underlying the futures contract.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in exchange traded futures contracts on U.S. Treasury
securities and typically closes the contract prior to the delivery date. These
contracts are generally used to manage the Trust's effective maturity and
duration. Upon entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of
cash or liquid securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract
amount with either a futures commission merchant pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, as amended, or with its custodian in
an account in the broker's name. This amount is known as initial margin. During
the period the futures contract is open, payments are received from or made to
the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the variation
margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in excess of the
variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

                                                                              29

</Table>

B. INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Trust may enter into forward interest rate swap
transactions intended to help the Trust manage its overall interest rate
sensitivity, either shorter or longer, generally to more closely align the
Trust's interest rate sensitivity with that of the broader municipal market.
Forward interest rate swap transactions involve the Trust's agreement with a
counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or variable rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty paying the Trust a variable or fixed rate payment, the
accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the future (the "effective
date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional amount of
the forward swap contract and the termination date of the swap (which is akin to
a bond's maturity). The value of the Trust's swap commitment would increase or
decrease based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swap's termination date increases or decreases.
The Trust may terminate a swap contract prior to the effective date, at which
point a realized gain or loss is recognized. When a forward swap is terminated,
it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying
assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis. The Trust
intends, but is not obligated, to terminate its forward swaps before the
effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap
counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with
a counterparty failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the
Trust upon termination. To reduce such credit risk, all counterparties are
required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap)
on behalf of the Trust with a value approximately equal to the amount of any
unrealized gain. Reciprocally, when the Trust has an unrealized loss on a swap
contract, the Trust has instructed the custodian to pledge cash or liquid
securities as collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the
unrealized loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if
and when the swap valuations fluctuate. Restricted cash, if any, for segregating
purposes is shown on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

C. INVERSE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS The Trust may invest a portion of its
assets in inverse floating rate instruments, either through outright purchases
of inverse floating rate securities or through the transfer of bonds to a dealer
trust in exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trust. These
investments are typically used by the Trust in seeking to enhance the yield of
the portfolio. These instruments typically involve greater risks than a fixed
rate municipal bond. In particular, these instruments are acquired through
leverage or may have leverage embedded in them and therefore involve many of the
risks associated with leverage. Leverage is a speculative technique that may
expose the Trust to greater risk and increased costs. Leverage may cause the
Trust's net asset value to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged
because leverage tends to magnify the effect of any increases or decreases in
the value of the Trust's portfolio securities. The use of leverage may also
cause the Trust to

 30
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2006 continued

liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in order
to satisfy its obligations with respect to inverse floating rate instruments.

6. PREFERRED SHARES

As of October 31, 2006, the Trust has outstanding 8,800 APS. Series A contains
1,800 shares, Series B contains 1,600 shares, Series C contains 2,600 shares,
and Series D contains 2,800 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend
rates are generally reset every 7 days for Series A, while Series B, Series C,
and Series D are generally reset every 28 days through an auction process. The
average rate in effect on October 31, 2006 was 3.572%. During the year ended
October 31, 2006, the rates ranged from 2.600% to 5.250%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

8. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation
of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before
being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact to the Trust's financial
statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

                                                                              31

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the
portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2006, the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of October 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust as of October 31, 2006, the
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The dividend reinvestment plan offers you a prompt and simple way to
reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions into additional shares
of your trust. Under the plan, the money you earn from dividends and capital
gains distributions will be reinvested automatically in more shares of your
trust, allowing you to potentially increase your investment over time.

PLAN BENEFITS

    - ADD TO YOUR ACCOUNT

      You may increase your shares in your trust easily and automatically with
      the dividend reinvestment plan.

    - LOW TRANSACTION COSTS

      Shareholders who participate in the plan are able to buy shares at below-
      market prices when the trust is trading at a premium to its net asset
      value. In addition, transaction costs are low because when new shares are
      issued by the trust, there is no brokerage fee, and when shares are bought
      in blocks on the open market, the brokerage commission is shared among all
      participants.

    - CONVENIENCE

      You will receive a detailed account statement from Computershare Trust
      Company, N.A., which administers the plan, whenever shares are reinvested
      for you. The statement shows your total distributions, date of investment,
      shares acquired, and price per share, as well as the total number of
      shares in your reinvestment account.

    - SAFEKEEPING

      Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will hold the shares it has acquired for
      you in safekeeping, which provides added protection against loss, theft,
      or inadvertent destruction of certificates. However, you may request that
      a certificate representing your reinvested shares be issued to you.

HOW DOES THE PLAN WORK?

    If you choose to participate in the plan, your dividends and capital gains
distributions will be promptly reinvested for you, automatically increasing your
shares. If your trust is trading at a share price that is equal to its net asset
value (NAV), you'll pay that amount for your reinvested shares. However, if your
trust is trading above or below its NAV, the price is determined by one of two
ways:

       1. PREMIUM If your trust is trading at a premium -- a market price that
       is higher than its NAV -- you'll pay either the NAV or 95 percent of the
       market price, whichever is greater. When your trust trades at a premium,
       you'll pay less for your reinvested shares than an ordinary investor
       purchasing shares on the stock exchange. Keep in mind, a portion of your
       price reduction may be taxable because you are receiving shares at less
       than market price.

                                                                              33
<PAGE>
VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

       2. DISCOUNT If your trust is trading at a discount -- a market price that
       is lower than its NAV -- you'll pay the market price for your reinvested
       shares.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN

    If you own shares in your own name, you can participate directly in the
plan. If your shares are held in "street name" -- in the name of your brokerage
firm, bank, or other financial institution -- you must instruct that entity to
participate on your behalf. If they are unable to participate on your behalf,
you may request that they reregister your shares in your own name so that you
may enroll in the plan.

    If you choose to participate in the plan, whenever your trust declares a
dividend or capital gains distribution, it will be invested in additional shares
of your trust that are purchased on the open market.

HOW TO ENROLL

    To enroll in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan please visit vankampen.com or
call (800) 341-2929 or notify us in writing at the address below.

Please include your trust name and account number and ensure that all
shareholders listed on the account sign these written instructions. Your
participation in the plan will begin with the next dividend or capital gains
distribution payable after Computershare Trust Company, N.A. receives your
authorization, as long as they receive it before the "record date," which is
generally ten business days before the dividend is paid. If your authorization
arrives after such record date, your participation in the plan will begin with
the following dividend or distribution.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    There is no direct charge to you for reinvesting dividends and capital gains
distributions because the plan's fees are paid by your trust. If your trust is
trading at or above its NAV, your new shares are issued directly by the trust
and there are no brokerage charges or commissions. However, if your trust is
trading at a discount, the shares are purchased on the open market, and you will
pay your portion of any brokerage commissions. These brokerage commissions are
typically less than the standard brokerage charges for individual transactions
because shares are purchased for all participants in

 34
<PAGE>
VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

blocks, resulting in lower commissions for each individual participant. Any
brokerage commissions or service fees are averaged into the purchase price.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    The automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions does
not relieve you of any income tax that may be due on dividends or distributions.
You will receive tax information annually to help you prepare your federal and
state income tax returns.

HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PLAN

    To withdraw from the Dividend Reinvestment Plan please visit vankampen.com
or call (800) 341-2929 or notify us in writing at the address below.

                             Providence, RI 02940-3011
All shareholders listed on the account must sign any written withdrawal
instructions. If you withdraw, you have two choices for receiving your shares:

    - CERTIFICATE

    We will issue a certificate for the full shares and send you a check for any
fractional shares without a charge.

    - CHECK

    We will sell all full and fractional shares and send the proceeds to your
address of record after deducting brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

    The Trust and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. may amend or terminate the
plan. Participants will receive written notice at least 30 days before the
effective date of any amendment. In the case of termination, participants will
receive written notice at least 30 days before the record date for the payment
of any dividend or capital gains distribution by your trust.

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1.   STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

2.   DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.   AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4.   AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.   TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.   ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.   PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.   PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.  COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Asset Management

     -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Trust has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are: R.
Craig Kennedy, Jerry Choate and Rod Dammeyer.

(b) Not applicable.

Item 6. Schedule of Investments.

Please refer to Item #1.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust invests in exclusively non-voting securities and therefore this item
is not applicable to the Trust.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

     VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST (VPV) (THE "FUND")

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Fund is managed by
members of the Municipal Fixed Income team. The team consists of portfolio
managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio and the
overall execution of the strategy of the Fund are Dennis P. Pietrzak, an
Executive Director of the Adviser, Robert W. Wimmel, a Vice President of the
Adviser and John Reynoldson, an Executive Director of the Adviser.

Mr. Pietrzak has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since August 1995 and began managing the Fund in August 1995. Mr.
Wimmel has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management capacity
since August 1996 and began managing the Fund in November 2001. Mr. Reynoldson
has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management capacity since
April 1987 and began managing the Fund in November 2001.

The composition of the team may change from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

As of October 31, 2006:

Mr. Pietrzak managed eight registered investment companies with a total of
approximately $2.7 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
registered investment companies; and no other accounts.

<PAGE>

Mr. Wimmel managed 25 registered investment companies with a total of
approximately $12.6 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
registered investment companies; and no other accounts.

Mr. Reynoldson managed 19 registered investment companies with a total of
approximately $7.7 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
registered investment companies; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio manager may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. The portfolio managers of the Fund do not currently manage assets of other
investment companies, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts that charge a
performance fee. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies and
procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and other
conflicts of interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

Base salary compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

- -    Cash Bonus.

- -    Morgan Stanley's Equity Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation into restricted stock units or other awards based on Morgan
     Stanley common stock that are subject to vesting and other conditions.

- -    Investment Management Alignment Plan (IMAP) awards -- a mandatory program
     that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation and notionally
     invests it in designated Funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates.
     The award is subject to vesting and other conditions. Portfolio managers
     must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 100% of the IMAP
     deferral into a combination of the designated open-end mutual funds they
     manage that are included in the IMAP Fund menu, which may or may not
     include the Fund.

- -    Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
     certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary
     year-end compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred
     amount: (1) across a range of designated investment Funds, including Funds
     advised by the Adviser or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley
     stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- -    Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
     pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the
     portfolio manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three-
     and five-year periods measured against a fund's/account's primary
     benchmark, indices and/or peer groups where applicable. Generally, the
     greatest weight is placed on the three- and five-year periods.

SECURITIES OWNERSHIP OF PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

As of October 31, 2006, the portfolio managers did not own any shares of the
Fund.

Item 9. Purchase of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management Investment
Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

Not Applicable.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not Applicable.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures

a) The Trust's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
Trust in this Form N-CSR was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC")
rules and forms or by the SEC staff, based upon such officers' evaluation of
these controls and procedures as of January 12, which is a date within 90 days
of the filing date of the report. The Trust's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have also concluded that the Trust's disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Trust in this Form N-CSR is accumulated and communicated to the
Trust's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure were effective.

Management of the Trust has determined that as of and prior to October 31, 2006,
the Trust's fiscal year end, the Trust had a deficiency in its internal control
over financial reporting related to the review, analysis and determination of
whether certain transfers of municipal securities qualified for sale accounting
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities." As a result, the Trust's independent registered public
accountants advised the Trust that this control deficiency represented a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2006. Since October 31, 2006, and prior to the issuance of the Trust's annual
report, management has revised its disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal control over financial reporting in order to improve the controls'
effectiveness to ensure that transactions in transfers of municipal securities
are accounted for properly.

Management notes that other investment companies investing in similar
investments over the same time periods had been accounting for such investments
in a similar manner as the Trust. Accordingly, other investment companies are
also concluding that there was a material weakness in their internal control
over financial reporting of such investments. The changes in the Trust's
financial statements did not impact the net asset value of the Trust's shares or
the Trust's total return for any period.

(b) There were no changes in the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the period covered
by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.
However, as discussed above, subsequent to October 31, 2006, the Trust's
internal control over financial reporting was revised.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

                AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2005

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.
