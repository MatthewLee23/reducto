The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of representations, which provide general
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund.

(a) Valuation of Investments

Readily marketable portfolio securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange
are generally valued at the last sale price reflected on the consolidated tape
at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the business day as of which such
value is being determined. If no sales are reported, the securities are valued
at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such day. If no bid or asked
prices are quoted on such day, then the security is valued by such method as the
Fund's Board of Trustees shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair
market value. Readily marketable securities not listed on the New York Stock
Exchange but listed on other domestic or foreign securities exchanges or trading
on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, Inc.
("NASDAQ") National List are valued in a like manner. Portfolio securities
traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on
the business day as of which such value is being determined as reflected on the
consolidated tape at the close of the exchange representing the principal market
for such securities.

Readily marketable securities traded in the over-the-counter market, including
listed securities whose primary market is believed by the Advisor to be
over-the-counter, but excluding securities admitted to trading on the NASDAQ
national list, are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices as
reported by NASDAQ or, in the case of securities not quoted by NASDAQ, the
National Quotation Bureau or such other comparable source as the Fund's Trustees
deem appropriate to reflect fair market value. However, certain fixed-income
securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service
when such prices are believed by the Trustees to reflect the fair market value
of such securities. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange and
also over-the-counter, the securities will generally be valued using the
quotations the Trustees believe reflect most closely the value of such
securities.

Short-term debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are
valued at amortized cost or amortized value, which approximates market value.

(b) Investment Transactions and Investment Income

Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on an
accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities purchased are accreted
or amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities
using the effective interest method.

Note 3 - Investment Management Agreement, Servicing Agreement and Other
         Agreements:

Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement") between the
Fund and the Advisor, the Advisor is responsible for the daily management of the
Fund's portfolio of investments, which includes buying and selling securities
for the Fund, as well as investment research. The Advisor will receive an annual
fee from the Fund based on the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets
which includes the amount from the issuance of the Preferred Shares. In
addition, subject to the approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees, a pro rata
portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement benefits and
similar employment costs for the time spent on Fund operations (other than the
provision of services required under the Agreement) of all personnel employed by
the Advisor who devote substantial time to Fund operations may be reimbursed by
the Fund to the Advisor. The annual fee will be determined as follows:

(a) If the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated
    monthly) is greater than $250 million, the fee will be a maximum amount
    equal to 0.54% of the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In
    addition, the Advisor has voluntarily agreed to waive receipt of a portion
    of the management fee or other expenses of the Fund in the amount of 0.115%
    of the average weekly values of the Managed Assets for the first five years
    of the Fund's operations and for a declining amount for an additional three
    years.

(b) If the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated
    monthly) is $250 million or less, the fee will be a maximum amount equal to
    0.55% of the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In addition,
    the Advisor has voluntarily agreed to waive receipt of a portion of the
    management fee or other expenses of the Fund in the amount of 0.025% of the
    average weekly values of the Managed Assets for the first five years of the
    Fund's operations, after which the Advisor anticipates that it will not
    waive any portion of the management fee.

Pursuant to a Servicing Agreement, the Servicing Agent will act as servicing
agent to the Fund. The Servicing Agent will receive an annual fee from the Fund,
which will be based on the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets.
The fee will be determined as follows:

(a) If the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated
    monthly) is greater than $250 million, the fee will be a maximum amount
    equal to 0.21% of the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In
    addition, the Servicing Agent has voluntarily agreed to waive receipt of a
    portion of the servicing fee of the Fund in the amount of 0.085% of the
    average weekly values of the Managed Assets for the first five years of the
    Fund's operations and for a declining amount for an additional three years.

Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund | Notes to Financial
Statements continued

(b) If the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated
    monthly) is $250 million or less, the fee will be a maximum amount equal to
    0.20% of the average weekly value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In
    addition, the Servicing Agent has voluntarily agreed to waive receipt of a
    portion of the servicing fee of the Fund in the amount of 0.175% of the
    average weekly values of the Managed Assets for the first five years of the
    Fund's operations and for a declining amount for an additional three years.

The fee waivers of the Advisor and the Servicing Agent are contractual
commitments of more than one year.

The Bank of New York ("BNY") acts as the Fund's custodian, administrator and
transfer agent. As custodian, BNY is responsible for the custody of the Fund's
assets. As administrator, BNY is responsible for maintaining the books and
records of the Fund's securities and cash. As transfer agent, BNY is responsible
for performing transfer agency services for the Fund.

Note 4 - Federal Income Taxes:

The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by
distributing substantially all of its ordinary income and long-term capital
gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U.S. federal excise tax.

In order to present paid-in capital in excess of par and accumulated net
realized gains or losses on the statement of assets and liabilities that more
closely represent their tax character, certain adjustments have been made to
undistributed net investment income and accumulated net realized gains or losses
on investments. For the period ended October 31, 2003, the adjustments were to
increase accumulated net realized gain on investments by $82,770 and decrease
undistributed net investment income by $82,770 due to the difference in the
treatment for book and tax purposes of certain investments.

Information on the tax components of capital as of October 31, 2003 is as
follows:

                                                      Net tax
    Cost of                                         unrealized     Undistributed
investments       Gross tax       Gross tax      appreciation/  ordinary income/
    for tax      unrealized      unrealized  (depreciation) on      (accumulated
   purposes    appreciation    depreciation        investments    ordinary loss)

768,214,909     55,334,650      (4,623,165)         50,711,485       5,551,898

The differences between book basis and tax basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable to the tax deferral of losses on
wash sales and additional income accrued for tax purposes on the convertible
preferred stock.

For the period ended October 31, 2003 the tax character of distributions paid,
as reflected in the statement of changes in net assets, of $20,726,197 was
ordinary income.

Note 5 - Investments in Securities:

For the period ended October 31, 2003, purchases and sales of investments, other
than short-term securities, were $992,143,381 and $236,487,445, respectively.

Note 6 - Capital:

The Fund issued 20,800,000 shares of common stock, in its initial public
offering. These shares were all issued at $23.875 per share before a
reimbursement of expenses to the underwriters of $0.0083 per share. In
connection with the initial public offering of the Fund's common shares, the
underwriters were granted an option to purchase additional common shares. On May
16, 2003, June 9, 2003 and June 17, 2003, the underwriters purchased, at a price
of $23.875 per common share (before underwriters' expense reimbursement),
1,000,000, 1,000,000 and 500,000 common shares, respectively, of the Fund
pursuant to the over-allotment option.

Offering expenses in connection with the issuance of the common shares estimated
at $1,165,200 have been borne by the Fund and have been charged to
paid-in-capital in excess of par value. Advent Capital Management, LLC, the
Fund's investment advisor (the "Advisor"), and Claymore Securities, Inc., the
Fund's servicing agent (the "Servicing Agent"), have agreed to pay offering
expenses (other than the sales load, but including the reimbursement of expenses
to the underwriters) in excess of $.05 per common share, or approximately
$1,165,200. The Advisor and the Servicing Agent have also agreed to pay the
Fund's organizational expenses of approximately $35,000.

The Fund has an unlimited amount of common shares, $0.001 par value, authorized.
On June 19, 2003, the Fund's Board of Trustees authorized the issuance of
preferred shares, in addition to the existing common shares, as part of its
leverage strategy. Preferred shares to be issued by the Fund will have seniority
over the common shares. In connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment
plan, the Fund issued 48,385 shares during the period.

The Fund has issued 2,150 shares of Preferred Shares Series M7, 2,150 shares of
Preferred Shares Series T28, 2,150 shares of Preferred Shares Series W7 and
2,150 shares of Preferred Shares Series TH28 each with a net asset and
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accrued dividends.

Dividends are accumulated daily at an annual rate set through auction
procedures. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid
annually.

For the period ended October 31, 2003, the annualized dividend rates range from:

                  High      Low    At 10/31/03

Series M7         1.20%     1.06%     1.15%

Series T28        1.20%     1.09%     1.12%

Series W7         1.20%     0.98%     1.14%

Series TH28       1.18%     1.09%     1.15%

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund

Unless the registered owner of common shares elects to receive cash by
contacting the Plan Administrator, all dividends declared on common shares of
the Fund will be automatically reinvested by The Bank of New York (the "Plan
Administrator"),Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), in additional common shares of the
Fund.Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received and processed by the
Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date; otherwise such termination
or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
dividend or other distribution.Some brokers may automatically elect to receive
cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash in additional common shares of
the Fund for you.If you wish for all dividends declared on your common shares of
the Fund to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan,please contact your
broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each common shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such common shareholder's common shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common
shares.The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants'accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common
shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere.If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commissions per common share is equal to
or greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan Administrator
will invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants.The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per common share on the payment date; provided
that,if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per common share on the payment date.If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per common share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in common shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.

If, before the Plan Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the
market price per common share exceeds the net asset value per common share, the
average per common share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of
fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued Common
Shares on the Dividend payment date.Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan
Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market
Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease
making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the
Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at the net asset value per common
share at the close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that, if the
net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price
per common share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of
the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records.Common shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares purchased
or received pursuant to the Plan.The Plan Administrator will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under
the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued directly
by the Fund.However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases.The automatic
reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any Federal, state or
local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such
Dividends.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants.

All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Administrator, The Bank of New York, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York
10286, Attention: Irina Krylov, Phone Number: (212) 815-2060.

                  CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                                     OF THE
                     ADVENT CLAYMORE CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES
                                 AND INCOME FUND

                       AS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES
                                  JUNE 19, 2003

          The Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund (the
"Fund") is committed to conducting business in accordance with applicable laws,
rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to full
and accurate disclosure -- financial and otherwise -- in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to the Fund's Chief Executive
Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing
similar functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth policies to guide
you in the performance of your duties.

          As a Senior Officer, you must comply with applicable law. You also
have a responsibility to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner. You
have leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high ethical
standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment that
encourages the internal reporting of compliance concerns and promptly addressing
compliance concerns.

          This Code of Ethics recognizes that the Senior Officers are subject to
certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment companies,
because the Senior Officers currently or may in the future serve as Senior
Officers of the Fund, as officers or employees of the Fund's investment advisor
(the "Advisor") and as officers or trustees of other registered investment
companies and unregistered investment funds advised by the Advisor. This Code of
Ethics also recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and
certain policies and procedures adopted by, the Fund or the Advisor govern your
conduct in connection with many of the conflict of interest situations that
arise in connection with the operations of the Fund, including:

..    the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the rules and regulation
     promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "1940
     Act");

..    the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and regulations
     promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
     "Advisers Act");

..    the Code of Ethics adopted by the Fund and the other Funds pursuant to Rule
     17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act (collectively, the "Fund's 1940 Act Code of
     Ethics");

..    one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisor that have been reviewed
     and approved by those trustees (the "Trustees") of the Fund that are not
     "interested persons" of the Fund (the "Independent Trustees") within the
     meaning of the 1940 Act (the "Advisor's 1940 Act Code of Ethics" and,
     together with the Fund's 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the "1940 Act Codes of
     Ethics");

                                       1

<PAGE>


..    the policies and procedures adopted by the Fund to address conflict of
     interest situations, such as procedures under Rule 10f-3 and Rule 17a-7
     under the 1940 Act (collectively, the "Fund Policies"); and

..    the Advisor's general policies and procedures to address, among other
     things, conflict of interest situations and related matters (collectively,
     the "Advisor Policies").

The provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the Fund Policies and the Advisor Policies are referred to herein collectively
as the "Additional Conflict Rules."

          This Code of Ethics is different from, and is intended to supplement,
the Additional Conflict Rules. Accordingly, a violation of the Additional
Conflict Rules by a Senior Officer is hereby deemed not to be a violation of
this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the
"Board") shall determine that any such violation of the Additional Conflict
Rules is also a violation of this Code of Ethics.

Senior Officers Should Act Honestly and Candidly

          Each Senior Officer has a responsibility to the Fund to act with
integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid.
Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

          Each Senior Officer must:

..    act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still
     maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law or the
     Additional Conflict Rules;

..    comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of the
     Fund's operations and report any suspected violations thereof in accordance
     with the section below entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

..    adhere to a high standard of business ethics.

Conflicts Of Interest

          A conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics occurs
when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere,
with the interests of the Fund.

          Senior Officers are expected to use objective and unbiased standards
when making decisions that affect the Fund, keeping in mind that Senior Officers
are subject to certain inherent conflicts of interest because Senior Officers of
a Fund also are or may be officers of other Funds, the Advisor and other funds
advised or serviced by the Advisor (as a result of which it is incumbent upon
you to be familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict
Rules).

          You are required to conduct the business of the Fund in an honest and
ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts
of interest between personal and business relationships. When making any
investment, accepting any position or benefits, participating in any transaction
or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates or appears
to create a conflict of interest with respect to the Fund where you are
receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the letter and
spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                                       2

<PAGE>

          If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of this
Code of Ethics to you as a Senior Officer of the Fund, you should make full
disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances to the general counsel of the
Advisor (the "General Counsel") and obtain the approval of the General Counsel
prior to taking action.

          Some conflict of interest situations that should always be approved by
the General Counsel, if material, include the following:

..    the receipt of any entertainment or non-nominal gift by the Senior Officer,
     or a member of his or her family, from any company with which the Fund has
     current or prospective business dealings (other than the Advisor), unless
     such entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
     appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any
     question of impropriety;

..    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
     with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Advisor; or

..    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
     or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for
     selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Senior
     Officer's employment by the Advisor, such as compensation or equity
     ownership.

Disclosures

          It is the policy of the Fund to make full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
in all reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission or a national securities exchange and in all
other public communications made by the Fund. As a Senior Officer, you are
required to promote compliance with this policy and to abide by the Fund's
standards, policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with this
policy.

          Each Senior Officer must:

..    familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable
     to the Fund as well as the business and financial operations of the Fund;
     and

..    not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about
     the Fund to others, including to the Trustees, the Fund's independent
     auditors, the Fund's counsel, counsel to the Independent Trustees,
     governmental regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance With Code Of Ethics

          If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics or other
laws, regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Fund, you must
report that information on a timely basis to the General Counsel or report it
anonymously by following the "whistle blower" policies adopted by the Audit
Committee of the Fund from time to time. No one will be subject to retaliation
because of a good faith report of a suspected violation.

                                       3

<PAGE>


          The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

..    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
     actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

..    violations and potential violations will be reported to the Board after
     such investigation;

..    if the Board determines that a violation has occurred, it will take all
     appropriate disciplinary or preventive action; and

..    appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a letter of
     censure, suspension, dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other
     serious violations of law, notification of the Securities and Exchange
     Commission or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.

Waivers Of Code Of Ethics

          Except as otherwise provided in this Code of Ethics, the General
Counsel is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics to specific situations
in which questions are presented to the General Counsel and has the authority to
interpret this Code of Ethics in any particular situation. The General Counsel
shall take all action he or she considers appropriate to investigate any actual
or potential violations reported under this Code of Ethics.

          The General Counsel is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
counsel to the Fund, the Advisor or the Independent Trustees, and is encouraged
to do so.

          The Board is responsible for granting waivers of this Code of Ethics,
as appropriate. Any changes to or waivers of this Code of Ethics will, to the
extent required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR, or otherwise, as provided by
Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

Recordkeeping

          The Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the date an action is taken, the first two (2) years in an easily
accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the Board:

..    that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver to this Code of Ethics;
     and

..    relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions imposed for
     such violation, together with a written record of the approval or action
     taken by the Board.

Confidentiality

          All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
of Ethics shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

                                                                     EXHIBIT (c)

                         ADVENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.    POLICY STATEMENT

            Introduction - Advent Capital Management, LLC (the "Advisor") is
adopting these proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies and
Procedures") in order to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended and its associated recordkeeping requirements.

            The Policies and Procedures apply to those client accounts (i) that
contain voting securities; and (ii) for which the Advisor has authority to vote
client proxies. The Policies and Procedures will be reviewed and, as necessary,
updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting issues. Other,
similar rights such as consent rights shall be evaluated on a case by case
basis.

            Pursuant to the Policies and Procedures and its fiduciary duties,
the Advisor will vote client proxies as part of its authority to manage, acquire
and dispose of account assets. When voting proxies for client accounts, the
Advisor's primary objective is to make voting decisions solely in the best
interests of clients and beneficiaries and participants of benefits plans for
which we manage assets. In fulfilling its obligations to clients, the Advisor
will act in a manner deemed to be prudent and diligent and which is intended to
enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held in client accounts.
In certain situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide the Advisor with a
statement of proxy voting policy. In these situations, the Advisor seeks to
comply with such policy to the extent it would not be inconsistent with
applicable regulation or the fiduciary responsibility of the Advisor.

            Duty to Vote Proxies - The Advisor acknowledges that it is part of
its fiduciary duty to its clients to vote client proxies, except in cases in
which the cost of doing so, in the opinion of the Advisor, would exceed the
expected benefits to the client. This may be particularly true in the case of
non-U.S. securities. While the proxy voting process is well established in the
United States and other developed markets with a number of tools and services
available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies of non-US companies
located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging markets, may involve a
number of logistical problems that may have a detrimental effect on the
Advisor's ability to vote such proxies. The logistical problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English, (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings, (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes, (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting, and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the Advisor's voting instructions. Accordingly, the Advisor may conduct a
cost-benefit analysis in determining whether to attempt to vote its clients'
shares at a non-US


                                       1

<PAGE>

company's meeting, whereby if it is determined that the cost associated with the
attempt to exercise its vote outweighs the benefit the Advisor believes its
clients will derive by voting on the company's proposal, the Advisor may decide
not to attempt to vote at the meeting.

            Material Conflicts - The Advisor will vote its clients' proxies in
the best interests of its clients and not its own. In voting client proxies, the
Advisor will avoid material conflicts of interests between the interests of the
Advisor and its affiliates on the one hand and the interests of its clients on
the other. The Advisor recognizes that it may have a material conflict of
interest in voting a client proxy where (i) it manages assets, administers
employee benefit plans, or provides brokerage, underwriting or insurance to
companies whose management is soliciting proxies; (ii) it manages money for an
employee group that is the proponent of a proxy proposal; (iii) has a personal
relationship with participants in a proxy solicitation or a director or
candidate for director; or (iv) it otherwise has a personal interest in the
outcome in a particular matter before shareholders. Notwithstanding the above
categories, the Advisor understands that the determination of whether a
"material conflict" exists depends on all of the facts and circumstances of the
particular situation. The Advisor acknowledges the existence of a relationship
of the type discussed above, even in the absence of any active efforts to
solicit the investment adviser with respect to a proxy vote, is sufficient for a
material conflict to exist.

II.    GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

            It is the policy of the Advisor in voting proxies to consider and
vote each proposal with the objective of maximizing long-term investment returns
for its clients. To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its
clients, the Advisor utilizes the proxy voting guidelines (the "Proxy Voting
Guidelines") set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range of issues,
including board size and composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover
proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility issues

III. ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A.   Proxy Review Committee

     The Advisor's Proxy Review Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for
     creating and implementing the Policies and Procedures and, in that regard,
     has adopted the general principles and guidelines set forth above in
     Sections I and II. Among other things, the Committee is responsible for the
     following:

     1.   The Committee, consisting of members designated by the Chief Executive
          Officer, shall establish and review these Policies and Procedures and
          determine how the Advisor will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

     2.   The Committee shall have the authority to amend and change the
          Policies and Procedures and designate voting positions consistent with
          the objective of maximizing long-term investment returns for the
          Advisor's clients.

     3.   The Committee shall meet as needed to oversee and address all
          questions relating to the Advisor's Policies and Procedures,
          including: (1) general review of proposals being put forth at
          shareholder meetings of portfolio companies; (2) adopting

                                        8

<PAGE>

          changes in the Policies and Procedures; (3) determining whether voting
          on matters in the manner favored by the Advisor are "material"
          conflicts of interests within the meaning of Rule 206(4)-6 under the
          Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended; (4) determining how to
          vote matters for which specific direction has not been provided the
          Proxy Voting Guidelines (i.e. "case by case" matters) or are otherwise
          not covered by the Proxy Voting Guidelines (collectively,
          "Discretionary Proposals"); (5) determining whether to override the
          Proxy Voting Guidelines with respect to any proxy vote; and (6)
          designating a compliance officer (the "Compliance Officer") to
          implement the Operating Procedures set forth in Part B of this Section
          III.

     4.   The Committee will periodically review the Proxy Voting Guidelines to
          determine if they are current and consistent with the Advisor's policy
          and will make appropriate changes as needed.

B.   Operating Procedures

The following operating procedures are intended to ensure that the Advisor
satisfies its proxy voting obligations:

     1.   The Compliance Officer will review all new client accounts to
          determine whether (i) the account contains voting securities and (ii)
          the client has delegated proxy voting authorization to the Advisor in
          the investment advisory agreement or (iii) the client has otherwise
          provided specific voting instructions. Any questions regarding whether
          or not a security is a "voting" security or whether voting authority
          has been delegated by a client will be directed to the General Counsel
          of the Advisor.

     2.   The Compliance Officer will receive proxy materials and ballots and
          reconcile these materials with holdings in client accounts at least
          once monthly.

     3.   The Compliance Officer will compile and review the matters to be voted
          on, at least once monthly, and determine: (i) which matters are to be
          voted in accordance with the Proxy Voting Guidelines (a
          "Pre-Determined Matter"); and (ii) which matters are Discretionary
          Matters and (iii) which matters are to be voted pursuant to the
          instructions of clients (a "Directed Matter"). Any questions regarding
          whether a matter is a Pre-Determined Matter, a Discretionary Matter or
          a Directed Matter will be directed to the General Counsel of the
          Advisor.

     4.   For all Discretionary Matters, the Compliance Officer shall screen the
          matter and make a preliminary determination regarding whether the
          matter presents a potential material conflict of interest between the
          interests of the Advisor and its affiliates on the one hand and the
          Advisor's client on the other.

          In order to determine whether a Discretionary Matter poses a potential
          material conflict of interest, the Compliance Officer shall compile
          and maintain a list of the following as applicable:

          (a) all issuers for which the Advisor or its affiliates manages
          assets;

          (b) all issuers for which the Advisor or its affiliates administers
          employee benefit plans;

                                       9

<PAGE>

         (c) all issuers for which the Advisor or its affiliates brokerage,
         underwriting or insurance;

         (d) any issuer for which the Advisor or its affiliates is soliciting
         the provision of services enumerated in (a), (b) and (c);

         (e) any other issuer with which the Advisor or its affiliates or its
         senior officers has a material business relationship; and

         (f) any employee group for which the Advisor manages money;

         This list, which the Compliance Officer shall update at least
         quarterly, shall be known as the "Master Conflicts List."

         The Compliance Officer shall screen the issuer, employee group or any
         other material related party ("Material Parties") involved in the
         Discretionary Matter against the Master Conflicts List and develop a
         list of potential conflicts ("Potential Conflicts List").

     5.  For each Discretionary Matter, the Compliance Officer shall solicit
         written reports from portfolio managers, investment personnel, analysts
         and other employees of the advisor who may have an investment or other
         professional interest in the Discretionary Matter. The Compliance
         Officer shall compile these reports in an "Advisory Report."

     6.  The Compliance Officer shall present each meeting of the Committee
         with: (i) a list of all Pre-Determined Matters to be voted in
         accordance with the Proxy Voting Guidelines; (ii) a list of all
         Discretionary Matters; (iii) a list of all Directed Matters to be voted
         in accordance with client instructions (iv) the Potential Conflicts
         List; and (v) any Advisory Reports.

     7.  The Committee shall meet quarterly. The Committee shall review and
         approve the list of Pre-Determined Matters to be voted in accordance
         with the Proxy Voting Guidelines and the list of all Directed Matters
         to be voted in accordance with client instructions. For each
         Discretionary Matter presented, the Committee will determine: (i) the
         manner in which to vote on the proxy and, (ii) whether the manner in
         which the Committee has determined to vote the proxy would, under the
         facts and circumstances, create a material conflict of interest between
         the interests of the Advisor and its affiliates on the one hand and the
         Advisor's clients on the other. In making the finding required in (ii)
         above, the Committee shall consider the Potential Conflicts List and
         any other material relationship known to the Committee between the
         Advisor and its affiliates and the Material Parties.

         If the Proxy Review Committee determines that with respect to any
         Discretionary Matter that a material conflict of interest exists in
         voting the Discretionary Matter in the manner favored by the Committee,
         the Committee shall direct the Compliance Officer to obtain the
         informed written consent of the affected client (or clients) to the
         Committee's favored vote. If obtaining such consent from any client is
         impracticable or undesirable, the Advisor shall vote the client's proxy
         in accordance with the recommendation of an independent third-party
         service provider experienced in such matters to be retained by the
         Advisor on a case-by-case basis, as necessary.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     8.  If any portfolio manager, investment person, or any other employee of
         the Advisor wishes to vote a proxy with respect to a Pre-Determined
         Matter in a manner other than that set forth in the Proxy Voting
         Guidelines (an "Override Matter"), such person shall contact the
         Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer shall screen the Override
         Matter against the Master List and include the results on the Potential
         Conflicts List. The Compliance Officer shall also solicit an Advisory
         Report for presentation to the Committee. The Override Matter shall be
         presented at the next scheduled meeting of the Committee for a
         determination of: (i) whether the matter should be voted in a manner
         other than as specified in the Proxy Voting Guidelines; and (ii)
         whether the manner in which the Committee has determined to vote the
         proxy would constitute a material conflict of interest. If the
         Committee determines that a material conflict of interest exists with
         respect to voting the Override Matter in the manner it favors, the
         Committee shall direct the Compliance Officer to either: (i) vote the
         Override Matter in the manner originally prescribed by the Proxy Voting
         Guidelines; or (ii) obtain the informed written consent of the affected
         client (or clients) to the Committee's favored vote.

     9.  Directed Matters will be voted in accordance with the instructions of
         the client.

     10. The Compliance Officer will ensure that all proxies are voted in
         accordance with these Procedures and Policies.

     11. The Compliance Officer may delegate any of his or her functions to a
         third party proxy voting or other service provider.

     12. All decisions of the Committee, including all determinations regarding
         whether or not a material conflict of interest existed with respect to
         a Discretionary or Override Matter and the basis for such
         determination, shall be documented in writing and maintained by the
         Compliance Officer for a period of at least 6 years.

The Advisor's disclosure will consist of a "concise summary" of its proxy voting
policies and procedures. This disclosure will also tell clients how to get a
complete copy of the Advisor's policies and procedures. The proxy voting
disclosure will be provided to existing clients with their first quarterly
account statement after June 30, 2003. The Advisor's proxy voting disclosure
will be provided to new clients in the Advisor's "brochure" or Part II to its
Form ADV which will be delivered with a letter identifying the presence of the
disclosure. The Compliance Officer will provide any client, upon written
request, with a tabulation of how such client's proxies were voted by the
Advisor.

V.    RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS

         Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, as amended, requires that the
Advisor retain (i) its proxy voting policies and procedures; (ii) proxy
statements received regarding client securities; (iii) records of votes it cast
on behalf of clients; (iv) records of client requests for proxy voting
information, and (v) any documents prepared by the investment adviser that were
material to making a decision how to vote, or that memorialized the basis for
the decision. The Advisor will keep all written requests from clients and any
written response from the Advisor (to either a written or an oral request). The
Advisor may rely on proxy statements filed on the SEC's EDGAR system instead of
keeping its own copies, and may rely on proxy statements and records of proxy
votes cast by the Advisor that are maintained with a third party such as a proxy
voting service, provided that the Advisor has obtained an undertaking from the
third party to provide a copy of the documents promptly upon request.
