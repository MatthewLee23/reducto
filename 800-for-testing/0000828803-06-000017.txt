                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management
                            groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the 12 months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +13.39% based on market price and +8.48% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of -0.03% in local currency terms
and +0.47% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period. 1 You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Global economic growth remained strong for the year under review and
demonstrated resilience to higher commodity prices, including oil, and the
normalization of global interest rates. Regionally, growth was generally robust
in Asia, strengthening in Europe and moderating in the U.S.

The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (Fed) led the global interest rate tightening
cycle with consecutive 25-basis-point increases starting mid-2004 (100 basis
points equal one percentage point). As household consumption moderated and the
housing market cooled amid inflation pressure stemming from labor costs and
energy prices, the Fed paused with the federal funds target rate at 5.25% after
raising short-term interest rates 175 basis points during the 12-month period.
Inflation rose to its highest level since 2001, or 2.8%, in August as measured
by the core Consumer Price Index (CPI). 2 Higher inflation and the Fed's
tightening of short-term interest rates pressured U.S. bond yields higher in the
past 12 months, leaving a relatively flat yield curve with the 10-year Treasury
note yield at 4.74% on August 31, 2006, and the 30-year Treasury bond yield at
4.88%. Although the U.S. dollar weakened 3.02% versus its major trading partners
and the difference in growth rates between the U.S. and its major trading
partners narrowed during the period, the U.S. current account deficit remained
large at 6.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of second quarter
2006. 3

Regionally, the Pacific Rim, which accounted for 48% of the U.S. trade deficit,
continued to play a prominent role in terms of global imbalances, characterized
by the large U.S. current account deficit. 4 The international reserve
accumulation by major oil producers and export-intensive countries such as China
remained significant during the reporting period. For example, by the end of
June 2006, China's international reserves were US$941 billion, increasing on
average US$20 billion per month. 5 Growth in Asia was generally robust,
accompanied by increasing domestic demand in some countries. Trade surpluses in
Asia (outside of China) narrowed, as oil prices and stronger domestic demand
contributed to rising imports. Relative to the 3.6% GDP growth in the U.S. in
second quarter 2006 year-over-year, China's economy grew 11.3%, Singapore's 8.1%
and South Korea's 5.3%. 6 Although Asia's interest rate policy tightened during
the year, the most notable shift in monetary policy was in Japan. During the
period, the country ended its policy of quantitative easing and a zero percent
interest rate, adopted in 2001 to combat entrenched deflation and weak domestic
growth prospects. Stronger domestic demand, driven by investment, and prospects
for sustainable positive inflation led the Bank of Japan to increase interest
rates 25 basis points in July 2006.

While the U.S. and Asia demonstrated relatively strong growth throughout the
current economic upswing, much of Europe lagged. However, driven by exports and
investment, Europe's growth rates during the 12-month period notably improved
and were generally above expectations. The European Central Bank (ECB) began
increasing interest rates in December 2005 and tightened a cumulative 100 basis
points through the reporting period. Although unemployment rates remained high
in some of the larger economies such as Germany and France, they exhibited
gradual improvement over the year. Similar trends, sometimes amplified, can be
found throughout non-euro European countries such as Poland, Norway and Sweden.
For example, Poland's economic growth rose 5.5% in second quarter 2006
year-over-year, while Norway's and Sweden's increased 3.8% and 5.1%. 7 Although
these three countries experienced a low inflation/strong growth environment,
signs of capacity constraints emerged as labor markets tightened and resource
utilization rose. In total, Norway's and Sweden's central banks each increased
interest rates 100 basis points, while Poland's reduced rates 100 basis points
during the 12-month period.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency rates
and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.
Despite the high commodity price environment, increased geopolitical tensions
and a broadly rising global interest rate environment, we generated positive
results largely through our flexibility to derive return from various sources
including duration, income and currency exchange rates.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

During the year under review, we shortened the portfolio's overall duration amid
rising global interest rates, which benefited the Fund's relative performance.
The largest contributor to Fund performance was our overweighted position in
Indonesia. The Fund's investments in Indonesia's longer duration local currency
bonds benefited from a 100-basis-point interest rate reduction during the
period. In the 12-month period, the Indonesian bond market returned +27.70% in
local currency terms, as measured by the HSBC Asian Local Bond Index (ALBI). 8
On the other hand, the Fund's lack of exposure to the U.K. bond market detracted
from relative performance, given the long-term bonds' solid performance due to a
pension regulation change. According to the JPM GGBI, the U.K. bond market rose
+2.76% in local currency terms during the period and outperformed the index. 1

CURRENCY STRATEGY

The Fund benefited from its significantly underweighted exposure to the U.S.
dollar, which depreciated 3.02% against the U.S.'s major trading partners. 3
Factors behind the weaker U.S. dollar included the fading impact of the Homeland
Investment Act, which allowed U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign profits at
a lower tax rate in 2005, as well as the Fed's interest rate policy approaching
neutral (as opposed to expansionary or restrictive). Notably, higher U.S. bond
yields relative to other developed bond markets provided a key source of funding
for the U.S. current account deficit.

4 | Annual Report

Regionally, we significantly reduced the Fund's euro and U.S. dollar currency
exposure in favor of non-euro European and Asian currencies. Countries with
solid external fundamentals and positive domestic growth prospects such as
Canada were key contributors to the Fund's relative performance. During the
period, we significantly increased the Fund's exposure to the Canadian dollar,
which rose 7.06% against the U.S. dollar. 9 The country's vast natural resources
strengthened its balance of payment position in a rising commodity price
environment and supported its currency, as Canada's trade surplus increased and
foreign investment inflows into the energy sector rose. In Europe, we sought to
offset the relatively negative impact of being underweighted in the euro with
overweighted positions in non-euro European countries such as Poland and Sweden,
whose currencies outperformed the euro in the 12-month period and helped the
Fund's relative results. The Polish zloty rose 7.51% against the U.S. dollar,
while the Swedish krona rose 4.99% against the U.S. dollar and 0.87% against the
euro. 9 On the other hand, the Fund's Icelandic krona exposure and no exposure
to the British pound detracted from relative performance.

In Asia, the Fund's basket of non-Japan currencies generated strong positive
returns, and also outperformed the yen, which was an underweighted currency
position until late in the reporting period. In the past 12 months, the
Indonesian rupiah rose 13.22% against the U.S. dollar, the Thai baht 9.88%, the
South Korean won 8.22% and the Singapore dollar 7.14%, while the yen depreciated
5.24%.9 We took advantage of this period of euro strength relative to the yen to
reduce the Fund's exposure to the euro and initiate exposure to the yen late in
the period. On a cumulative basis, the yen has underperformed the euro since the
end of 2000. During the last period of U.S. dollar weakness in 2002-2004, the
euro and other European currencies appreciated more than those of many Asian
countries, which were less affected by currency appreciation and instead built
up substantial foreign exchange reserves. Since then, the U.S. current account
deficit deteriorated, the euro zone's current account fell into a deficit, and
the Japanese current account surplus continued to grow. According to our
analysis, the Japanese economy's significant improvement -- evidenced by its
emergence from deflation and the central bank's subsequent fundamental shift in
monetary policy -- indicated that another potential period of U.S. dollar
depreciation would likely affect the Japanese yen.

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

We purchased investment-grade and subinvestment-grade sovereign debt that
typically compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher yields relative
to U.S. and European benchmark treasury yield curves. Despite rising short-term
U.S. interest rates, U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt generated a
+9.02% return over the period, as measured by the JPM Emerging Markets Bond
Index Global (EMBIG). 10 Sovereign interest rate spreads declined from 281 basis
points at the beginning of the reporting period to 197 basis points by
period-end. 11 Regionally, Latin American sovereign debt returned +11.64%, Asian
+10.00% and central and eastern European +3.56%. 10

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Global Income Fund. We
look forward to serving your future investment needs.

Sincerely,


                            /s/ Michael Hasenstab

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.


                                                              Annual Report | 19

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund intends to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These differences may be
permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital
accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact
on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transctions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through August 31, 2006, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the year ended August 31, 2006,
there were no share repurchases.

8. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 18.05% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

9. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

10. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative
fees paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

11. REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

11. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop separate plans for the distribution
of the respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan
pertaining to the distribution of the monies owed under the CAGO settlement
agreement, and in March 2005, the disbursement of monies to the relevant funds
in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement was completed.
The Fund did not participate in the CAGO Settlement.

On June 23, 2006, the SEC approved the IDC's proposed plan of distribution
arising from the December 13, 2004 SEC Order and disbursement of the settlement
monies to the designated funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the SEC's order and the plan was completed in September 2006. The Fund did not
participate in the December 13, 2004 SEC Order.

The IDC has also completed a proposed Plan of Distribution under the August 2,
2004 SEC Order resolving the SEC's market timing investigation and has submitted
that plan to the SEC staff, where it is under review. The SEC has announced the
following expected schedule with respect to the market timing Plan of
Distribution. The SEC anticipates that Notice of the Plan will be published on
or after November 15, 2006. After publication and comment, the proposed
Distribution Plan will be submitted to the SEC for approval. When the SEC
approves the proposed Distribution Plan, with modifications as appropriate,
distributions will begin pursuant to that Plan.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices referenced above,
as well as to allegedly excessive advisory fees, commissions, and/or 12b-1 fees.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.


                                                              Annual Report | 25

11. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition,
classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the
related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
date of effectiveness. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
applying the various provisions of FIN 48.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Global Income Fund (the
"Fund") at August 31, 2006, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2006 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

At August 31, 2006, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from dividends paid to the Fund on these
investments. As shown in the table below, the Fund designates to shareholders
the foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the
Internal Revenue Code. This designation will allow shareholders of record on
August 17, 2006, to treat their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the
Fund as having been paid directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these
amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund
distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by
the Fund, to shareholders of record.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or, as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income. 1

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. 1

In January 2007, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2006. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2006 individual income
tax returns.

1     Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in
      the 10% and 15% income tax brackets). In determining the amount of foreign
      tax credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of
      individuals receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may
      be required to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect
      the rate differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules
      however permit certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate
      differential adjustments for capital gains and/or dividends for any
      taxable year. Please consult your tax advisor and the instructions to Form
      1116 for more information.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to Mellon
Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a
maximum of $5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her
account. These payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held May 11, 2006, the Board of Trustees ("Board"), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for the Fund. In reaching this decision, the
Board took into account information furnished throughout the year at regular
Board meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in connection with
the annual renewal review process. Information furnished and discussed
throughout the year included investment performance reports and related
financial information for the Fund, as well as periodic reports on shareholder
services, legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager ("Manager") and its
affiliates. Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal
process included a report for the Fund prepared by Lipper, Inc. ("Lipper"), an
independent organization, as well as a Fund profitability analysis report
prepared by management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's investment
performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable to the Fund
as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report discussed the
profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall U.S. fund
operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included with such
profitability analysis report was information on a fund-by-fund basis listing
portfolio managers and other accounts they manage, as well as information on
management fees charged by the Manager and its affiliates including management's
explanation of differences where relevant and a three-year expense analysis with
an explanation for any increase in expense ratios. Additional information
accompanying such report was a memorandum prepared by management describing
enhancements to the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin Templeton
Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to economies of
scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's efforts and
expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures

to function in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted by the Board that
such systems and procedures had functioned smoothly during the hurricanes and
blackout experienced last year in Florida. Consideration was also given to the
experience of the Fund's portfolio management team, the number of accounts
managed and general method of compensation. In this latter respect, the Board
noted that a primary factor in management's determination of a portfolio
manager's bonus compensation was the relative investment performance of the
funds he or she managed so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund
shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement
renewals. The Lipper report for the Fund showed its investment performance in
respect to both a closed-end fund group, as well as an open-end performance
universe for the one-year period ended February 28, 2006, as well as the
previous ten years ended that date. Such report considered both the Fund's
income return and total return on a net asset value basis without regard to
market discounts or premiums in order to accurately reflect investment
performance. The closed-end fund group selected by Lipper consisted of the Fund
and three other non-leveraged closed-end global income funds. The Lipper report
showed that the Fund's income return for the one-year period was the highest in
such group and in each of the previous three-, five- and ten-year periods on an
annualized basis was the lowest of such group, while its total return was the
lowest in such group for the one-year period, but was the highest of such group
for each of the three- and five-year periods, and in the middle for the ten-year
period. The open-end performance universe consisted of the Fund and all open-end
retail and institutional global income funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper
report showed the Fund's income return and total return to be in the highest and
second-highest quintile of such performance universe for the one-year period,
respectively, and its income and total return to both be in the highest quintile
of such universe for each of the previous three-, five- and ten-year periods on
an annualized basis. The Board was satisfied with such comparative performance.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
selected expense group consisting of the Fund and the three other closed-end
funds comprising the closed-end fund group referred to in the discussion of
investment performance. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a
survey showing that the scope of management advisory services covered under the
Fund's investment management agreement was similar to those provided by fund
managers to other fund groups that would be used as a basis of comparison in the
Lipper reports. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was given to each
Fund's management fee in comparison with the effective management fee that would
have been charged by the other funds within the Lipper expense group assuming
they were the same size as the Fund, as well as the

actual total expenses of the Fund in comparison with those of the other funds.
The Lipper effective management fee analysis considers administrative fees to be
part of management fees and the results of such expense comparison showed both
the Fund's effective management fee rate and total actual expenses to be the
lowest of such group. The Board was satisfied with the Fund's comparative
management fee and expenses.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
each of the individual funds. The Board also considered the extent to which the
Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations.
Specific attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to
the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently
subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while
producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted that the cost
allocation methodology was consistent with that followed in profitability report
presentations for the Fund made in prior years and that the Fund's independent
registered public accounting firm had been engaged by the Manager to perform
certain procedures on a biennial basis, specified and approved by the Manager
and the Fund's Board solely for their purposes and use in reference to the
profitability analysis. Included in the analysis were the revenue and related
costs involved in providing services to the Fund, as well as the Fund's relative
contribution to the profitability of the Manager's parent. In reviewing and
discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that
costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary to the type of fund
operations conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully
reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain
extent, reflected operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by
management. The Board also took into account management's expenditures in
improving shareholder services provided the Fund, as well as the need to meet
additional regulatory and compliance requirements resulting from the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and recent SEC requirements. In addition, the Board
considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's
parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken
down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. Based upon
its consideration of all these factors, the Board determined that the level of
profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates from providing services to
the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature, quality and extent of services
provided.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
Manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders. In this respect, the Board
noted the Fund is charged a management advisory fee and administrative fee at
the combined rate of 0.70% on its first $200 million of net assets; 0.635% on
the next $500 million of net assets; 0.60% on the next $300 million of net
assets; and 0.58% on the next $4 billion of net assets with decreasing
breakpoints continuing through the $20 billion net asset level, and at the
Fund's asset size at year-end of approximately $1.1 billion, such fee schedule
provides a sharing of benefits with the Fund and its shareholders.

The Fund has established Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policies") that
the Fund uses to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.      N/A


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the
manager perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees;  defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another  independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
evaluates  plans on a  case-by-case  basis by  considering  several  factors  to
determine   whether  the  plan  is  fair  and  reasonable,   including  the  ISS
quantitative  model  utilized  to assess  such  plans  and/or  the  Glass  Lewis
evaluation of the plans.  The manager will generally  oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively  dilutive,  and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater  options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support  employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issues. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies online at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954-527-76788 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted
on the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV and reflect the twelve-month period beginning
July 1, 2005, and ending June 30, 2006.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance-based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS.  The management of multiple  funds,  including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to  potential  conflicts  of  interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives,  benchmarks,  time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio  manager  must  allocate his or her time and  investment  ideas across
multiple  funds  and  accounts.  The  manager  seeks to  manage  such  competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio  managers by having  portfolio
manager's  focus on a  particular  investment  discipline.  Most other  accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment  strategies
that are  used in  connection  with the  management  of the  Fund.  Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar  across  similar  portfolios,  which  may  minimize  the  potential  for
conflicts of  interest.  As noted above,  the separate  management  of the trade
execution and valuation  functions  from the portfolio  management  process also
helps to reduce potential  conflicts of interest.  However,  securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund.  Moreover,  if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity  that may be suitable for more than one fund or other  account,  the
Fund  may not be  able to take  full  advantage  of that  opportunity  due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair  allocation of buy and sell  opportunities  among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics, which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         a Franklin Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and  mutual fund shares
         (17.5% to 25%). The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to
         build a vested interest of the portfolio manager in the financial
         performance of both Franklin Resources and mutual funds advised by the
         manager. The bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of
         annual bonus compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager
         achieving consistently strong investment performance, which aligns the
         financial incentives of the portfolio manager and Fund shareholders.
         The Chief Investment Officer of the manager and/or other officers of
         the manager, with responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the
         granting of annual bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with
         Franklin Templeton guidelines. The following factors are generally
         used in determining bonuses under the plan:

         o    INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to
              the historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         o    NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions
              of a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the
              investment management team, including business knowledge,
              contribution to team efforts, mentoring of junior staff, and
              contribution to the marketing of the Fund, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         o    RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
              managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's
              appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds,
         and options to purchase common shares of a Franklin Templeton fund.
         Awards of such deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over
         time, so as to create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager as of August 31, 2006 (such amounts may change from
time to time):

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of Franklin Templeton Fund's code of

1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
