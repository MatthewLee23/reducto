DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services,
L.L.C., at 800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If
you have shares registered in "street" name, contact your financial advisor or
the broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Minnesota Municipal Income Fund I, and Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund II, all distributions of net investment income and capital
gains to common stock shareholders are automatically reinvested in additional
shares unless shareholders elect to receive all dividends and other
distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to shareholders by the
dividend plan agent. Under the current policies of Colorado Insured Municipal
Income Fund and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, distributions of net
investment income and capital gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash
unless shareholders notify Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. of their desire to
participate in the dividend reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.

MINNESOTA MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS I, II, and III

Q: WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT FOR MUNICIPAL INVESTING DID
   YOU ENCOUNTER IN MINNESOTA DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?
A: Minnesota's economy continued to emerge from recession but generally remained
in solid financial shape compared to most other states. The state benefited from
a high degree of personal wealth, a diversified employment base, and low
unemployment relative to the national average. These factors led credit-rating
agency Standard & Poor's to maintain its AAA rating--the highest possible--on
Minnesota's general obligation (GO) debt. In June 2003, however, Moody's,
another leading credit rating institution, downgraded the state's GOs from Aaa
to Aa1 with a stable outlook. Moody's cited Minnesota's deteriorating financial
strength because of substantial spending commitments, a decrease in financial
reserves, and overly optimistic revenue projections.

New municipal issuance in the state surpassed $6.1 billion in 2003, representing
a 14 percent drop from the prior year's total. In the first quarter of 2004,
however, new supply in the state totaled $1.2 billion, an 85 percent increase in
issuance over the same time period a year earlier (Source: The Bond Buyer).




<PAGE>

Q: HOW DID THE MINNESOTA MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS
   PERFORM DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A: For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2004, Minnesota Municipal Income
Funds I, II, and III returned +6.62%, +7.99%, and +7.43%*, respectively (all
returns reflect shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested). For
the same period, Minnesota Municipal Income Funds I, II, and III returned
+13.86%, +16.87%, and +15.76%, respectively (all returns reflect shares at
market price with distributions reinvested). All three Funds outperformed their
national benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which gained
+5.86%. The Funds' dividends from net investment income during the past 12
months were exempt from federal income and Minnesota state personal income
taxes.+

We attribute much of the Funds' outperformance relative to the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index to the presence of older bonds in the portfolio. We opted
to hold onto these securities, issued during more favorable interest-rate
environments, because they offered higher amounts of coupon income. In our view,
selling these bonds would have passed along unwanted capital gains to our
shareholders as well as lowered the Funds' overall yields.

Q: WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY IN MANAGING THE
   MINNESOTA FUNDS?
A: With interest rates at historically low levels throughout the period, we
anticipated an eventual rise in rates and continued to position the three Fund
portfolios for such a scenario. Specifically, we kept the Funds' durations
relatively modest to make the portfolios less vulnerable in the event rates
increase (duration is a common measure of a bond or bond fund's sensitivity to
interest rate changes; the longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond or
bond fund is to changes in interest rates). The Funds' durations did naturally
lengthen throughout the past 12 months as bonds matured from the portfolios and
we were forced to reinvest the proceeds at lower prevailing yields. This
activity was manageable throughout the period, however, and as of March 31,
2004, we believed the Funds were well-positioned for the possibility of higher
interest rates that are likely to accompany continued economic growth.

* Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

+ A portion of the income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the
  alternative minimum tax.

When making new investments, we continued to emphasize public-power revenue
bonds, which at period-end made up 25.97%, 6.69%, and 17.06% of portfolio assets
in Minnesota Municipal Income Funds I, II, and III, respectively. Our focus was
on basic utilities, which provide essential services such as electric
generation, transmission, and distribution. Unlike some of their investor-owned
counterparts, the public-power utilities we favored provided relatively stable
revenue streams. We also liked that most bonds in this area are insured, giving
the Funds an extra layer of security. Because there was a healthy supply of
public-power bonds during the period, we were able to add to our position in
this sector.

We also favored the hospital sector during the period. Following a number of
credit problems in the late 1990s and early 2000s, most hospitals have
experienced improvements in their financial strength. Despite these
improvements, we believe many hospital bonds are still trading at somewhat
depressed levels, given the steady credit improvements made. Through careful
research, we have sought to identify attractive value opportunities that we
believe can offer higher yields with only a modest amount of additional risk. By
contrast, continuing care retirement community (CCRC) bonds represented one area
of the market that we de-emphasized. We had concerns about the issuers' ability
to meet lofty occupancy-rate targets at these care facilities for seniors.

ARIZONA MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM DURING THE PERIOD?
A: During the 12-month period ended March 31, 2004, the Fund returned +7.86%*
(shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested). For the same period,
Arizona Municipal Income Fund returned +14.64% (shares at market price with
distributions reinvested). For the same period, the benchmark Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index rose +5.86%. The Fund's dividends from net investment
income during the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and Arizona
state personal income taxes.+ The Fund's performance includes two major
components: tax-free dividend income as well as capital appreciation driven
primarily by modestly declining interest rates during the period.

Q: CAN YOU DESCRIBE SOME ASPECTS OF THE ARIZONA
   MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET?
A: Over the past decade, growth has been driven by the high technology sector
and the relatively inexpensive cost of land and housing, in comparison to
Southern California. Standard & Poor's recently assigned an AA- rating to
Arizona, reflecting the state's declining tax collections and its low, but
increasing, debt burden.

Because of Arizona's reliance on the high technology industry, its economic
recovery has lagged the nation as a whole. That has led to relatively high
vacancies in commercial real estate projects, which in turn affected some bonds
in the portfolio. In one instance, a Ginnie Mae bond issued to finance apartment
complexes was called by the lender at par because vacancies in the project
exceeded a certain level. On the positive side, a number of bonds were "advance
refunded" by issuers seeking to take advantage of lower interest rates, which
effectively shortens the bonds' maturity, increases credit quality, and boosts
prices.

FLORIDA INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT FOR MUNICIPAL INVESTING DID
   YOU ENCOUNTER IN FLORIDA DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?
A: Florida maintained a strong economy during the past 12 months, thanks in
large part to the state's healthy tourism sector. Florida's unemployment rate
remained stable and below the national average. Florida's revenues, accumulated
primarily through sales taxes, were strong throughout the period, despite the
national recession. The state enjoyed a revenue surplus for the 2003 fiscal year
and was expected to see the same in 2004 (Source: Standard & Poor's). A strong
financial reserve fund added to Florida's fiscal strength. At period end, the
state's tax-secured general obligation debt had a credit rating of AA+ from
Standard & Poor's and a comparable Aa2 rating from Moody's. Both ratings
reflected the state's rising debt levels.

Florida, the nation's fifth-leading issuer of municipal debt in 2003, brought
$21 billion in new supply to market that year, representing a 14 percent
increase over the prior year's total. Issuance tailed off dramatically during
the first three months of 2004, however, as new supply fell more than 40 percent
compared to the first three months of 2003 (Source: The Bond Buyer).

Q: HOW DID THE FLORIDA INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND
   PERFORM DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?
A: For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2004, Florida Insured Municipal
Income Fund returned +5.59%* (shares at net asset value with distributions
reinvested). For the same period, Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund returned
+18.04% (shares at market price with distributions reinvested). During the same
period, the benchmark Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index gained +5.86%. The
Fund's dividends from net investment income during the year were exempt from
federal income and Florida intangible personal property taxes.+

The Fund's return at net asset value, which underperformed the Lehman Brothers
index, can be attributed to a short duration caused by having an overweighted
position in pre-refunded bonds. While these bonds provide desirable yield to the
portfolio, they do not benefit from price performance during a declining
interest rate environment.

Q: WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY IN MANAGING THE FUND?
A: We made relatively few changes to the portfolio during the reporting period.
With rates near historically low levels, we did not believe it was in the
shareholders' best interest to sell the Fund's older bonds issued during a more
attractive interest-rate environment. Doing so would have sacrificed yield as
well as resulted in taxable capital gains that would have passed through to
investors. With just over three percent of the Fund's assets maturing or called
from the portfolio during the period, turnover was very modest. As we mentioned,
this management strategy had a somewhat negative effect on the Fund's results
during the period. As bonds get closer to maturity, they become less sensitive
to declining interest rates. Since declining interest rates benefit bonds, the
Fund was not as well positioned to benefit as rates fell. However, we believe
that the portfolio's somewhat defensive stance will have a positive influence on
performance if interest rates do ultimately increase, as expected.

COLORADO INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: WHAT STRATEGIES WERE IMPLEMENTED DURING THE PERIOD?
A: The Fund is managed very conservatively in terms of "duration," a measure of
a bond fund's sensitivity to interest rate changes. The shorter the duration,
the less the bond fund's price will increase for a given decline in interest
rates. We maintained a shorter duration at a time when interest rates were
declining, which we believed was a prudent decision given the strengthening
economy. Typically, when the economy is recovering, interest rates rise as the
demand for credit intensifies and investors demand higher returns to compensate
for anticipated inflation.

In addition to its short duration, the Fund only holds AAA-rated insured bonds,
the highest possible quality. Issuers include education (Colorado State
University System), healthcare (North Colorado Medical Center), as well as a
number of bonds financing housing, water, and other utility projects. The Fund
contains no bonds that are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which
is significant because an increasing number of taxpayers are subject to the AMT.

<PAGE>


Q: HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?
A: During the 12-month period ended March 31, 2004, the Fund returned +8.05%*
(shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested). For the same period,
Colorado Municipal Income Fund returned +8.77% (shares at market price with
distributions reinvested). For the same period, the benchmark Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index rose +5.86%. The Fund's dividends from net investment
income during the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and Colorado
state personal income taxes.+

The Fund's performance included two major components: tax-free dividend income
as well as capital appreciation driven primarily by modestly declining interest
rates during the period. Since there are no other closed-end Colorado municipal
bond funds, the Lipper peer group to which it is compared is not truly an
"apples-to-apples" comparison, but serves as a general peer group comparison.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
this change for the period ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
investment income per share of $0.006, a decrease in net realized and unrealized
gain (loss) per share of $0.006, and an increase in the ratio of net investment
income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and ratios for periods
prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of each
period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for the
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in the
premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end
of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset value
will be lower than total investment return based on market value in periods
where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium of the
market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such
periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share
information.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
this change for the period ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
investment income per share of $0.007, a decrease in net realized and unrealized
gain (loss) per share of $0.007, and an increase in the ratio of net investment
income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and ratios for periods
prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of each
period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for the
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in the
premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end
of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset value
will be lower than total investment return based on market value in periods
where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium of the
market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such
periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share
information.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. This change in
accounting had no effect on the Fund's results of operations for the period
ended March 31, 2002. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to April
1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of each
period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for the
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in the
premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end
of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset value
will be lower than total investment return based on market value in periods
where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium of the
market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such
periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share
information.

                           March 31, 2004

NOTES
   TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal
Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc.
("Minnesota Municipal Fund II"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund III"); Delaware Investments Arizona
Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal Fund"), and Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund")
are organized as Minnesota corporations and Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund ("Florida Insured Municipal Fund") is organized as a
Massachusetts Business Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and collectively as
the "Funds"). The Minnesota Municipal Fund II, Florida Insured Municipal Fund
and Arizona Municipal Fund are diversified closed-end management investment
companies and Minnesota Municipal Fund, Minnesota Municipal Fund III and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund are non-diversified closed-end management
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Funds' shares trade on the American Stock Exchange.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide current income exempt from
federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and are consistently followed by the
Funds.

Security Valuation -- Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of the Funds' Board of
Trustees/Directors.

Federal Income Taxes -- Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Other -- Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of
Funds are allocated amongst the Funds on the basis of average net assets.
Management fees and other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions are
recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date). Costs
used in calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest
income over the lives of the respective securities. Each Fund declares and pays
dividends from net investment income monthly and distributions from net realized
gain on investments, if any, annually.

In order to satisfy certain distribution requirements of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, the Funds may declare special year-end dividend and capital gains
distributions during November or December to shareholders of record on a date in
such month. Such distributions, if received by shareholders by January 31, are
deemed to have been paid by the Funds and received by shareholders on the
earlier of the date paid or December 31 of the prior year.

Expenses Paid Indirectly -- Certain expenses of the Funds are paid through
commission arrangements with brokers. In addition, the Funds may receive
earnings credits from their custodian when positive cash balances are
maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. The expenses paid under the
above arrangements are included in their respective expense captions on the
Statements of Operations with the corresponding expense offset shown as
"expenses paid indirectly." The amounts of these expenses for the year ended
March 31, 2004 were as follows:

2. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
   WITH AFFILIATES
In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%
which is calculated daily based on the average daily net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

The Funds have engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc., (DSC), an affiliate of
DMC, to provide accounting and administration services which are based on
average net assets and paid on a monthly basis, subject to certain minimums.

At March 31, 2004, the Funds had liabilities payable to affiliates as follows:

Post-October losses represent losses realized on investment transactions from
November 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004 that, in accordance with federal income
tax regulations, the Funds have elected to defer and treat as having arisen in
the following fiscal year.

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts and distributions to
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the tax character of permanent book/tax
differences. For the year ended March 31, 2004, the Funds recorded the following
permanent reclassifications. Reclassifications are primarily due to tax
treatment of market discount on certain debt instruments and expiration of
capital loss carry forwards. Results of operations and net assets were not
affected by these reclassifications.

Colorado Insured Municipal Fund each have 200 million shares of $0.01 par value
common shares authorized. Florida Insured Municipal Fund has been authorized to
issue an unlimited amount of $0.01 par value common shares. The Funds did not

purchased by the Fund's transfer agent, Mellon Investor Services, LLC, in the
open market.

The Funds each have one million shares of $0.01 par value preferred shares
authorized, except for Florida Insured Municipal Fund, which has an unlimited
amount of $0.01 par value preferred shares authorized. Under resolutions adopted
by the Board of Directors/Trustees, Minnesota Municipal Fund is allowed to issue

5. CAPITAL STOCK (CONTINUED)
Dividends for the outstanding preferred shares of each Fund are cumulative at a
rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the year ended March 31, 2004 as
follows:


Fund                                                  Low                 High

Minnesota Municipal Fund                             0.89%      to        1.22%
Minnesota Municipal Fund II                          0.75%      to        1.25%
Minnesota Municipal Fund III                         0.80%      to        1.30%
Arizona Municipal Fund                               0.82%      to        1.12%
Florida Insured Municipal Fund                       0.80%      to        1.15%
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund                      0.65%      to        1.17%

Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.
(Colorado Insured Municipal Fund only), as the remarketing agents, receive an
annual fee from each of the Funds of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred
stock outstanding.

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class, would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant of Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS
The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the state, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels of
supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment for
their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.





<PAGE>

7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Funds enter into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

8. TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
The information set forth is for the Funds' fiscal year end as
required by federal laws. Shareholders, however, must report distributions on a
calendar year basis for income tax purposes, which may include distributions for
portions of two fiscal years of a fund. Accordingly, the information needed by
shareholders for income tax purposes was sent to them in early 2004. Please
consult your tax advisor for proper treatment of this information.

For the year ended March 31, 2004, each Fund designates as long-term capital
gains, ordinary income, and tax-exempt income distributions paid during the year
as follows:

(a) For the year ended March 31, 2004, certain long-term capital gains
distributions paid by the Funds may be subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%, as
provided by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund, Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured Municipal
Income Fund, and Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund designated $307,077,
$178,521, $53,008, and $115,296, respectively, to be taxed at a maximum rate of
15%. Complete information was computed and reported in conjunction with your

Item 2.  Code of Ethics

         The registrant has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the
registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or a
third party. A copy of the registrant's Code of Business Ethics has been posted
on Delaware Investments' internet website at www.delawareinvestments.com. Any
amendments to the Code of Business Ethics, and information on any waiver from
its provisions granted by the registrant, will also be posted on this website
within five business days of such amendment or waiver and will remain on the
website for at least 12 months.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert

         The registrant's Board of Trustees/Directors has determined that each
member of the registrant's Audit Committee is an audit committee financial
expert, as defined below. For purposes of this item, an "audit committee
financial expert" is a person who has the following attributes:

         a. An understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and
financial statements;

         b. The ability to assess the general application of such principles in
connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves;

         c. Experience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial
statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues
that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can
reasonably be expected to be raised by the registrant's financial statements, or
experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities;

         d. An understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting; and

         e. An understanding of audit committee functions.

An "audit committee financial expert" shall have acquired such attributes
through:

         a. Education and experience as a principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer, controller, public accountant, or auditor or experience in
one or more positions that involve the performance of similar functions;

         b. Experience actively supervising a principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant, auditor, or person
performing similar functions;





<PAGE>

         c. Experience overseeing or assessing the performance of companies or
public accountants with respect to the preparation, auditing, or evaluation of
financial statements; or

         d. Other relevant experience.

         The registrant's Board of Trustees/Directors has also determined that
each member of the registrant's Audit Committee is independent. In order to be
"independent" for purposes of this item, the Audit Committee member may not: (i)
other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board of Trustees/Directors
or any committee thereof, accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory
or other compensatory fee from the issuer; or (ii) be an "interested person" of
the registrant as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of
1940.

         The names of the audit committee financial experts on the registrant's
Audit Committee are set forth below:

         Ann R. Leven
         Thomas F. Madison
         Janet L. Yeomans(1)

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services

         (a) Audit fees.

         The aggregate fees billed for services provided to the Registrant by
its independent auditors for the audit of the Registrant's annual financial

connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $16,950
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.

         The aggregate fees billed for services provided to the Registrant by
its independent auditors for the audit of the Registrant's annual financial

- -----------------------
(1) The instructions to Form N-CSR require disclosure on the relevant experience
of persons who qualify as audit committee financial experts based on "other
relevant experience." The Board of Trustees/Directors has determined that Ms.
Yeomans qualifies as an audit committee financial expert by virtue of her
education and experience as the Treasurer of a large global corporation.



<PAGE>

         (b) Audit-related fees.

         The aggregate fees billed by the Registrant's independent auditors for

services approved by the Registrant's Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis
exception from the pre-approval requirement in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of
Regulation S-X was 0%. These audit-related services were as follows: quarterly
agreed-upon procedures with respect to the preferred stock rating agency

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

Item 6.  [Reserved]

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies

         The registrant has formally delegated to its investment adviser(s)
(including any sub-adviser) (the "Adviser") the ability to make all proxy voting
decisions in relation to portfolio securities held by the registrant. If and
when proxies need to be voted on behalf of the registrant, the Adviser will vote
such proxies pursuant to its Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures (the
"Procedures"). The Adviser has established a Proxy Voting Committee (the
"Committee") which is responsible for overseeing the Adviser's proxy voting
process for the registrant. One of the main responsibilities of the Committee is
to review and approve the Procedures to ensure that the Procedures are designed
to allow the Adviser to vote proxies in a manner consistent with the goal of
voting in the best interests of the registrant.

         In order to facilitate the actual process of voting proxies, the
Adviser has contracted with Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") to
analyze proxy statements on behalf of the registrant and other Adviser clients
and vote proxies generally in accordance with the Procedures. The Committee is
responsible for overseeing ISS's proxy voting activities. If a proxy has been
voted for the registrant, ISS will create a record of the vote. Beginning no
later than August 31, 2004, information (if any) regarding how the registrant
voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month
period ended June 30 is available without charge (i) through the registrant's
website at http://www.delawareinvestments.com; and (ii) on the Commission's
website at http://www.sec.gov.

         The Procedures contain a general guideline that recommendations of
company management on an issue (particularly routine issues) should be given a
fair amount of weight in determining how proxy issues should be voted. However,
the Adviser will normally vote against management's position when it runs
counter to its specific Proxy Voting Guidelines (the "Guidelines"), and the
Adviser will also vote against management's recommendation when it believes that
such position is not in the best interests of the registrant.

         As stated above, the Procedures also list specific Guidelines on how to
vote proxies on behalf of the registrant. Some examples of the Guidelines are as
follows: (i) generally vote for shareholder proposals asking that a majority or
more of directors be independent; (ii) generally vote against proposals to
require a supermajority shareholder vote; (iii) votes on mergers and
acquisitions should be considered on a case-by-case basis, determining whether
the transaction enhances shareholder value; (iv) generally vote against
proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior voting rights; (v)
generally vote re-incorporation proposals on a case-by-case basis; (vi) votes
with respect to management compensation plans are generally determined on a
case-by-case basis; (vii) generally vote for reports on the level of greenhouse
gas emissions from a company's operations and products; and (viii) generally
vote for proposals requesting the company to report on its policies and
practices related to social, environmental and economic sustainability.



<PAGE>

         Because the registrant has delegated proxy voting to the Adviser, the
registrant is not expected to encounter any conflict of interest issues
regarding proxy voting and therefore does not have procedures regarding this
matter. However, the Adviser does have a section in its Procedures that
addresses the possibility of conflicts of interest. Most proxies which the
Adviser receives on behalf of the registrant are voted by ISS in accordance with
the Procedures. Because almost all registrant proxies are voted by ISS pursuant
to the pre-determined Procedures, it normally will not be necessary for the
Adviser to make an actual determination of how to vote a particular proxy,
thereby largely eliminating conflicts of interest for the Adviser during the
proxy voting process. In the very limited instances where the Adviser is
considering voting a proxy contrary to ISS's recommendation, the Committee will
first assess the issue to see if there is any possible conflict of interest
involving the Adviser or affiliated persons of the Adviser. If a member of the
Committee has actual knowledge of a conflict of interest, the Committee will
normally use another independent third party to do additional research on the
particular proxy issue in order to make a recommendation to the Committee on how
to vote the proxy in the best interests of the registrant. The Committee will
then review the proxy voting materials and recommendation provided by ISS and
the independent third party to determine how to vote the issue in a manner which
the Committee believes is consistent with the Procedures and in the best
interests of the registrant.

affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
