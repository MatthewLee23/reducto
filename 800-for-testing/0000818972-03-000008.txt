LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear    Shareholder:

This  annual  report  for Dreyfus Strategic Municipals, Inc. covers the 12-month
period  from  October  1,  2002, through September 30, 2003. Inside, you'll find
valuable information about how the fund was managed during the reporting period,
including a discussion with the fund's portfolio manager, W. Michael Petty.

After a prolonged period of sluggish growth, the U.S. economy has shown signs of
sustainable improvement. However, investor uncertainty regarding the strength of
the  recovery  has produced heightened volatility in the tax-exempt fixed-income
market. After most areas of the municipal bond market experienced sharp declines
during   the   summer,   prices   generally   bounced   back   in   September.

Despite  recent reductions in federal tax rates, we believe that municipal bonds
may  become  more  attractive  to certain investors if states and municipalities
continue to raise taxes to balance their budgets. As always, we encourage you to
talk  with your financial advisor about ways to enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt
municipal bonds as market conditions evolve.

Thank you for your continued confidence and support.

Sincerely,


Stephen E. Canter
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Dreyfus Corporation

October 15, 2003




DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

W. Michael Petty, Portfolio Manager

How did Dreyfus Strategic Municipals, Inc. perform during the period?

For  the  12-month  period  ended  September 30, 2003, the fund achieved a total
return  of 5.49%.(1) Over the same period, the fund provided income dividends of
$0.7200 per share, which is equal to a distribution rate of 7.68%.(2)

We  attribute  the fund's performance primarily to falling interest rates during
the  first  nine  months  of  the  reporting  period and the recovery of certain
corporate-backed  holdings  that  bounced  back  strongly  from  depressed price
levels. In addition, the fund performed well during the summer of 2003, when our
efforts  to  improve its overall credit quality proved beneficial during a brief
but intense period of heightened market volatility.

What is the fund's investment approach?

The  fund' s  investment  objective  is  to  maximize current income exempt from
federal  income  tax  to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital.
Under  normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets
in  municipal  obligations.  Generally, the fund invests at least 50% of its net
assets  in municipal bonds considered investment-grade or the unrated equivalent
as  determined  by  Dreyfus  in the case of bonds, and in the two highest-rating
categories  or  the  unrated  equivalent as determined by Dreyfus in the case of
short-term  obligations  having  or  deemed  to have maturities of less than one
year.

To  this  end, we have constructed the portfolio by seeking income opportunities
through  analysis  of each bond's structure, including paying close attention to
each bond's yield, maturity and early redemption features.

Over  time,  many  of  the fund's relatively higher-yielding bonds mature or are
redeemed  by  their  issuers,  and  we  generally  attempt  to replace them with
securities   at   then-prevailing   yields,   which   may  be  lower   The  Fun


DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED)

than  the rates of the securities which mature or are redeemed.  When we believe
an  opportunity  exists, we also may seek to upgrade the portfolio's investments
with  newly  issued bonds that, in our opinion, have better structural or income
characteristics    than    existing    holdings.

What other factors influenced the fund's performance?

The  fund  was influenced by general market trends, including declining interest
rates  during  the  first  half  of  the  reporting period and heightened market
volatility  as  investor  sentiment  shifted in the second half of the reporting
period.

When  the  reporting  period began, the nation was mired in economic weakness as
2002' s  corporate  scandals,  a  persistently declining stock market and rising
geopolitical  tensions  took  their  toll  on  business  and  consumer spending.
Investors  generally  remained risk averse in this unsettled climate, which hurt
prices of riskier assets, such as stocks and lower-rated corporate-backed bonds.
Some  of the fund's corporate-backed holdings, including tax-exempt bonds issued
by  financially  troubled  airlines,  were  hit particularly hard, hindering the
fund's returns.

Toward  the  end  of  2002,  after the Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") reduced
short-term interest rates by 50 basis points, investors apparently began to grow
more  comfortable  with  credit  risk,  and the prices of corporate-backed bonds
bounced  back  strongly.  We  took  advantage  of the rally to reduce the fund's
corporate  exposure,  and  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  the  fund's
airline-related  holdings were limited to small positions in two major carriers.
As  a  result, the fund's overall average credit rating improved from the top of
the single-A range to the bottom of the double-A range.

The  fund also benefited from its average duration, which we maintained for much
of  the  reporting period in a range we considered slightly longer than average.
Despite   rising  expectations  of  stronger  economic  growth,  interest  rates
continued  to decline during the spring of 2003 as investors anticipated another
rate-cut    by    the    Fed,    which

occurred  in  late  June.  The fund's longer than average duration enabled it to
lock in higher then-prevailing yields for a longer time and capture the benefits
of capital appreciation while interest rates fell.

The  fund  also  received good results from its leveraging strategy. In February
2003,  we  extended  the term of one series of the fund's auction-rate preferred
notes  to  two  years,  locking in low borrowing costs on money used to purchase
additional securities.

What is the fund's current strategy?

During  the  summer of 2003, we adopted a more defensive posture by reducing the
fund's average duration to a range we consider slightly shorter than average. In
addition, we continued our efforts to improve the fund's overall credit quality.
These  measures helped the fund during a sharp market reversal in July, when the
municipal  bond  market suffered the worst one-month decline in its history. The
market's volatility was caused by investors' reactions to stronger than expected
economic data, which raised concerns that inflationary pressures might reemerge.
The  bond  market  bounced  back  at  a  more  moderate  pace in late August and
September, erasing most of July's losses.

In   addition,   when   making  new  purchases,  we  recently  have  focused  on
income-oriented  securities  with  maturities  in  the  10- to 15-year range. We
believe  that  these  relatively  defensive securities should hold more of their
intrinsic value if interest rates begin to rise and bond prices decline.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--Significant Accounting Policies:

Dreyfus  Strategic  Municipals,  Inc.  (the  "fund" ) is  registered  under  the
Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end  management investment company. The fund's investment objective is to
maximize  current income exempt from federal income tax to the extent consistent
with the preservation of capital. The Dreyfus Corporation (the "Manager") serves
as  the  fund' s investment adviser. The Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Mellon  Bank,  N.A.,  which  is  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Mellon Financial
Corporation. The fund's Common Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol LEO.

The fund has outstanding 2,280 shares of Series M, Series T, Series W, Series TH
and  Series  F  for a total of 11,400 shares of Auction Preferred Stock ("APS"),
with  a  liquidation  preference  of  $25,000 per share (plus an amount equal to
accumulated  but  unpaid  dividends  upon  liquidation) . APS dividend rates are
determined  pursuant  to periodic auctions. Deutsche Bank Trust Company America,
as  Auction  Agent,  receives a fee from the fund for its services in connection
with  such  auctions.  The  fund also compensates broker-dealers generally at an
annual  rate  of  .25%  of the purchase price of the shares of APS placed by the
broker-dealer in an auction.

The  fund  is  subject  to  certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply  with  these  restrictions  could  preclude  the  fund from declaring any
distributions  to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The  holders  of the APS, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect at
least  two  directors.  The  holders of the APS will vote as a separate class on
certain  other  matters,  as  required  by law. The fund has designated Robin R.
Pringle  and John E. Zuccotti to represent holders of APS on the fund's Board of
Directors.

The  fund' s  financial  statements  are  prepared in accordance with accounting
principles   generally   accepted   in   the  United  States,  which   The  Fun

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

may  require  the  use  of  management estimates and assumptions. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

(a)  Portfolio  valuation:  Investments  in municipal debt securities (excluding
options  and  financial  futures  on municipal and U.S. Treasury securities) are
valued on the last business day of each week and month by an independent pricing
service  (the  "Service" ) approved  by  the Board of Directors. Investments for
which  quoted bid prices are readily available and are representative of the bid
side of the market in the judgment of the Service are valued at the mean between
the  quoted  bid  prices  (as  obtained  by  the  Service  from  dealers in such
securities)  and  asked  prices  (as  calculated  by  the Service based upon its
evaluation  of  the  market  for  such  securities) . Other  investments  (which
constitute  a majority of the portfolio securities) are carried at fair value as
determined  by  the  Service,  based  on methods which include consideration of:
yields or prices of municipal securities of comparable quality, coupon, maturity
and  type; indications as to values from dealers; and general market conditions.
Options  and  financial  futures  on  municipal and U.S. Treasury securities are
valued  at  the  last  sales  price  on  the  securities  exchange on which such
securities  are  primarily  traded  or  at  the last sales price on the national
securities market on the last business day of each week and month.

(b)  Securities  transactions and investment income: Securities transactions are
recorded  on  a  trade  date  basis.  Realized  gain  and  loss  from securities
transactions  are  recorded  on  the  identified  cost  basis.  Interest income,
adjusted for amortization of discount and premium on investments, is earned from
settlement  date  and  recognized  on the accrual basis. Securities purchased or
sold  on  a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be settled a month or more
after the trade date.

(c)  Dividends  to  shareholders  of  Common  Stock  (" Common  Shareholders(s):
Dividends  are  recorded  on  the  ex-dividend  date.  Dividends from investment
income-net  are  declared  and paid monthly. Dividends from net realized capital
gain,  if  any,  are  normally declared and paid annually, but the fund may make
distributions  on a more frequent basis to comply with distribution requirements
of    the    Internal

Revenue  Code  of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). To the extent that net realized
capital  gain  can be offset by capital loss carryovers, it is the policy of the
fund  not  to  distribute  such  gain. Income and capital gain distributions are
determined  in  accordance  with  income  tax regulations, which may differ from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

For  Common  Shareholders who elect to receive their distributions in additional
shares  of  the  fund, in lieu of cash, such distributions will be reinvested at
the  lower  of  the market price or net asset value per share (but not less than
95%  of  the  market  price)  as  defined  in the dividend reinvestment and cash
purchase plan.

On  September  30, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.06
per  share  from  investment  income-net,  payable on October 29, 2003 to Common
Shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 15, 2003.

(d)  Dividends  to  shareholders  of APS: For APS, dividends are currently reset
every  7  days  for  Series Th. The dividend rate for Series M will be in effect
until  November  8, 2004. The dividend rate for Series T will be in effect until
July  20,  2004. The dividend rate for Series W will be in effect until December
3,  2003.  The  dividend  rate for Series F will be in effect until February 13,
2005. The dividend rates in effect at September 30, 2003 were as follows: Series
M-1.40%, Series T-1.07%, Series W-1.65%, Series TH-.90% and Series F-1.64%.

(e) Federal income taxes: It is the policy of the fund to continue to qualify as
a  regulated  investment  company, which can distribute tax exempt dividends, by
complying  with  the applicable provisions of the Code and to make distributions
of  income  and  net  realized  capital  gain  sufficient  to  relieve  it  from
substantially all federal income and excise taxes.

At  September  30,  2003,  the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis
were as follows: undistributed tax exempt income $6,055,850, accumulated capital
losses  $30,487,747  and  unrealized  appreciation $33,346,093. In addition, the
fund    had    $25,972,240    of    capital    losses    real    The    Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

ized  after  October 31, 2002, which were deferred for tax purposes to the first
day of the following fiscal year.

The accumulated capital loss carryover is available to be applied against future
net  securities  profits,  if any, realized subsequent to September 30, 2003. If
not applied, $9,836,505 of the carryover expires in fiscal 2009, $76,128 expires
in fiscal 2010 and $20,575,114 expires in fiscal 2011.

The  tax  character  of  distributions  paid  to  shareholders during the fiscal
periods  ended  September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, respectively, were as
follows: tax exempt income of $47,191,937 and $43,989,948.

During the period ended September 30, 2003, as a result of permanent book to tax
differences,  the fund decreased accumulated undistributed investment income-net
by  $163,336,  increased  accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments by
$106,706  and increased paid-in capital by $56,630. Net assets were not affected
by this reclassification.

NOTE 2--Bank Line of Credit:

The  fund  participates  with  other  Dreyfus-managed  funds  in  a $100 million
unsecured  line  of  credit  primarily to be utilized for temporary or emergency
purposes.  Interest  is  charged to the fund based on prevailing market rates in
effect  at  the  time of borrowings. During the period ended September 30, 2003,
the fund did not borrow under the line of credit.

NOTE 3--Management Fee and Other Transactions With Affiliates:

(a)  Pursuant  to  a  management  agreement  ("Agreement") with the Manager, the
management  fee  is computed at the annual rate of .75 of 1% of the value of the
fund's average weekly net assets, inclusive of the outstanding auction preferred
stock,   and   is  payable  monthly.  The  Agreement  provides  for  an  expense
reimbursement  from  the Manager should the fund's aggregate expenses, exclusive
of  taxes,  interest on borrowings, brokerage and extraordinary expenses, in any
full  fiscal  year  exceed the lesser of (1) the expense limitation of any state
having  jurisdiction over the fund or (2) 2% of the first $10 million, 1 1_2% of
the  next  $20  million  and  1%  of  the excess over $30 million of the averag

value  of  the  fund' s  net assets. During the period ended September 30, 2003,
there was no expense reimbursement pursuant to the Agreement.

(b)  The fund compensates Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, an affiliate of
the  Manager,  under a custody agreement for providing custodial services to the
fund. During the period ended September 30, 2003, $140,593 was charged by Boston
Safe Deposit and Trust Company pursuant to the custody agreement.

(c)  Through  January  27,  2003,  each  Board  member who is not an "affiliated
person"  as  defined in the Act received from the fund an annual fee at the rate
of $4,500 and an attendance fee of $500 per meeting. Each such Board member also
serves   as   a   Board  member  of  other  Funds  within  the  Dreyfus  complex
(collectively, the "Fund Group"). After January 27, 2003, Board compensation was
changed  from  a "Fund by Fund" basis to a "Fund Group" basis; this compensation
arrangement  effectively  allocates  the  fees  among  the funds in the group in
proportion to each fund's relative net assets. Aggregate fees paid to each Board
member  with respect to the period ended September 30, 2003 were $4,373, with an
average  attendance  fee per meeting of $534. The Chairman of the Board receives
an  additional  25% of such compensation. Subject to the fund's Emeritus Program
Guidelines,  Emeritus  Board members, if any, receive 50% of the annual retainer
fee  and  per  meeting  fee  paid at the time the Board member achieves emeritus
status.

NOTE 4--Securities Transactions:

The  aggregate amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term  securities,  during the period ended September 30, 2003, amounted to
$443,627,807 and $438,353,567, respectively.

At  September  30, 2003, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes
was  $788,204,797;  accordingly,  accumulated  net  unrealized  appreciation  on
investments   was   $33,346,093,  consisting  of  $43,329,682  gross  unrealized
appreciation    and    $9,983,589    gross    unrealized    depreciation.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan

Under  the  fund' s Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"), a
holder  of Common Stock who has fund shares registered in his name will have all
dividends and distributions reinvested automatically by The Bank of New York, as
Plan  agent  (the  "Agent" ), in  additional  shares of the fund at the lower of
prevailing  market  price  or  net  asset value (but not less than 95% of market
value  at  the time of valuation) unless such shareholder elects to receive cash
as  provided  below.  If  market  price  is equal to or exceeds net asset value,
shares  will  be  issued  at  net asset value. If net asset value exceeds market
price  or  if a cash dividend only is declared, the Agent, as agent for the Plan
participants, will buy fund shares in the open market. A Plan participant is not
relieved   of  any  income  tax  that  may  be  payable  on  such  dividends  or
distributions.

A Common Shareholder who owns fund shares registered in nominee name through his
broker/dealer  (i.e., in "street name") may not participate in the Plan, but may
elect  to  have cash dividends and distributions reinvested by his broker/dealer
in   additional  shares  of  the  fund  if  such  service  is  provided  by  the
broker/dealer;  otherwise  such dividends and distributions will be treated like
any other cash dividend.

A  Common  Shareholder  who  has fund shares registered in his name may elect to
withdraw  from the Plan at any time for a $2.50 fee and thereby elect to receive
cash  in  lieu  of  shares of the fund. Changes in elections must be in writing,
sent  to  The Bank of New York, Dividend Reinvestment Department, P.O. Box 1958,
Newark, New Jersey 07101-9774, should include the shareholder's name and address
as  they  appear  on  the Agent's records and will be effective only if received
more than fifteen days prior to the record date for any distribution.

A  Plan  participant  who  has  fund shares in his name has the option of making
additional  cash payments to the Agent, semi-annually, in any amount from $1,000
to  $10,000,  for investment in the fund's shares in the open market on or about
January  15  and July 15. Any voluntary cash payments received more than 30 days
prior    to    these    dates    will    be     The    Fund

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)

returned  by  the  Agent,  and  interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payments. A participant may withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written notice,
if the notice is received by the Agent not less than 48 hours before the payment
is  to  be  invested.  A  Common  Shareholder who owns fund shares registered in
street  name should consult his broker/dealer to determine whether an additional
cash purchase option is available through his broker/dealer.

The  Agent  maintains  all Common Shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in the accounts. Shares in the account
of  each  Plan participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificated form in
the  name  of  the  participant,  and each such participant's proxy will include
those shares purchased pursuant to the Plan.

The  fund  pays the Agent's fee for reinvestment of dividends and distributions.
Plan  participants  pay  a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect  to  the Agent's open market purchases and purchases from voluntary cash
payments, and a $1.25 fee for each purchase made from a voluntary cash payment.

The  fund  reserves  the  right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
notice  of  the  change  sent  to  Plan participants at least 90 days before the
record  date  for such dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated   by  the  Agent  on  at  least  90  days'  written  notice  to  Plan
participants.

Managed Dividend Policy

The  fund' s  dividend  policy  is  to  distribute  substantially all of its net
investment  income  to  its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more consistent yield to the current trading price of shares
of  Common Stock of the fund, the fund may at times pay out less than the entire
amount  of net investment income earned in any particular month and may at times
in  any  month  pay out such accumulated but undistributed income in addition to
net  investment  income earned in that month. As a result, the dividends paid b

the  fund  for  any  particular month may be more or less than the amount of net
investment  income  earned  by  the  fund  during such month. The fund's current
accumulated but undistributed net investment income, if any, is disclosed in the
Statement  of  Assets  and  Liabilities,  which  comprises part of the Financial
Information included in this report.

Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

The  fund  utilizes leverage to seek to enhance the yield and net asset value of
its  Common  Stock.  These  objectives  cannot  be achieved in all interest rate
environments. To leverage, the fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends
at  prevailing  short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal  bonds.  The  interest  earned  on these investments is paid to Common
Shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings
is  reflected  in  the  per share net asset value of the fund's Common Stock. In
order to benefit Common Shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped:
that  is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At  the  same  time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common  Shareholders.  If  either  of  these conditions change, then the risk of
leveraging    will    begin    to    outweigh    the    benefits.

Supplemental Information

During the period ended September 30, 2003, shareholders approved changes in the
fund' s  fundamental  investment  policies  to permit the fund to engage in swap
transactions  and to invest in other investment companies. Otherwise, during the
period  ended,  there  were:  (i)  no  material changes in the fund's investment
objective  or  policies,  (ii)  no changes in the fund's charter or by-laws that
would  delay  or  prevent a change of control of the fund, and (iii) no material
changes in the principal risk factors associated with investment in the fund. In
addition,  on  November  1,  2002,  W.  Michael Petty was assigned as the person
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund's portfolio.

tax)   .

As  required by federal tax law rules, shareholders will receive notification of

                           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



1.    Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

     This code of ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
complex (each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or Controller, or
other persons performing similar functions, each of whom is listed on Exhibit A
(the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

o      honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
       apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
       relationships;

o      full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and
       Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications made
       by the Fund;

o      compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o      the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

2. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts
   of Interest


     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of the Fund and the Fund's
investment adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and the circumstances they
cover fall outside of the parameters of the Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board that
the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes of ethics.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that the Code
cannot enumerate every possible scenario. The overarching principle of the Code
is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must:

o       not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
        influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
        whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
        of the Fund;

o       not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
        individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
        benefit of the Fund; and

o       not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
        potential violations that are made in good faith.

3.    Disclosure and Compliance

o       Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
        requirements generally applicable to the Fund within his area of
        responsibility;

o       each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
        to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
        outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members and auditors,
        and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations; and

o       each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
        of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fund
        and the Adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely
        and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund
        files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications
        made by the Fund; and

o       it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
        with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
        and regulations.

4.    Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

o       upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon becoming a
        Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
        read, and understands the Code;

o       annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
        requirements of the Code; and

o       notify the Adviser's General Counsel (the "General Counsel") promptly if
        he knows of any violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a
        violation of the Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by any
Covered Officer will be considered by the Fund's Board.

     The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing the
Code:

o       the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
        potential violations reported to him;

o       if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
        violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any
        further action;

o       any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
        reported to the Board;

o       if the Board concurs that a violation has occurred, it will consider
        appropriate action, which may include: review of, and appropriate
        modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
        appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or dismissal of the
        Covered Officer;

o       the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

o       any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required, will
        be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

5.    Other Policies and Procedures

     The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. The Fund's, its
principal underwriter's and the Adviser's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under
the Investment Company Act and the Adviser's additional policies and procedures,
including its Code of Conduct, are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

6.    Amendments

     The Code may not be amended except in written form which is specifically
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Fund's Board, including a
majority of independent Board members.

7.    Confidentiality

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will be
considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and their counsel, the
appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel and the Adviser.

8.    Internal Use

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

Dated as of:   JULY 1, 2003
