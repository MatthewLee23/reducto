The Fund
   Western Asset/Claymore U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Fund
("WIA" or the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified management investment
company which seeks to provide current income for its shareholders. Capital
appreciation, when consistent with current income, is a secondary investment
objective. Substantially all of the net investment income is distributed to the
shareholders. A Dividend Reinvestment Plan is available to those shareholders
of record desiring it. The shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
where they are traded under the symbol WIA.

Investment Policies
   The Fund's investment policies include, among others, that its portfolio be
invested as follows:

   .  At least 80% of total managed assets in U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected
      Securities.

   .  Up to 20% of total managed assets in corporate bonds or other securities
      and instruments.

   .  Preferred shares, together with other forms of leverage (including
      reverse repurchase agreements and dollar roll transactions), will not
      exceed 38% of the Fund's total managed assets.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
   The Fund and EquiServe Trust Company N.A. ("Agent"), as the Transfer Agent
and Registrar of WIA, offer a convenient way to add shares of WIA to your
account. WIA offers to all common shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan
("Plan"). Under the Plan, cash distributions (e.g., dividends and capital
gains) on the common shares are automatically invested in shares of WIA unless
the shareholder elects otherwise.

   As a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, you will automatically
receive your dividend or net capital gains distribution in newly issued shares
of WIA, if the market price of the shares on the date of the distribution is at
or above the net asset value ("NAV") of the shares, minus estimated brokerage
commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of common shares on the
open market. The number of shares to be issued to you will be determined by
dividing the amount of the cash distribution to which you are entitled (net of
any applicable withholding taxes) by the greater of the NAV per share on such
date or 95% of the market price of a share on such date. If the market price of
a share on such distribution date is below the NAV, minus estimated brokerage
commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of common shares on the
open market, the Agent will, as agent for the participants, buy shares of WIA
through a broker on the open market. All common shares acquired on your behalf
through the Plan will be automatically credited to an account maintained on the
books of the Agent.

Additional Information Regarding the Plan
   WIA will pay all costs applicable to the Plan, with the exceptions noted
below. Brokerage commissions for open market purchases by the Agent under the
Plan will be charged to participants. All shares acquired through the Plan
receive voting rights and are eligible for any stock split, stock dividend, or
other rights accruing to shareholders that the Board of Trustees may declare.

   You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time by giving written
notice to the Agent. Such termination shall be effective prior to the record
date next succeeding the receipt of such instructions or by a later date of
termination specified in such instructions. Upon termination, a participant may
request a certificate for the full shares credited to his or her account or may
request the sale of all or part of such shares. Fractional shares credited to a
terminating account will be paid for in cash at the current market price at the
time of termination.

                                      1

Annual Report to Shareholders

   Dividends and other distributions invested in additional shares under the
Plan are subject to income tax just as if they had been received in cash. After
year end, dividends paid on the accumulated shares will be included in the Form
1099-DIV information return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and only one
Form 1099-DIV will be sent to participants each year.

   Inquiries regarding the Plan, as well as notices of termination, should be
directed to EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43011, Providence, Rhode
Island 02940-3011--Investor Relations telephone number (800) 426-5523.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
   You may request a free description of the policies and procedures that the
Fund uses to determine how proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio securities
are voted by calling 1-800-345-7999 or by writing to the Fund, or you may

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE


General Market Performance
   The U.S. economy continued to display impressive signs of strength in the
fourth quarter of 2003. Although the pace of retail sales appears to have
cooled a bit since the third quarter, manufacturing and housing remained quite
strong and the labor market continued to firm. Good economic news, coupled with
strong productivity and improving earnings, helped drive equity prices higher.
Inflation pressures continued to increase in December as the dollar fell, gold
rose, commodities surged, and oil prices edged higher. Despite signs of
stronger economic activity and rising prices, headline and core CPI inflation
registered declines in November, and bond yields declined modestly.

   With economic news still strong but not blazing strong, and with the Fed
continuing to insist that a tightening is far out on the horizon, intermediate
nominal yields fell 20 basis points/A/ ("bps") or so, while long-term yields
fell by only 5 bps. This same pattern--a modest steepening of the yield
curve--was repeated in the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities ("TIPS")
market as real yields also declined. Breakeven spreads were little changed for
December, although they hovered near relatively high levels as inflation
concerns continued to manifest themselves. TIPS received a tiny negative
inflation adjustment for the month, repeating what appears to be a regular
seasonal pattern.

Fund Performance
   The Fund recorded a total return, based on market value per share, of +1.58%
since its inception. During this time period, the stock price has remained
stable in a range from $14.92 to $15.70. Since the Fund began on September 30,
2003, there have been three common dividends declared and two paid. No
Preferred Dividends were recorded as of 12/31/03. The next common dividend pay
date is January 9, 2004.

   The pie chart above represents the Fund's portfolio as of December 31, 2003.
The Fund's portfolio is actively managed, and its portfolio composition, credit
quality breakdown, and other portfolio characteristics will vary from time to
time. U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are unrated, but are backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States and are therefore considered
by the Fund's investment adviser to be comparable to bonds rated AAA/Aaa.

Annual Report to Shareholders

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in Thousands)

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

   Western Asset/Claymore U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Fund
(the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940
Act"), as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
The Fund commenced operations on September 30, 2003.

   The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide current income for its
shareholders. Capital appreciation, when consistent with current income, is a
secondary investment objective.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by
the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

Security Valuation

   Securities owned by the Fund for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at current market value. Current market value means the
last sale price of the day or, in the absence of any such sales, the bid price
obtained from quotation reporting systems, pricing services or other approved
methods. Other assets and securities for which no quotations are readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Trustees or persons acting under their supervision. The factors considered in
making such valuations are subject to change over time and are reviewed
periodically. The values assigned to fair valued investments are based on
available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might
ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future developments
inherent in long-term investments. Further, because of the inherent uncertainty
of valuation, such estimated values may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and
the differences could be material. Securities with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are generally valued at a readily available market price or, if a
market price is not readily available, fair valued at amortized cost.

   Where a security is traded on more than one market, the securities are
generally valued on the market considered by the Fund's adviser to be the
primary market.

Security Transactions

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from security transactions are reported on an identified cost basis for
both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

   Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term
investments, U.S. government securities and U.S. government agencies)
aggregated $90,803 and $0, respectively, for the period ended December 31,
2003. Purchases and sales of U.S. government and government agency obligations
were $509,399 and $12,650, respectively, for the period December 31, 2003.

Repurchase Agreements

   The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of
a typical repurchase agreement, a fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and a fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining
the yield during a fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed
rate of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the fund's
holding period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to
the total amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event
of counterparty default, a fund has the right to use the collateral to satisfy
the terms of the repurchase agreement. However, there could be potential loss
to the fund in the event the fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its
right to dispose of the collateral securities, including the risk of a possible
decline in the value of the collateral securities during the period in which
the fund seeks to assert its rights. The Fund's investment adviser reviews the
value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers
with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to evaluate potential
risks.

                                      14




Options, Futures and Swap Agreements

 The current market value of an exchange traded option is the last sale price
or, in the absence of a sale, the price obtained by reference to broker-dealer
quotations. Futures contracts are valued daily at the settlement price
established by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Futures
contracts are marked-to-market on a daily basis. As the contract's value
fluctuates, payments known as variation margin are made to or received from the
futures commission merchant. Swap agreements are priced daily based upon
quotations from brokers and the change, if any, is recorded as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation.

Short Sales

   The Fund may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline in
the market price of that security. The Fund must then borrow the security sold
short and deliver it to the dealer that brokered the short sale. A gain,
limited to the price at which the security was sold short, or a loss,
potentially unlimited in size, will be recognized upon the termination of the
short sale. With respect to each short sale, the Fund must maintain collateral
in a segregated account consisting of liquid assets with a value at least equal
to the current market value of the shorted securities, marked-to-market daily,
or take other actions permitted by law to cover its obligations. Dividend
expenses and fees paid to brokers to borrow securities in connection with short
sales are considered part of the cost of short sale transactions.

Distributions to Common Shareholders

 Net investment income for dividend purposes is recorded on the accrual basis
and consists of interest and dividends less expenses. All premiums and
discounts are amortized for financial reporting and tax purposes using the
effective interest method over the period to maturity of the security, and
serve to reduce or increase interest income. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividends from net investment income are paid monthly.
Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which
may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America; accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the Fund's
capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution under
tax regulations.

Use of Estimates

   The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

2. Federal Income Taxes:

   No provision for federal income or excise taxes is required since the Fund
intends to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute
substantially all of its taxable income and capital gain to its shareholders.
Because federal income tax regulations differ from accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, income and capital gain
distributions determined in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net
investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting
purposes. Accordingly, the character of distributions and composition of net
assets for tax purposes differs from those reflected in the accompanying
financial statements.

   Distributions of $4,656 during the year ended December 31, 2003, were
characterized as ordinary income. No capital gain distributions were paid
during the year ended December 31, 2003.

   Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to investment
companies, the Fund has elected to treat net capital losses realized between
November 1 and December 31 of each year ("post-October loss") as occurring on
the first day of the following tax year. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
realized capital and currency losses reflected in the accompanying financial
statements, which will not be recognized for federal income tax purposes until
2004, are shown in the table below.

</TABLE>

   The difference between book and tax basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) is primarily due to the tax deferral of wash sale
losses and tax treatment of market discount on certain debt instruments.

   The Fund intends to retain realized capital gains that may be offset against
available capital loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. As of
December 31, 2003, the Fund had capital loss carryforwards of $478, expiring in
2011.

   At December 31, 2003, the cost of investments for federal income tax
purposes was $621,022.

3. Financial Instruments:

Options Transactions

   A call option gives the option holder the right to purchase the underlying
security at a specified price until a specified date. A put option gives the
option holder the right to sell the underlying security at a specified price
until a specified date. The risk in writing a covered call option is that the
Fund may forgo the opportunity for profit if the market price of the underlying
security increases and the option is exercised. The risk in writing a put
option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the underlying
security decreases and the option is exercised. In addition, there is a risk
that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an
illiquid secondary market or, for over-the-counter options, because of the
counterparty's inability to perform. Activity in written call and put options
during the period was as follows:

</TABLE>

Swap Agreements

   The use of swaps involves risks that are different from those associated
with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Swap agreements may be
considered to be illiquid. Although the Fund will not enter into any swap
agreement unless the Adviser believes that the other party to the transaction
is creditworthy, the Fund does bear the risk of loss of the amount expected to
be received under the swap agreement in the event of the default or bankruptcy
of the agreement counterparty. The Fund had no open swap agreements at December
31, 2003.

                                      16




Futures

   Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit with
the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a percentage of the
contract amount. This is known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments
("variation margin") are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on
the daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. The daily changes in
contract value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and the Fund
recognizes a gain or loss when the contract is closed.

   The Fund may enter into futures contracts in connection with its interest
rate management strategy or for other purposes. Risks arise from the possible
illiquidity of the futures market and from the possibility that a change in the
value of a contract may not correlate with changes in interest rates, if
applicable. The Fund had no open futures positions at December 31, 2003.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements

   The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Under the terms of a
typical reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells a security subject to an
obligation to repurchase the security from the buyer at an agreed-upon time and
price, thereby determining the yield to the buyer during the buyer's holding
period. A reverse repurchase agreement involves the risk, among others, that
the market value of the collateral retained by the fund may decline below the
price of the securities the fund has sold but is obligated to repurchase under
the agreement. In the event the buyer of securities under a repurchase
agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the fund's use of the
proceeds of the agreement may be restricted pending a determination by the
party, or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the fund's obligation to
repurchase the securities. In entering into reverse repurchase agreements, the
fund will maintain cash, U.S. government securities or other liquid high grade
debt obligations at least equal in value to its obligations with respect to
reverse repurchase agreements or take other actions permitted by law to cover
its obligations.

   At the time the Fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will
segregate, on its books, cash, U.S. government securities or other liquid high
grade debt obligations having a value at least equal to the repurchase price or
take other actions permitted by law to cover its obligations. For the period
ended December 31, 2003, the average amount of reverse repurchase agreements
outstanding was $148,153 and the daily weighted average interest rate was 1.03%.

   As of December 31, 2003, the Fund entered into a reverse repurchase
agreement (the "Reverse Repurchase Agreement") with Lehman Brothers, Inc.
("Lehman") for $25,000, which was settled on January 6, 2004. The Reverse
Repurchase Agreement was recorded at cost and was fully collateralized by a
U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Security with a market value of $30,019, and
a carrying value of $30,000 that matures on January 15, 2011. The implied
interest rate on the Reverse Repurchase Agreement was 0.98%. The Fund
immediately and subsequently invested the proceeds in a repurchase agreement
(the "Repurchase Agreement") with Lehman for $25,000, which agreement was
settled on January 6, 2004. The Repurchase Agreement was recorded at cost and
was fully collateralized by a U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Security with a
fair value of $30,327, and a carrying value of $30,313 that matures on January
15, 2011. The implied interest rate on the Repurchase Agreement was 1.03%.

   As of December 31, 2003, the Fund entered into another reverse repurchase
agreement (the "Reverse Repurchase Agreement") with Lehman for $50,000, which
was settled on January 6, 2004. The Reverse Repurchase Agreement was recorded

   Of the 28,939 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2003,
Western Asset Management Company owned 7 shares.

5. Preferred Shares (amounts are not in thousands):

   There are 8,200 shares of Auction Market Preferred Shares ("Preferred
Shares") authorized. The Preferred Shares have rights as set forth in the
Fund's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended to date, and its Bylaws,
as amended to date (the "Bylaws"), or as otherwise determined by the Trustees.
The 8,200 Preferred Shares outstanding consist of five series: 1,640 shares
each of Series M, Series T, Series W, Series TH, and Series F. The Preferred
Shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per share, plus any accumulated but
unpaid dividends whether or not earned or declared.

   Dividends on all series of Preferred Shares are cumulative and are paid at a
rate typically reset every seven days, based on the results of an auction.
Dividend rates were 1.30% for the initial period beginning on December 19,
2003. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund may not declare
dividends or make other distributions on common shares or purchase any such
shares if, at the time of declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage
with respect to the outstanding Preferred Shares would be less than 200%.

   The Preferred Shares are redeemable at the option of the Fund, in whole or
in part, on any dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
but unpaid dividends. The Preferred Shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends,
whether or not earned or declared, if certain requirements relating to the
composition of the assets and liabilities of the Fund as set forth in the
Bylaws are not satisfied.

   Preferred shareholders, who are entitled to one vote per Preferred Share,
generally vote as a single class with the common shareholders, but will vote
separately as a class (and, in certain circumstances, vote separately by
series) with respect to certain matters set forth in the Bylaws. The preferred
shareholders are entitled to elect two Trustees of the Fund.

6. Securities Loaned:

   The Fund may lend its portfolio securities in order to earn income. The Fund
will receive collateral in cash or high quality securities at least equal to
the current value of the loaned securities. The Fund earns interest on the
securities it lends and income when it invests the collateral for the loaned
securities. As of December 31, 2003, there were no securities on loan.

7. Transactions With Affiliates and Certain Other Parties:

   The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Western
Asset Management Company ("Investment Adviser"), which provides for payment of
a monthly fee computed at the annual rate of 0.40% of the Fund's average weekly
assets. "Average weekly assets" means the average weekly value of the total
assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage) minus
accrued liabilities (other than liabilities representing leverage). For
purposes of calculating "average weekly assets," neither the liquidation
preference of any preferred shares outstanding nor any liabilities associated
with any instrument or transactions used by the Investment Adviser to leverage
the Fund's portfolio (whether or not such instruments or transactions are
"covered" as described in the prospectus) is considered a liability.

                                      18




   Claymore Securities, Inc. ("Servicing Agent") will act as servicing agent
for the Fund. For its services the Servicing Agent will receive an annual fee
from the Fund, payable monthly in arrears, which will be based on the Fund's
average weekly assets in a maximum amount equal to 0.15% of the Fund's average
weekly assets.

   Under the administrative agreement with the Fund, Legg Mason Fund Adviser,
Inc. ("Administrator"), an affiliate of Western Asset, provides certain
administrative and accounting functions for the Fund. In consideration for
these services, the Fund will pay the Administrator a fee, paid monthly, at an
annual rate of $100.

8. Trustee Compensation (dollar amounts are not in thousands):

   Each Trustee currently receives a fee of $8,000 annually for serving as a
Trustee of the Fund and a fee of $1,000 and related expenses for each meeting
of the Board of Trustees attended. The Chairman of the Board receives an
additional $1,500 per year for serving in that capacity. Audit Committee
members receive $500 for each meeting, and the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an additional $1,500 annually. Other committee members receive $500
per meeting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Trustees of Western Asset/Claymore U.S. Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities Fund:

 In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the portfolio of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in net assets, of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Western Asset/Claymore U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Fund
(hereafter referred to as the "Fund") at December 31, 2003, and the results of
its operations, the changes in its net assets and its cash flows, and the
financial highlights for the period presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Procedure: Proxy Voting

Departments Impacted:  Investment  Management,  Compliance,  Investment Support,
Client Services

References:  Western Asset Compliance  Manual Section R Proxy Voting Investment
Advisers  Act Rule  206(4)-6  and Rule  204-2  ERISA DOL  Bulletin  94-2  C.F.R.
2509.94-2

Effective: August 1, 2003


                                   Background

Western Asset Management  Company  ("Western Asset") has adopted and implemented
policies and procedures  that we believe are reasonably  designed to ensure that
proxies  are voted in the best  interest  of  clients,  in  accordance  with our
fiduciary duties and SEC Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
("Advisers  Act").  Our  authority  to  vote  the  proxies  of  our  clients  is
established through investment  management  agreements or comparable  documents,
and our proxy voting  guidelines  have been tailored to reflect  these  specific
contractual obligations. In addition to SEC requirements governing advisers, our
proxy  voting  policies  reflect  the  long-standing   fiduciary  standards  and
responsibilities  for ERISA accounts.  Unless a manager of ERISA assets has been
expressly precluded from voting proxies,  the Department of Labor has determined
that the responsibility for these votes lies with the Investment Manager.

In exercising its voting authority, Western Asset will not consult or enter into
agreements  with  officers,  directors or employees of Legg Mason Inc. or any of
its affiliates (other than Western Asset Management  Company Limited)  regarding
the voting of any securities owned by its clients.

                                     Policy

Western  Asset's proxy voting  procedures are designed and  implemented in a way
that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxy matters are handled in the best
interest of our clients.  While the  guidelines  included in the  procedures are
intended to provide a benchmark  for voting  standards,  each vote is ultimately
cast  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  consideration  Western  Asset's
contractual  obligations  to our  clients  and  all  other  relevant  facts  and
circumstances  at the  time of the  vote  (such  that  these  guidelines  may be
overridden to the extent Western Asset deems appropriate).



                                   Procedures

Responsibility and Oversight

The Western Asset Compliance Department ("Compliance Department") is responsible
for  administering  and  overseeing the proxy voting  process.  The gathering of
proxies is coordinated  through the Corporate Actions area of Investment Support
("Corporate Actions").  Research analysts and portfolio managers are responsible
for  determining  appropriate  voting  positions  on each  proxy  utilizing  any
applicable guidelines contained in these procedures.

Client Authority

Prior to August 1, 2003, all existing client  investment  management  agreements
(IMAs)  will be reviewed to determine  whether  Western Asset has authority to
vote client  proxies.  At account  start-up,  or upon  amendment  of an IMA, the
applicable client IMA are similarly reviewed. If an agreement is silent on proxy
voting, but contains an overall delegation of discretionary  authority or if the
account   represents  assets  of  an  ERISA  plan,  Western  Asset  will  assume
responsibility  for proxy voting. The Client Account Transition Team maintains a
matrix of proxy voting authority.

Proxy Gathering

Registered  owners of  record,  client  custodians,  client  banks and  trustees
(Proxy  Recipients)  that receive proxy  materials on behalf of clients should
forward them to Corporate Actions.  Prior to August 1, 2003, Proxy Recipients of
existing  clients  will be  reminded  of the  appropriate  routing to  Corporate
Actions for proxy  materials  received and reminded of their  responsibility  to
forward all proxy materials on a timely basis.  Proxy Recipients for new clients
(or, if Western Asset becomes aware that the applicable  Proxy  Recipient for an
existing client has changed,  the Proxy  Recipient for the existing  client) are
notified  at  start-up  of  appropriate  routing to  Corporate  Actions of proxy
materials  received  and reminded of their  responsibility  to forward all proxy
materials on a timely basis.  If Western Asset  personnel  other than  Corporate
Actions receive proxy  materials,  they should promptly forward the materials to
Corporate Actions.

Proxy Voting

Once proxy  materials are received by Corporate  Actions,  they are forwarded to
the Compliance Department for coordination and the following actions:

a. Proxies are reviewed to determine accounts impacted.

b. Impacted accounts are checked to confirm Western Asset voting authority.

c.  Compliance  Department  staff reviews proxy issues to determine any material
conflicts of interest.  (See conflicts of interest  section of these  procedures
for further information on determining material conflicts of interest.)

d. If a material  conflict  of  interest  exists,  (i) to the extent  reasonably
practicable  and permitted by applicable  law, the client is promptly  notified,
the conflict is disclosed and Western  Asset  obtains the client's  proxy voting
instructions,  and (ii) to the extent that it is not  reasonably  practicable or
permitted by  applicable  law to notify the client and obtain such  instructions
(e.g.,  the client is a mutual fund or other  commingled  vehicle or is an ERISA
plan client),  Western Asset seeks voting instructions from an independent third
party.

e.  Compliance  Department  staff  provides  proxy  material to the  appropriate
research analyst or portfolio manager to obtain their recommended vote. Research
analysts and portfolio  managers  determine votes on a case-by-case basis taking
into account the voting guidelines contained in these procedures.  For avoidance
of doubt,  depending on the best  interest of each  individual  client,  Western
Asset may vote the same proxy differently for different  clients.  The analyst's
or portfolio  manager's basis for their decision is documented and maintained by
the Compliance Department.

f.  Compliance  Department  staff votes the proxy  pursuant to the  instructions
received in (d) or (e) and returns  the voted  proxy as  indicated  in the proxy
materials.

Timing

Western  Asset  personnel  act in such a manner to ensure that,  absent  special
circumstances,  the proxy  gathering  and proxy  voting steps noted above can be
completed before the applicable deadline for returning proxy votes.

Recordkeeping

Western Asset  maintains  records of proxies voted  pursuant to Section 204-2 of
the Advisers Act and ERISA DOL Bulletin 94-2. These records include:

a. A copy of Western Asset's policies and procedures.

b. Copies of proxy statements received regarding client securities.

c. A copy of any document created by Western Asset that was material to making a
decision how to vote proxies.

d. Each  written  client  request for proxy voting  records and Western  Asset's
written response to both verbal and written client requests.

e. A proxy log  including:  1. Issuer name;  2.  Exchange  ticker  symbol of the
issuer's  shares to be voted;  3. Council on Uniform  Securities  Identification
Procedures   ("CUSIP")   number  for  the  shares  to  be  voted;   4.  A  brief
identification of the matter voted on; 5. Whether the matter was proposed by the
issuer or by a  shareholder  of the  issuer;  6.  Whether a vote was cast on the
matter;  7. A record of how the vote was cast;  and 8. Whether the vote was cast
for or against the recommendation of the issuer's management team.

Records are maintained in an easily  accessible  place for five years, the first
two in Western Asset's offices.

Disclosure

Western  Asset's proxy policies are described in the firm's Part II of Form ADV.
Prior to August 1, 2003,  Western Asset will deliver Part II of its revised Form
ADV to all existing clients, along with a letter identifying the new disclosure.
Clients will be provided a copy of these policies and  procedures  upon request.
In addition, upon request, clients may receive reports on how their proxies have
been voted.

Conflicts of Interest

All proxies are reviewed by the Compliance  Department for material conflicts of
interest. Issues to be reviewed include, but are not limited to:

1. Whether  Western (or, to the extent  required to be  considered by applicable
law, its affiliates)  manages assets for the company or an employee group of the
company or otherwise has an interest in the company;

2.  Whether  Western  or an  officer or  director  of Western or the  applicable
portfolio  manager  or  analyst  responsible  for  recommending  the proxy  vote
(together,  "Voting  Persons")  is a  close  relative  of or has a  personal  or
business  relationship with an executive,  director or person who is a candidate
for director of the company or is a participant in a proxy contest; and

3. Whether there is any other business or personal  relationship  where a Voting
Person has a personal interest in the outcome of the matter before shareholders.

                                   Voting Guidelines

Western Asset's  substantive  voting  decisions turn on the particular facts and
circumstances  of each proxy vote and are evaluated by the  designated  research
analyst  or  portfolio  manager.  The  examples  outlined  below  are  meant  as
guidelines to aid in the decision making process.

Guidelines are grouped according to the types of proposals  generally  presented
to  shareholders.  Part I deals with proposals  which have been approved and are
recommended  by a company's  board of  directors;  Part II deals with  proposals
submitted by shareholders for inclusion in proxy statements;  Part III addresses
issues relating to voting shares of investment companies;  and Part IV addresses
unique considerations pertaining to foreign issuers.

I. Board Approved Proposals

The vast  majority  of matters  presented  to  shareholders  for a vote  involve
proposals  made by a company  itself that have been approved and  recommended by
its board of directors.  In view of the enhanced corporate  governance practices
currently being implemented in public  companies,  Western Asset generally votes
in support  of  decisions  reached  by  independent  boards of  directors.  More
specific guidelines related to certain board-approved proposals are as follows:

1. Matters relating to the Board of Directors

Western  Asset votes  proxies for the  election of the  company's  nominees  for
directors  and for  board-approved  proposals on other  matters  relating to the
board of directors with the following exceptions:

a. Votes are  withheld  for the entire  board of directors if the board does not
have a majority of independent  directors or the board does not have nominating,
audit and compensation committees composed solely of independent directors.

b.  Votes are  withheld  for any  nominee  for  director  who is  considered  an
independent  director by the company and who has received  compensation from the
company other than for service as a director.

c. Votes are  withheld for any nominee for director who attends less than 75% of
board and committee meetings without valid reasons for absences.

d. Votes are cast on a case-by-case basis in contested elections of directors.


2. Matters relating to Executive Compensation

Western Asset  generally  favors  compensation  programs  that relate  executive
compensation  to  a  company's  long-term  performance.  Votes  are  cast  on  a
case-by-case   basis  on   board-approved   proposals   relating  to   executive
compensation, except as follows:

a. Except where the firm is otherwise  withholding votes for the entire board of
directors,  Western  Asset  votes for stock  option  plans that will result in a
minimal annual dilution.  . b. Western Asset votes against stock option plans or
proposals that permit replacing or repricing of underwater options.

c.  Western  Asset votes  against  stock  option  plans that permit  issuance of
options with an exercise price below the stock's current market price.

d. Except where the firm is otherwise  withholding votes for the entire board of
directors,  Western Asset votes for employee stock purchase plans that limit the
discount for shares purchased under the plan to no more than 15% of their market
value,  have an  offering  period of 27 months or less and result in dilution of
10% or less.

3. Matters relating to Capitalization

The management of a company's capital  structure  involves a number of important
issues,  including cash flows,  financing  needs and market  conditions that are
unique to the circumstances of each company. As a result, Western Asset votes on
a  case-by-case  basis  on  board-approved  proposals  involving  changes  to  a
company's  capitalization  except where Western  Asset is otherwise  withholding
votes for the entire board of directors.

a. Western Asset votes for proposals relating to the authorization of additional
common stock.

b. Western Asset votes for proposals to effect stock splits  (excluding  reverse
stock splits).

c. Western Asset votes for proposals authorizing share repurchase programs.

4.  Matters  relating  to  Acquisitions,   Mergers,  Reorganizations  and  Other
Transactions

Western  Asset  votes these  issues on a  case-by-case  basis on  board-approved
transactions.

5. Matters relating to Anti-Takeover Measures

Western  Asset votes  against  board-approved  proposals to adopt  anti-takeover
measures except as follows:

a. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or approve
shareholder rights plans.

b. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals to adopt fair price
provisions.

6. Other Business Matters

Western Asset votes for board-approved proposals approving such routine business
matters  such as changing the  company's  name,  ratifying  the  appointment  of
auditors and procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting.

a. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend a company's
charter or bylaws.

b. Western Asset votes against  authorization  to transact  other  unidentified,
substantive business at the meeting.

II. Shareholder Proposals

SEC  regulations  permit  shareholders  to submit  proposals  for inclusion in a
company's proxy statement.  These proposals generally seek to change some aspect
of a company's  corporate  governance  structure or to change some aspect of its
business  operations.  Western Asset votes in accordance with the recommendation
of the  company's  board of directors on all  shareholder  proposals,  except as
follows:

1. Western Asset votes for shareholder proposals to require shareholder approval
of shareholder rights plans.

2.  Western  Asset votes for  shareholder  proposals  that are  consistent  with
Western Asset's proxy voting guidelines for board-approved proposals.

3. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on other  shareholder  proposals
where the firm is otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of directors.

III. Voting Shares of Investment Companies

Western Asset may utilize shares of open or closed-end  investment  companies to
implement its investment strategies.  Shareholder votes for investment companies
that  fall  within  the  categories  listed in Parts I and II above are voted in
accordance with those guidelines.

1. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals relating to changes
in the  investment  objectives of an investment  company taking into account the
original  intent  of the  fund and the  role  the  fund  plays  in the  clients'
portfolios.

2. Western Asset votes on a  case-by-case  basis all proposals that would result
in increases in expenses (e.g., proposals to adopt 12b-1 plans, alter investment
advisory  arrangements or approve fund mergers)  taking into account  comparable
expenses for similar funds and the services to be provided.

IV. Voting Shares of Foreign Issuers

In the event  Western  Asset is required to vote on  securities  held in foreign
issuers  - i.e.  issuers  that are  incorporated  under  the  laws of a  foreign
jurisdiction and that are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange or the NASDAQ
stock  market,  the  following  guidelines  are used,  which are premised on the
existence  of a sound  corporate  governance  and  disclosure  framework.  These
guidelines, however, may not be appropriate under some circumstances for foreign
issuers and therefore apply only where applicable.

1. Western Asset votes for shareholder  proposals  calling for a majority of the
directors to be independent of management.

2.  Western  Asset  votes for  shareholder  proposals  seeking to  increase  the
independence of board nominating, audit and compensation committees.

3.  Western  Asset votes for  shareholder  proposals  that  implement  corporate
governance standards similar to those established under U.S. federal law and the
listing requirements of U.S. stock exchanges,  and that do not otherwise violate
the laws of the jurisdiction under which the company is incorporated.

4. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case  basis on proposals relating to (1) the
issuance  of common  stock in excess of 20% of a  company's  outstanding  common
stock where  shareholders do not have preemptive  rights, or (2) the issuance of
common  stock in excess of 100% of a company's  outstanding  common  stock where
shareholders have preemptive rights.

CODE OF ETHICS CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 FOR
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

October 29, 2003

I.       Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

This  Code  of  Ethics  (this  "Code")   contemplated  by  Section  406  of  the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 has been  adopted  by  Western  Asset/Claymore  U.S.
Treasury  Inflation  Protected  Securities  Fund (the "Fund") and applies to the
Fund's Principal  Executive Officer,  Principal  Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting  Officer  (the  "Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is  identified  in
Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

honest and  ethical  conduct,  including  the  ethical  handling  of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;

full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure in reports and
documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the  Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Fund;

compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

the prompt  internal  reporting of  violations  of the Code to an  appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high  standard of business  ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of interest.

II. Covered  Officers Should Handle  Ethically  Actual or Apparent  Conflicts of
Interest

Overview.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private
interest  interferes  with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund.
For  example,  a conflict of interest  would  arise if a Covered  Officer,  or a
member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between  Covered
Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions
in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations thereunder, the
"1940 Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  (including the regulations
thereunder,  the "Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered Officers may
not engage in certain  transactions  (such as the  purchase or sale of portfolio
securities  or other  property)  with  the  Fund  because  of  their  status  as
"affiliated  persons" of the Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of the
Fund and its investment  adviser (the "Adviser") and other service providers are
designed  to prevent,  or  identify  and  correct,  violations  of many of those
provisions,  although they are not designed to provide absolute  assurance as to
those  matters.  This Code does not, and is not  intended to,  repeat or replace
these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters
of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit,
conflicts  may arise  from,  or as a result  of,  the  contractual  relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser,  or the Fund and any other service provider to
the  Fund  of  which  the  Covered  Officers  are  also  officers  or  employees
(including,  without  limitation,  Legg Mason Fund  Adviser,  Inc.  and Claymore
Securities,  Inc.). As a result,  this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers
will,  in the  normal  course of their  duties  (whether  for the Fund,  for the
Adviser,  for such  other  service  provider  or any  combination  thereof),  be
involved in  establishing  policies and  implementing  decisions  that will have
different  effects on the  Adviser or such other  service  provider,  on the one
hand, and the Fund, on the other hand. The participation of the Covered Officers
in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationships between the Fund
and its service  providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
Officers  of their  duties  as  officers  of the Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in
conformity  with the  provisions of the 1940 Act, the  Investment  Advisers Act,
other applicable law and the Fund's  constitutional  documents,  such activities
will be deemed to have been  handled  ethically  for  purposes of this Code.  In
addition,  it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Trustees  ("Board")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment  companies  covered by this or other codes and that such service,  by
itself, does not give rise to a conflict of interest.

Other  conflicts of interest are covered by the Code,  even if such conflicts of
interest are not the subject of  provisions  of the 1940 Act and the  Investment
Advisers  Act. The  following  list  provides  examples of conflicts of interest
under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are
not  exhaustive.  The overarching  principle is that the personal  interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Fund,
unless  the  personal  interest  has been  disclosed  to and  approved  by other
officers of the Fund or the Fund's Board or a committee of the Fund's Board that
has no such personal interest.

* * * *

Each Covered Officer must not:

use his or her personal  influence  or personal  relationships  improperly  to
influence  investment  decisions or financial  reporting by the Fund whereby the
Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

cause the Fund to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the  individual
personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; or

retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the Fund or its
service  providers  for reports of  potential  violations  that are made in good
faith.

There are some conflict of interest situations that, if material,  should always
be approved by the Chief Legal Officer of the Fund.  These  conflict of interest
situations are listed below:

service on the board of  directors  or  governing  board of a publicly  traded
entity;

the receipt of any non-nominal  gifts from persons or entities who have or are
seeking business relationships with the Fund;

the  receipt of any  entertainment  from any  company  with which the Fund has
current  or  prospective   business   dealings  unless  such   entertainment  is
business-related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment  relationship with,
any  entities  doing  business  with the Fund  (other  than the  Adviser  or its
affiliates or, to the extent that such interest or  relationship is disclosed to
the Board before such officer is elected, any other Fund service provider or its
affiliates).  This  restriction  shall  not  apply  to or  otherwise  limit  the
ownership  of  publicly  traded  securities  so  long  as the  Covered  Person's
ownership  does not  exceed 2% of the  outstanding  securities  of the  relevant
class.

a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or
spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio  transactions or for selling or
redeeming  shares  other than an interest  arising  from the  Covered  Officer's
employment  with the  Adviser or its  affiliates  (or,  to the extent  that such
employment  is disclosed  to the Board before such officer is elected,  with any
other Fund service provider or its affiliates). This restriction shall not apply
to or otherwise limit the ownership of publicly traded securities so long as the
Covered Person's  ownership does not exceed 2% of the outstanding  securities of
the relevant class.

III.     Disclosure and Compliance

each Covered  Officer  should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to
misrepresent,  facts  about the Fund to others,  whether  within or outside  the
Fund, including to the Fund's Board and auditors, and to governmental regulators
and self-regulatory organizations;

each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate within his or her area
of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the
Adviser and, as applicable,  other Fund service providers or with counsel to the
Fund with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable
disclosure  in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or submits to, the
SEC and in other  public  communications  made by the Fund  (which,  for sake of
clarity,  does not  include  any sales  literature,  omitting  prospectuses,  or
"tombstone" advertising prepared by the Fund's principal underwriter(s)); and

it is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote  compliance with
the  standards  and   restrictions   imposed  by  applicable   laws,  rules  and
regulations.

IV.      Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

upon  adoption  of the Code (or  thereafter  as  applicable,  upon  becoming a
Covered  Officer),  affirm in writing  to the Fund that he or she has  received,
read and understands the Code;

provide full and fair responses to all questions  asked in the Fund's periodic
Trustee and Officer  Questionnaire  as well as with respect to any  supplemental
request for information; and

notify the Chief Legal  Officer of the Fund promptly if he or she knows of any
material violation of this Code.

The Chief Legal  Officer of the Fund is  responsible  for applying  this Code to
specific  situations  in  which  questions  are  presented  under it and has the
authority to  interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any
approvals  or  waivers  sought by the Chief  Legal  Officer,  other  than  those
expressly  contemplated  herein,  will be considered by the audit committee (the
"Committee").

The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code:

the Chief Legal Officer will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
potential material violations reported to him, which actions may include the use
of internal or external counsel, accountants or other personnel;

if,  after  such  investigation,  the Chief  Legal  Officer  believes  that no
material violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not required to take
any further action;



any matter that the Chief Legal Officer believes is a material violation will be
reported to the Committee;

if the  Committee  concurs that a material  violation  has  occurred,  it will
inform and make a recommendation to the Board,  which will consider  appropriate
action,  which  may  include  review  of,  and  appropriate   modifications  to,
applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the
Adviser or other  applicable  service provider or its board; or a recommendation
to dismiss the Covered Officer;

the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems appropriate;

any  changes  to or waivers of this Code  will,  to the  extent  required,  be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       Other Policies and Procedures

This Code shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the Fund for  purposes of
Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the rules and forms  applicable  to
registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar  as  other  policies  or
procedures of the Fund or the Adviser or other Fund service  providers govern or
purport to govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are
subject to this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict  with the  provisions  of this Code.  The Fund's and its  Adviser's and
service  providers'  codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Adviser's and other service  providers'  more detailed  compliance  policies and
procedures  are  separate  requirements  applying  to the Covered  Officers  and
others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      Amendments

Any  amendments  to this  Code,  other  than  amendments  to  Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII.     Confidentiality

All  reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code will be
considered  confidential  and shall be  maintained  and  protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than to the Board of Trustees of the Fund or the board
or  counsel  for any other  registered  investment  company  for which a Covered
Person serves in a similar capacity or as otherwise authorized by the Board.

VIII.    Internal Use

The  Code is  intended  solely  for the  internal  use by the  Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance or legal conclusion.
