            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Directors of
     O'Connor Fund of Funds: Multi Strategy

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of O'Connor
Fund of Funds: Multi Strategy (the "Fund") as of March 31, 2011, and the related
statements of operations, changes in net assets, cash flows and financial
highlights for the period from March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) to
March 31, 2011. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
O'Connor Fund of Funds: Multi Strategy as of March 31, 2011, the results of its
operations and its cash flows, the changes in its net assets, and the financial
highlights for the period from March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) to
March 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                                                  MARCH 31, 2011

1.   ORGANIZATION

     O'Connor Fund of Funds: Multi-Strategy (the "Fund") was formed on February
     7, 2011 as a statutory trust registered under the Investment Company Act of
     1940, as amended, as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment
     company and commenced operations on March 29, 2011. The Fund's investment
     objective is to seek to consistently realize risk-adjusted appreciation.
     The Fund is a multi-manager fund that seeks to achieve its objective by
     deploying its assets among a select group of alternative asset managers
     (the "Investment Managers") and the funds they operate. The Investment
     Managers with whom the Fund expects to invest generally conduct their
     investment programs through unregistered investment vehicles (collectively,
     the "Investment Funds"), in which the Fund invests as a limited partner,
     member or shareholder along with other investors. For the period ended
     March 31, 2011, the Fund did not hold any investments in Investment Funds.

     The Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board") has overall responsibility to
     manage and control the business affairs of the Fund, including the
     exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the
     management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.

     The Board has engaged UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC
     ("UBS A&Q" or the "Adviser"), a Delaware limited liability company, to
     provide investment advice regarding the selection of Investment Funds and
     to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. UBS A&Q is a
     wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered as an investment
     adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     The Fund is offering up to $500,000,000 of shares of beneficial interest
     (the "Shares") at an initial price of $1,000 per Share, for an authorized
     total of up to 500,000 shares. The Shares are being distributed by UBS
     Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial"), the Fund's principal
     underwriter, and other brokers or dealers. UBS Financial or its affiliates
     may pay from their own resources compensation to their financial advisers
     and brokers or dealers in connection with the sale and distribution of the
     Shares or servicing of shareholders. Generally, the stated minimum
     investment is Shares with a value of at least $50,000, which minimum may be
     reduced in the Adviser's sole discretion, but not below $25,000.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase Shares pursuant to
     written tenders by shareholders. These repurchases will be made at such
     times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its complete
     and exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the
     Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares from shareholders in
     September 2011 and quarterly thereafter.

                                                                  MARCH 31, 2011

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund will value its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which is the price that
     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various inputs will be used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within one year of
     the measurement date

     LEVEL 3-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds that do not have
     the ability to redeem at net asset value within one year of the measurement
     date

     The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at
     the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers into and out of
     the levels indicated above at March 31, 2011.

     GAAP provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or
     similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides guidance on identifying
     circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider
     inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and
     liabilities. Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of
     assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value measurements
     are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets
     and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than the Fund's line items
     in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. The Fund
     determines the appropriate classes for those disclosures on the basis of
     the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their classification
     in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Levels 1, 2, and 3).

     For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
     during the period, the Fund provides quantitative disclosures about the
     fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and
     liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances
     of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class. At March 31, 2011,
     the Fund did not hold any Level 1, 2 or 3 investment assets or liabilities.

     Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
     Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
     determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board.

                                                                  MARCH 31, 2011

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.     PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     investments in Investment Funds will be subject to the terms and conditions
     of the respective operating agreements and offering memorandums, as
     appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds will be carried at
     fair value. All valuations will utilize financial information supplied by
     each Investment Fund and will be net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements. The Fund's valuation
     procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information
     available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser will
     assess factors including, but not limited to, the individual Investment
     Funds' compliance with fair value measurements, price transparency and
     valuation procedures in place, and subscription and redemption activity.
     The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information and consider
     whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value
     such a position at its net asset value as reported or whether to adjust
     such value. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund will be
     accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's
     financial statements.

     The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of any Investment
     Funds, for which there is no ready market, may be estimated by the
     respective Investment Funds' management and may be based upon available
     information in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values and may not
     necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to the
     inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated fair values may differ
     significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market
     for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

     B.     INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund will account for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
     transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C.     FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
     limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting
     and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; offering costs; due
     diligence, including travel and related expenses; expenses of meetings of
     the Board; all costs with respect to communications to shareholders; and
     other types of expenses approved by the Trustees. Expenses are recorded on
     the accrual basis.

                                                                  MARCH 31, 2011

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     C.     FUND EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     Costs incurred in connection with the Fund's organization, estimated to
     total $114,316, will be paid by the Adviser and are not subject to
     reimbursement by the Fund. Offering costs, estimated to aggregate
     approximately $395,667, were recorded as a deferred charge until operations
     began and thereafter are amortized to expense over twelve months on a
     straight line basis as the Fund intends to have a continuous offering. If
     the offering period terminates earlier than expected, the remaining
     deferred balance will be charged to expense. As such, for the period from
     March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2011, $3,243
     was expensed and included as offerings costs in the Statement of
     Operations.

     D. INCOME TAXES

     The Fund intends to elect and to qualify, and intends to continue to
     qualify each year, to be treated as a regulated investment company under
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     The Fund will file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
     applicable states. Management will analyze the Fund's tax positions, and
     will determine if a tax provision for federal or state income tax is
     required in the Fund's financial statements. The Fund's federal and state
     income tax returns for the current tax year will be subject to examination
     by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. The Fund
     will recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
     benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. For the
     period from March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) through March 31,
     2011, the Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

     E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies invested in a PFPC Trust
     Company account which pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost
     plus accrued interest, if any. Such cash, at times, may exceed federally
     insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts
     and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such
     accounts.

     F. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make
     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
     of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
     decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
     results could differ from those estimates.

                                                                  MARCH 31, 2011


3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Adviser also provides certain
     administrative services to the Fund, including: providing office space,
     handling of shareholder inquiries regarding the Fund, providing
     shareholders with information concerning their investment in the Fund,
     coordinating and organizing meetings of the Fund's Board and providing
     other support services. In consideration for all such services, the Fund
     will pay the Adviser a fee (the "Advisory Fee"), computed and payable
     monthly, at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Fund's adjusted net assets
     determined as of the last day of each month. Adjusted net assets as of any
     month-end date means the total value of all assets of the Fund, less an
     amount equal to all accrued debts, liabilities and obligations of the Fund
     other than Incentive Fee accruals (as described below), if any, as of such
     date, and calculated before giving effect to any repurchase of Shares on
     such date.

     The Advisory Fee is computed as of the start of business on the last
     business day of the period to which each Advisory Fee relates, after
     adjustment for any Share purchases effective on such date, and will be
     payable in arrears. There was no Advisory Fee accrued for the period from
     March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2011.

     In addition to the Advisory Fee paid to the Adviser, the Adviser is paid an
     incentive fee (the "Incentive Fee") on a quarterly basis in an amount equal
     to 5% of the Fund's net profits. For the purposes of calculating the
     Incentive Fee for any fiscal quarter, net profits will be determined by
     taking into account net realized gain or loss (including realized gain that
     has been distributed to shareholders during a fiscal quarter and net of
     Fund expenses, including the Advisory Fee) and the net change in unrealized
     appreciation or depreciation of securities positions, as well as dividends,
     interest and other income. No Incentive Fee will be payable for any period
     unless losses and depreciation from prior periods have been recovered by
     the Fund, known as a "high water mark" calculation. The Adviser is under no
     obligation to repay any Incentive Fees previously paid by the Fund. Thus,
     the payment of the Incentive Fee for a period will not be reversed by the
     subsequent decline of the Fund's assets in any subsequent fiscal period.
     There was no Incentive Fee accrued for the period from March 29, 2011
     (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2011.

     The Incentive Fee is in addition to the incentive fees payable in respect
     of the Investment Funds (generally approximating 20% of net profits)
     charged by the Investment Managers.

     The Adviser has voluntarily entered into an expense limitation agreement
     (the "Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement") with the Fund for a
     three-year term beginning on March 1, 2011 and ending on February 28, 2014
     (the "Limitation Period") to limit the amount of Specified Expenses (as
     described below) to be borne by the Fund during the Limitation Period to an
     amount not to exceed 1.5% per annum of the Fund's net assets (the "Expense
     Cap") (computed and applied on a monthly basis). "Specified Expenses" is
     defined to include all expenses incurred in the business

     of the Fund, provided that the following expenses are excluded from the
     definition of Specified Expenses: (i) the Advisory Fee, (ii) the Incentive
     Fee, (iii) fees of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests, (iv)
     interest payments and (v) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole
     discretion of the Adviser). To the extent that Specified Expenses for any
     month exceed the Expense Cap, the Adviser will reimburse the Fund for
     expenses to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The Adviser may
     discontinue its obligations under the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement
     Agreement at any time in its sole discretion after the first twelve months
     of the Limitation Period upon appropriate notice to the Fund. To the extent
     that the Adviser bears Specified Expenses, it is permitted to receive
     reimbursement for any expense amounts previously paid or borne by the
     Adviser, for a period not to exceed three years from the date on which such
     expenses were paid or borne by the Adviser, even if such reimbursement
     occurs after the termination of the Limitation Period, provided that the
     Specified Expenses have fallen to a level below the Expense Cap and the
     reimbursement amount does not raise the level of Specified Expenses in the
     month the reimbursement is being made to a level that exceeds the Expense
     Cap. For the period from March 29, 2011 (commencement of operations) to
     March 31, 2011, the Fund has recorded an expense reimbursement by Adviser
     of $31,619, of which the full amount is subject to recapture by the Adviser
     through February 28, 2014, the end of the Expense Limitation and
     Reimbursement Agreement period.

4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian"), which will be renamed BNY Mellon
     Investment Servicing Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, provides
     custodial services for the Fund. The Custodian entered into a service
     agreement whereby PFPC Trust provides securities clearance functions, as
     needed.

     BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY Mellon") serves as
     accounting and investor servicing agent to the Fund and in that capacity
     provides certain administrative, accounting, record keeping, tax and
     shareholder related services. BNY Mellon receives a monthly fee primarily
     based upon the average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum monthly
     fee. Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses
     incurred by BNY Mellon. The administration fee is effective beginning on
     April 1, 2011.

     BNY Mellon agrees to waive certain fees under the administration,
     accounting and investor services agreement as follows: for the first two
     months of operations of the Fund, BNY Mellon will waive 100% of its minimum
     monthly fee (excluding out-of-pocket costs) to the extent these fees are
     applicable. Thereafter, BNY Mellon's minimum monthly fees shall be charged
     as follows: during the third calendar month of operations, the Fund will be
     charged and pay 10% per month of the minimum fee rate; 20% during the
     fourth month; 30% during the fifth month; 40% during the sixth

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                                     UBSAQ
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBSAQ votes proxies for each fund (each a "Fund," collectively, the
"Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as such, has adopted these
Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies and Procedures").   The
Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in unregistered investment
vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other than the Fund.
Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets in non-voting
securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do not submit
matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted for vote
and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund, the Adviser
will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the Fund and in
accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of Directors (the
"Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures as the Funds'.
The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's Policies and
Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process.  The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value.  This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary.  Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest.  In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

   -  A  current  investor  of  the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
      Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
      an  impending  proxy  vote;

   -  The  portfolio  manager  responsible  for proxy-voting has identified a
      personal interest  in  the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
      outcome of a shareholder  vote;

<PAGE>

   -  Members  of  the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
      manager responsible  for  proxy-voting,  and/or  members of senior
      management, have  a  personal  interest  through investment in the
      Investment Fund soliciting  proxies;

   -  Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
      outcome of a  shareholder  vote  have attempted to influence either the
      Adviser or the portfolio  manager  responsible  for  voting  a  proxy.

Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business.  Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the Adviser may
vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.   The Adviser shall
maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified, the
materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material conflict
of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

   -  Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which consent
      in the case  of  the  Fund(s)  may  be  obtained  from the Fund's board of
      directors);

   -  Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on its
      behalf;

   -  Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy based
      on application of the policies set forth herein; or

   -  Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances given
      the nature of the conflict.

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating

<PAGE>

to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon request,
without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice.  In the
event a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these
Policies and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

   -  A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

   -  A record  of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

   -  A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and related
      materials with regard to each vote;

   -  A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
      conflicts of interest;

   -  A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a proxy
      -voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that decision; and

   -  A copy of each written investor request for information on how the
      Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written
      response from the Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for
      information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                    O'CONNOR FUND OF FUNDS:  MULTI-STRATEGY
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team that is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. The members of the portfolio
management team are Bruce Almicke, Americo Nardis and Norman E. Sienko, Jr.
(each, a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers"). The
portfolio management team is responsible for the selection and allocation of the
Fund's investments.

Mr. Amlicke has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception.
He is a Managing Director and the Co-Chief Investment Officer and Head of the
Adviser's Alternative Investment Solutions group. Prior to re-joining UBS in
2010, Mr. Amlicke served as Chief Investment Officer of Blackstone Alternative
Asset Management and Senior Managing Director of The Blackstone Group LP. Prior
to that, Mr. Amlicke was Chief Investment Officer of the O'Connor Multi-Manager
Program, which became the Adviser in March 2004, from 2003 to 2004. Mr. Nardis
has been a Portfolio Manager

<PAGE>

of the Fund since its inception. He is a Managing Director and the Co-Chief
Investment Officer of the Adviser's Alternative Investment Solutions group. From
1998 to 2001, Mr. Nardis worked in the Manager Research Department at Tremont
Advisers, Inc. as a Primary Specialist in Long/Short Equity. Mr. Sienko has
served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since inception. He served as head of
UBS Alternative Investments US' portfolio management group from 1998 to 2010,
prior to joining the Adviser. He is also currently an Executive Director and a
Senior Investment Officer of the Adviser.

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. A potential conflict of interest may
also arise if the Adviser receives a performance-based advisory fee from one
account but not another because a Portfolio Manager may favor the account
subject to the performance fee, whether or not the performance of that account
directly determines the Portfolio Manager's compensation. The Adviser
periodically reviews the Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure
that they are able to allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively
manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel at the
Adviser periodically review the performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by the Adviser or its affiliates and not by the
Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of stock or
stock options of UBS AG, the parent company of the Adviser, subject to certain
vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's discretionary bonus, and
the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of UBS AG, is determined by
senior officers of the Adviser. In general, the amount of the bonus will be
based on a combination of factors, none of which is necessarily weighted more
than any other factor. These factors may include: the overall performance of the

<PAGE>

Adviser; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to the Adviser
derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed by the
Adviser; the absolute performance of the Fund and such other accounts for the
preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio Manager to assisting in managing
the Adviser; participation by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel;
and support by the Portfolio Manager generally to colleagues. The bonus is not
based on a precise formula, benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                         AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

     This code of ethics (the "Code") for the UBSAQ registered funds (each, a
     "Fund") (Exhibit A) applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer and
     Principal Accounting Officer and other persons performing similar
     functions, each of whom is listed on Exhibit B (the "Covered Officers"),
     for the purpose of promoting:

          -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
               actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
               professional relationships;

          -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
               reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to,
               the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other
               public communications made by the Fund;

          -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
               regulations;

          -    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
               appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

          -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
     and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well
     as apparent conflicts of interest.

II. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
     interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund.
     For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
     member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
     his position with the Fund.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out  of  the relationships between
     Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of
     interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
     "1940 Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "
     Advisers Act").  For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage
     in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
     other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated
     persons" of the Fund.  Policies and procedures applicable to the Fund and
     the Fund's investment adviser (collectively, the "Adviser") are designed
     to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions.  The
     Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these

<PAGE>

     programs and procedures, and the circumstances they cover fall outside of
     the parameters of the Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
     benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
     relationship between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered
     Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes
     that the Covered Officers, in the ordinary course of their duties (whether
     formally for the Fund or for the Adviser, or for both), will be involved
     in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
     different effects on the Adviser and the Fund. The participation of the
     Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
     relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is consistent with the
     performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the
     Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the 1940 Act
     and the Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
     conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the 1940 Act and
     the Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that the Code
     cannot cover every possible scenario. The overarching principle of the
     Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be
     placed improperly before the interest of the Fund.

             Each  Covered  Officer  must:

     -    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly
          to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     -    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund;

     -    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
          or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to
          trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
          transactions; and

     -    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith.

III. Disclosure and Compliance

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
          requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     -    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members and
          auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations; and

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
          area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
          the Fund and the Adviser and take other appropriate steps with the
          goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely

<PAGE>

          and  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund
          files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications
          made by the Fund; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
          compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

IV. Reporting and Accountability

            Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon
          becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he
          has received, read, and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he/she has complied with
          the requirements of the Code; and

     -    notify the Chief Compliance Officer or designee, (collectively the
          "CCO") promptly if he/she knows of any violation of the Code. Failure
          to do so is itself a violation of the Code.

     The CCO is responsible for applying the Code to specific situations in
     which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret
     the Code in any particular situation. However, approvals, interpretations
     or waivers sought by any Covered Officer will be considered by a committee
     designated by the Fund's Board (the "Committee"). In the absence of a
     designation, the Committee shall be the Board.

           The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
           the Code:

     -    the CCO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
          violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has
          occurred, the CCO is not required to take any further action;

     -    any matter that the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to
          the Committee;

     -    if the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider
          appropriate action, which may include: review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or a recommendation
          to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     -    the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as
          appropriate; and

     -    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required,
          will be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

<PAGE>

V. Other Policies and Procedures

     The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
     of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and forms
     applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
     policies and procedures of the Fund, the Adviser, principal underwriter,
     or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
     activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are
     superseded by the Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with
     the provisions of the Code. The Fund's, the Adviser's codes of ethics
     under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Adviser's additional policies
     and procedures are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers
     and others, and are not part of the Code.

VI. Amendments

     Except as to Exhibit B, the Code may not be amended except in written
     form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the
     Fund's Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will
     be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
     accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters
     shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and
     their counsel, the appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel
     and the Adviser.

VIII. Internal Use

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
     constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
     circumstance, or legal conclusion.

IX.  CONTROL PROCESS

     INITIAL CONTACT:

     Immediately after the Board officially appoints a Covered Officer, the CCO
     will furnish a copy of this Code to the Covered Officer. The Covered
     Officer will be required to submit his/her certification (Exhibit C) to
     the CCO within 10 days of his/her appointment. The certification will be
     presented to the Board at the next scheduled Board meeting.

     ANNUAL:

     At the beginning of October the CCO will furnish the certification
     (Exhibit C) to the Covered Officers and such signed certifications will be
     presented to the Board at the November Board meeting.

          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
