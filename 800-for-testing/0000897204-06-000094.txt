The Fund

     The investment  objective of the Fund is to outperform  over the long term,
on a total return basis (including appreciation and dividends),  the Tokyo Stock
Price Index ("TOPIX"), a composite  market-capitalization  weighted index of all
common stocks listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange  ("TSE").
The Fund seeks to achieve its  investment  objective by investing  substantially
all of its assets in equity  securities of companies listed on the TSE or listed

Japan.  Daiwa SB  Investments  (U.S.A.) Ltd. is the Fund's  Investment  Manager.
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. is the Fund's Investment Adviser.  The Fund implements
an "active"  portfolio  management  policy,  which is an approach  that involves
quantitative  valuation of  securities  to identify an  appropriate  universe of
securities  from which to select  investments,  with  judgmental  analysis  then
applied to this universe to determine the actual  investments  to be made by the
Fund.

Comment

     o During the period from November  2005 to April 2006,  the net asset value
       of the Fund increased by 18.91% in USD terms.  Over the same period,  the
       TOPIX Index advanced by 20.21%.

     o In JPY terms,  the  performance of the Fund,  excluding  expenses and the
       cash position effect, was 18.73%, whereas the TOPIX Index was up 19.54%.

     o Relative to the TOPIX Index,  the sector selection effect was positive by
       1.0% while the stock  selection  effect was  negative  by 0.93% and other
       factors were negative by 0.88% (see Table 3).

     o As shown in Table 4, overweight positions in nonferrous metals, machinery
       and rubber  products  made a  significant  contribution  to the  positive
       sector selection effect.  Over the period,  however,  there was a sizable
       negative  stock  selection   effect  in  the  retailing,   information  &
       communication, electric appliance and securities brokerage sectors.

     o In Japan, the market trend was quite different during the last two months
       of 2005 and the early part of 2006. Small capitalization stocks performed
       very well at the end of 2005,  but the trend  reversed  in the  middle of
       January  due  to the  "Livedoor  Shock"  described  below  under  "Market
       Review".  Small-cap  indices  slumped after the Livedoor  shock,  and the
       trend  continued  until April.  In the last two months of 2005, the TOPIX
       Index gained  14.19% while the Tokyo Stock  Exchange  ("TSE") 2nd section
       Index was up 20.56% and the JASDAQ Index  returned  23.40%.  In the first
       four months of 2006, the TOPIX Index rose 4.04%.  During the same period,
       the TOPIX 100 Index, containing the 100 largest stocks trading on the TSE
       1st section,  gained 5.68%,  the TSE 2nd section Index lost 3.75% and the
       JASDAQ Index dropped 10.76%.

Market Review (November 2005 - April 2006)

     The  following is a review of the Japanese  equity market over the past six
months:

     Stocks on the TSE  recorded  gains in the six months  ended April 30, 2006.
Following a gain of 28.3% in the six months ended  October 31,  2005,  the TOPIX
Index gained an  additional  19.42% in the six months to April 30, 2006. In U.S.
Dollar terms,  the  performance  of the TOPIX Index was 20.21%.  The TOPIX Index
continued its rising trend from the middle of 2005 until mid-January 2006, moved
up and down in January and February,  and moved up a little further during March
and April.  The rise was quite fast in the latter  half of 2005,  when the TOPIX
Index  advanced  40.1% over a  six-month  period.  A sharp  decline in  January,
starting with the "Live-door Shock", appears to have occurred at a good time, as
the market adjusted  itself after the sudden,  sharp rise. The TOPIX Index stood
at 1177.20 at the end of June 2005,  at 1444.73 by the end of October,  and rose
to 1649.76 by the end of  December  2005.  The Index  dipped  back to 1574.67 on
January 18, 2006,  but stayed in a range  between  roughly 1600 and 1700 through
the end of March.  The TOPIX  reached its highest  point of the year on April 7,
2006, hitting 1783.72, and finished April at a level of 1716.43.

     The market experienced heavy trading volume, and renewed the record for the
largest  transaction  value,  during  January 2006, as more than (Y)30  trillion
worth of stocks traded on the TSE 1st section.  Individual investors became very
active   participants  in  the  stock  market,   while  domestic   institutions,
particularly  trust banks,  were  consistent  sellers of stocks over the period.
Small-cap  stocks,  which had led the market in the last months of 2005,  turned
into poor performers in 2006 after the Livedoor Shock hit the market. Reflecting
the record trading volume levels,  the securities  brokerage sector was the best
performer over the six months ended April 30, 2006,  posting a 45.1% return. The
non-ferrous  metals sector  performed  second best with a 38.4% gain,  partially
reflecting the strong  advance in precious metal prices.  The real estate sector
performed  third,  with a 34.7% return.  Real estate stocks  performed well with
signs of a bottoming-out of land prices in Japan after 15 years of decline. Some
of the top performing  sectors during earlier  periods turned out to be laggards
this time around.  The shipping  sector,  which had  performed  well in previous
months,  turned out to be the worst-performing  sector this period with a return
of -1.0%. The  cargo-shipping  charge market declined over the period,  after an
extremely fast rise earlier on. The telecommunication  carriers sector ended the
period flat,  ranking  second worst in  performance,  as the fierce  competition
expected among incumbent operators and new entrants kept investors' expectations
low. The third worst  performing  sector was oil & coal, up 2.5%, which had also
been a strong performer in the previous period.

     The  TOPIX  Index  stood at 1445 at the end of  October  and  rose  along a
straight line to reach almost 1700 by early January 2006.  Technology stocks led
the  market in  November,  while  smaller  stocks  performed  extremely  well in
December.  In January,  the TOPIX Index recorded its ninth consecutive  positive
monthly return.  In the middle of the month,  there was a sudden and sizable dip
in the indices,  but the major indices  rebounded  during the latter half of the
month to finish with positive  returns.  With high  volatility,  the total trade
value on the TSE 1st section  reached its  highest  level in history,  with more
than (Y)31 trillion (counting one-way trades) worth of stocks traded in January.
The TSE suffered from system troubles attempting to handle the increased trading
volume,  and the Exchange  shortened its daily trading hours. The Livedoor Shock
affected the market  significantly,  as Livedoor is a young company with various
interests  in  internet-related  businesses.  Prosecutors  raided the company on
January  17th  for  alleged  market  manipulation  and  accounting  fraud.  Four
executives  of  Livedoor,  including  the CEO and CFO (who  have  both  recently
resigned),  have  been  arrested.  Allegedly,  Livedoor  executives  manipulated
publicly-announced  accounting data and made deceptive statements regarding past
acquisitions and equity issuances while the company experienced a phase of rapid
expansion  via a series of  acquisitions.  With the  popularity of the company's
former President,  Livedoor was a favorite of some individual investors.  As the
share price of Livedoor took a nose dive,  from (Y)696 on January 16th to (Y)119
on January 26th, on limited trading volume,  the seemingly  excessive heat among
investors towards  internet-related  stocks cooled down. Livedoor's share price,
which  stood at (Y)107 at the end of  January,  had dropped to (Y)94 by the time
the shares were delisted on April 13th.

     Overall,  however,  results announced by Japanese companies for the quarter
ended December 31, 2005 were generally  fine.  Matsushita,  Toyota and Mazda all
announced  results and  indications  that were above market  expectations.  Many
other companies met expectations, but the market did not have much of a reaction
to the good news. Instead,  the share prices of companies that reported negative
surprises,  including  shipping  companies  Nippon  Yusen and Mitsui  OSK,  sank
quickly.   Constant  selling  pressure  from  domestic  financial  institutions,
together with sizable sell-offs by individuals in the first week of February and
by non-residents in the second week,  appears to have led the market downward in
the early part of February.  The quick report of Goss Domestic  Product  ("GDP")
for the quarter ended  December 31, 2005 was a 4.2%  year-on-year  ("YoY") gain,
above market expectations. The turning point came on March 9th, when the Bank of
Japan  announced that it would end  "quantitative  easing" to effectively  cease
maintaining  Japan's extremely high money supply level. With the news, the yield
on the 10-year  Japanese  government bond ("JGB") rose. After ending February at
1.60%,  the 10-year  JGB yield rose to 1.78% by the end of March,  and jumped to
almost 2% by the  middle  of  April,  ending  the  month at  1.93%.  Land  price
statistics,  announced in late March, showed that land prices were bottoming-out
after 15 years of  decline.  The share  prices of major real  estate  operators,
including  Mitsubishi  Real Estate,  Mitsui  Fudosan and  Sumitomo  Real Estate,
advanced strongly. Separately, prices returned to an up-trend in April.

     Concerns over the Chinese economy drew  investors'  attention once again in
April over China's interest rate increase. The Japanese Yen and other currencies
strengthened  against the U.S.  Dollar as the market  expected a slow-down or an
end to interest rate hikes in the United  States.  The Japanese  Yen,  which was
trading at around  (Y)110/US$  at the end of August  2005,  quickly  weakened to
(Y)121/US$ by early December and then  strengthened in January 2006. In February
and March, the Yen traded around (Y)Y116-(Y)118/US$,  before strengthening again
to end April at (Y)113.81/US$.  Macro-economic  statistics  announced throughout
the period were generally  healthy and positive,  and nationwide  Consumer Price
Index ("CPI")  figures were positive for four  successive  months through March.
Retail  sales  statistics  have been  positive  and  industrial  production  has
remained  strong.  Machinery orders have also generally showed a positive trend.
Also,  the  country's  unemployment  rate  declined  to 4.1% in March.  Earnings
announcements  for the quarter ended March 31, 2006,  and for the year to March,
have  generally  been  in-line  with  expectations  thus  far.  Canon  announced
better-than-expected  results, helped by improved office equipment sales and the
favorable  currency trend. Honda shares rose 5% after the company announced good
results and a dividend  increase.  Consumer  finance  companies  and credit card
operators  have  performed  poorly  in  2006,  as  rising  interest  rates  were
interpreted as a negative by investors.  News of the possible  introduction of a
new law to lower maximum interest charges,  resulting from the excessive conduct
by some  consumer  finance  companies  to urge  repayment,  also had an  adverse
effect.

Outlook

     In  conclusion,  the Japanese  economy seems to have  recovered to a normal
state, and has improved  significantly  after the long-lasting  deterioration of
the past two years. The start of the economic recovery was export driven,  after
which  industrial  activities  began to improve.  In the latter half of 2005, we
began  to see  signs of a  recovery  in  personal  consumption,  with  retailers
reporting  improved sales  statistics.  In addition,  the country's  major banks
successfully  cleared  most of  their  bad debt in 2005.  Consumer  prices  also
finally turned  positive from the end of 2005. In March 2006, land prices in the
central  cities  rebounded  and showed  signs of recovery  in other  statistical
areas.  The stock market  advanced  rapidly in the latter half of 2005, as if it
was beginning to incorporate the country's economic recovery. However, after its
quick rise at the end of 2005, the market has moved largely sideways thus far in
2006.

     We hold an optimistic  view of the stock market in the long run because the
Japanese  economy has finally  escaped from its long slump and appears likely to
remain healthy. In the short-term,  as most domestic factors have already turned
positive and/or neutral to the stock market,  the market might require some more
time to adjust  after its fast rise of the  recent  past.  For the  moment,  any
potential  negative  effects  on the  market  would  seem to come from  external
factors, including the economic states of Japan's major economic partners and/or
unexpected movements in currencies, commodities, energy, etc.

     In  general,  Japanese  companies  appear to be  continuing  their  healthy
operations, with further improvements in profits expected to come in the future.
Although indications by companies have not been as forthcoming as some investors
had expected,  they are a comfortable improvement from the period which has just
concluded.

     After a period of some more temporary  adjustments,  we expect the Japanese
stock market to yield healthy returns.

Notes to Financial Statements

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

     The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Maryland on
July 12, 1990 under its former name "The Japan Emerging  Equity Fund,  Inc." and
commenced  operations on July 24, 1992. It is registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a closed-end, diversified management investment company.

     The  following  significant  accounting  policies  are in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in the United States of America for
investment companies. Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual reporting  results
could differ from those estimates.

     Valuation  of  Investments--Securities  which are listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange  or listed on the  over-the-counter  market in Japan or listed on other
exchanges in Japan and for which market  quotations  are readily  available  are
valued at the last  reported  sales price  available to the Fund at the close of
business on the day the  securities are being valued or, lacking any such sales,
at the last available bid price. In instances  where  quotations are not readily
available or where the price as determined by the above procedures is deemed not
to represent fair market value,  fair value will be determined in such manner as
the Board of Directors  (the  "Board")  may  prescribe.  Short-term  investments
having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost,  except where
the Board  determines  that such  valuation does not represent the fair value of
the  investment.  All other  securities  and  assets are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board.

     Foreign  Currency  Translation--The  books  and  records  of the  Fund  are
maintained in U.S. dollars as follows:  (1) the foreign currency market value of
investment  securities and other assets and  liabilities  stated in Japanese yen
are  translated at the exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period;  and
(2) purchases, sales, income and expenses are translated at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.  The resulting exchange
gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations.  The Fund does not
isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign  exchange rates from the effect of
fluctuations in the market price of securities.

     Tax Status--The Fund intends to continue to distribute substantially all of
its  taxable  income  and to  comply  with the  minimum  distribution  and other
requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment
companies.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for federal  income or excise  taxes is
required.

     The Fund is not  subject to any  Japanese  income,  capital  gains or other
taxes except for withholding taxes on certain income, generally imposed at rates
of 7% on interest and dividends, paid to the Fund by Japanese corporations.

     Investment Transactions and Investment Income--Investment  transactions are
recorded  on the trade  date  (the  date upon  which the order to buy or sell is
executed).  Realized and  unrealized  gains and losses from security and foreign
currency  transactions  are  calculated on the identified  cost basis.  Dividend
income and corporate actions are recorded  generally on the ex-date,  except for
certain  dividends and corporate  actions from Japanese  securities which may be
recorded after the ex-date, as soon as the Fund acquires  information  regarding
such dividends or corporate  actions.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual
basis.

     Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders--The Fund records dividends and
distributions payable to its shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of
dividends and distributions  from net investment income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance  with federal income tax  regulations,  which
may differ from generally accepted accounting  principles.  These book basis/tax
basis differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the
extent these differences are permanent in nature,  such amounts are reclassified
within  the  capital  accounts  based  on their  federal  tax  basis  treatment;
temporary   differences   do  not  require   reclassifications.   Dividends  and
distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in-capital.

Investment Manager and Investment Adviser

     The Fund has an Investment  Management  Agreement with Daiwa SB Investments
(U.S.A.)  Ltd.  (the  "Manager").  Daiwa  SB  Investments  Ltd.  ("DSBI"  or the
"Adviser"),  an affiliate of the Manager,  acts as the Fund's investment adviser
pursuant to an Investment  Advisory  Agreement between the Manager and DSBI. For
such investment services, the Fund is obligated to pay the Manager a monthly fee
at an  annual  rate of 0.60% of the  first  $20  million,  0.40% of the next $30
million and 0.20% of the excess over $50  million of the Fund's  average  weekly
net assets,  of which fee 60% is paid by the Manager to DSBI.  In addition,  the
Fund has agreed to reimburse  the Manager and the Adviser for all  out-of-pocket
expenses  related  to the Fund.  For the six months  ended  April 30,  2006,  no
out-of-pocket expenses were paid to the Manager or Adviser.

     At April 30, 2006, the Fund owed $33,454 to the Manager.

Administrator and Custodian and Other Related Parties

     Daiwa  Securities  Trust  Company  ("DSTC"),  an  affiliate of the Adviser,
provides certain administrative services to the Fund, for which the Fund pays to
DSTC a monthly  fee at an annual  rate of 0.20% of the first $60  million of the
Fund's average weekly net assets, 0.15% of the next $40 million and 0.10% of the
excess over $100 million, with a minimum annual fee of $120,000. In addition, as
permitted by the Administration Agreement, the Fund reimburses the Administrator
for its  out-of-pocket  expenses  related to the Fund.  For the six months ended
April 30, 2006, no out-of-pocket expenses were paid to the Administrator.

     DSTC  also  acts as  custodian  for the  Fund's  assets  and has  appointed
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the  "Sub-Custodian"),  an affiliate of the
Manager,  to act as the  sub-custodian for all of the cash and securities of the
Fund held in Japan. As compensation for its services as custodian, DSTC receives
a monthly fee and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Such expenses include
fees and  out-of-pocket  expenses  of the  Sub-Custodian.  During the six months
ended April 30, 2006,  DSTC and the  Sub-Custodian  earned  $31,877 and $39,672,
respectively, as compensation for custodial service to the Fund.

     At April 30,  2006,  the Fund owed  $17,549,  $3,833 and $5,632 to DSTC for
administration,  compliance and custodian fees, respectively, excluding fees and

     During  the six  months  ended  April 30,  2006,  the Fund paid or  accrued
$32,232 for legal services in connection with the Fund's on-going  operations to
a law firm of which the Fund's Assistant Secretary is a partner.
