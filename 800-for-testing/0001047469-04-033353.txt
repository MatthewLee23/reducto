PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT

Dear Shareholders:

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust") is a diversified, closed-end management
investment company that seeks to provide investors with as high a level of
current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital. The Trust
seeks to achieve this objective by investing in a professionally managed
portfolio comprised primarily of senior loans.

PEFORMANCE SUMMARY

The Trust declared $0.11 of dividends during the second fiscal quarter and $0.21
for the six months ended August 31, 2004. Based on the average month-end net
asset value ("NAV") per share of $7.38, this resulted in an annualized
distribution rate of 5.74%(1) for the quarter and 5.68%(1) for the six months.
The Trust's total return for the second fiscal quarter, based on NAV, was 1.70%,
versus a total return on the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index of 1.11% for the same
quarter. For the six months, the total return, based on NAV, was 3.36%, versus
2.08% for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index. The total market value return
(based on full reinvestment of dividends) for the Trust's common shares during
the second fiscal quarter was 2.96% and 5.03% for the six months ended August
31, 2004.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The non-investment grade loan market continued to exhibit both technical and
fundamental strength during the most recent quarter. The primary drivers of loan
performance continue to be credit market conditions and liquidity, the overall
vigor of the U.S. economy, and the directional nature of short-term interest
rates. Each of these elements has been favorably aligned for virtually all of
this year; the most recent quarter offered no exception.

During the second calendar quarter of 2004, domestic GDP expanded at an
approximate 2.8% pace. While revised downward from earlier estimates, this pace
provides a solid footing from which most economists envision renewed
acceleration into 2005. Clearly, a vigorous economic backdrop is an essential
ingredient to a sustained level of corporate merger and acquisition ("M&A")
activity, and in turn, a hearty pipeline of new loan transactions. Coinciding
with increasingly robust growth, third quarter M&A-related loan volumes posted
their highest totals

- ----------
(1)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing dividends declared
     during the period and dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the
     Trust's average month-end net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the
     average month-end NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of Market). The
     distribution rate is based solely on the actual dividends and
     distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The
     distribution rate may or may not include all investment income and
     ordinarily will not include capital gains or losses, if any.

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT (continued)

since the second quarter of 2000. Further, as the economy continues to expand,
even at a somewhat uneven pace, and as commodity prices move ever upward, so has
the expectation of a continued rise in short-term interest rates. Importantly,
unlike fixed rate bonds, returns for which are inversely related to changes in
interest rates, the loan asset class, by way of its floating rate profile, is
expected to benefit as rates rise. Rounding out the triumvirate of positive
factors affecting the loan market, credit trends continue to look relatively
stable. Trailing default rates continue to hover near historical lows, and the
percentage of the market comprised of loans rated CCC+ or lower by Standard &
Poor's recently fell to a level not seen in roughly six years.

For the considerable number of favorable trends impacting the loan market, there
are a small number of emerging issues that offer a degree of pause. The price of
oil, for one, if sustained at current levels, will certainly have a crimping
effect on the pace of economic growth, and more specifically, those corporations
that use crude oil as a direct or indirect input. Moreover, strong demand for
loans, coupled with high levels of uninvested cash in the hands of investors,
has bred a bit of an issuer's market. Not unexpectedly, as a result, we've seen
both the compression of borrowing spreads to historical lows over the last few
quarters and an increasing inflow of slightly lower quality loans coming to
market. We are actively monitoring each of these developments.

PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW

The Trust during the quarter benefited from the robust supply of new loans
(permitting continued full investment), ongoing broad-based price support due to
strong demand for floating rate assets, and solid performance by several of the
Trust's larger individual holdings. Early in the quarter, the Trust increased
its exposure to the healthcare sector to 7.3% of total assets at quarter-end, as
several large cap issuers in the medical device sub-sector came to market. We
continue to view favorably this component of the healthcare industry due to high
barriers to entry and relative stability of cash flows. Conversely, exposure to
the cellular industry declined to 5.2% of total assets as Nextel Finance
Company, the bellwether issuer in the sector, significantly reduced its loan
facility. Following in Nextel's path, several other issuers in the sector also
took advantage of robust market conditions to refinance existing debt balances
and improve liquidity.

We continue to maintain a high level of diversification of the portfolio, across
both issuer and industry lines. As of August 31, 2004, the average individual
position accounted for approximately

                                        3

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT (continued)

0.23% of the Trust's total assets, while the average amount invested per
industry amounted to approximately 2.60% of total assets.

USE OF LEVERAGE

The Trust utilizes financial leverage to seek to increase the yield to the
holders of common shares. As of August 31, 2004, the Trust had $450 million of
"Aaa/AAA(2)" rated cumulative auction rate preferred shares outstanding, and
$473 million of borrowings outstanding under $525 million in available credit
facilities. Total leverage, as a percentage of total assets (including preferred
shares), was 45.69% at period end. The use of leverage for investment purposes
increases both investment opportunity and investment risk.

OUTLOOK

Fundamentally, our near-term outlook for the loan asset class remains positive.
Investor demand for floating rate loans, already at a level not seen in several
years, is expected to remain quite healthy if the Federal Reserve continues on
its path of systematically increasing short-term interest rates. Strong demand
typically translates into firm loan prices and stable net asset values. Further,
at this point, there appears to be little on the immediate horizon that would
threaten what is currently viewed as a fairly benign non-investment grade credit
environment. We are on watch, however, for increasingly aggressive transaction
structures (e.g., second lien and covenant-light loan facilities). Our strategy
remains focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. As in the past,
we will continue to forfeit yield in order to maintain credit discipline.

We thank you for your investment in ING Prime Rate Trust.

INDEX DESCRIPTIONS

The CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LEVERAGED LOAN INDEX is an unmanaged index of
below investment grade loans designed to mirror the investable universe of the
U.S. dollar-denominated leveraged loan market. An investor cannot invest
directly in an index.

The S&P/LSTA LEVERAGED LOAN INDEX ("LLI") is an unmanaged total return index
that captures accrued interest, repayments, and market value changes. It
represents a broad cross section of leveraged loans syndicated in the United
States, including dollar-denominated loans to overseas issuers. Standard &
Poor's and the Loan Syndications & Trading Association ("LSTA") conceived the
LLI to establish a performance benchmark for the syndicated leveraged loan
industry. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.

(A)  Yield is calculated by dividing the Trust's net investment income per share
     for the most recent thirty days by the net asset value (in the case of NAV)
     or the NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of market) at quarter-end.
     Yield calculations do not include any commissions or sales charges, and are
     compounded for six months and annualized for a twelve-month period to
     derive the Trust's yield consistent with the SEC standardized yield formula
     for investment companies.

(B)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing each monthly dividend,
     then averaging the annualized dividends declared for each month during the
     quarter and dividing the resulting average annualized dividend amount by
     the Trust's average net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE
     Composite closing price (in the case of Market) at the end of the period.

PRINCIPAL RISK FACTOR(s): This closed-end Fund may invest in below investment
grade senior loans. Investment in the Fund involves the risk that borrowers may
default on obligations, or that lenders may have difficulty liquidating the
collateral securing the loans or enforcing their rights under the terms of the
senior loans. Senior loans are subject to credit risks and the potential for
non-payment of scheduled principal or interest payments, which may result in a
reduction of the Fund's NAV. The use of leverage for investment purposes
increases both investment opportunity and investment risk. In the event of a
general market decline in the value of assets such as those in which the Fund
invests, the effect of that decline will be magnified in the Fund because of the
additional assets purchased with the proceeds of the leverage.

INTEREST RATE RISK: Changes in market interest rates will affect the yield on
the Fund's Common Shares. If market interest rates fall, the yield on the Fund's
Common Shares will also fall. In addition, changes in market interest rates may
cause the Fund's NAV to experience moderate volatility because of the lag
between changes in market rates and the resetting of the floating rates on
assets in the Fund's portfolio. To the extent that market interest rate changes
are reflected as a change in the market spreads for loans of the type and
quality in which the Fund invests, the value of the Fund's portfolio may
decrease in response to an increase in such spreads. Finally, substantial
increases in interest rates may cause an increase in loan defaults as borrowers
may lack the resources to meet higher debt service requirements.

(1)  Total investment return calculations are attributable to common shares.
(2)  Total investment return measures the change in the market value of your
     investment assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gain
     distributions, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust's
     dividend reinvestment plan.
(3)  Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a
     purchase at net asset value at the beginning of each period and a sale at
     net asset value at the end of each period and assumes reinvestment of
     dividends and capital gain distributions in accordance with the provisions
     of the dividend reinvestment plan. This calculation differs from total
     investment return because it excludes the effects of changes in the market
     values of the Trust's shares.
(4)  Asset coverage represents the total assets available for settlement of
     Preferred Stockholder's interest and notes payables in relation to the
     Preferred Shareholder interest and notes payable balance outstanding. The
     Preferred Shares were first offered November 2, 2000.

                              ING Prime Rate Trust

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of August 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust"), a Massachusetts business trust, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"), as a diversified, closed-end, management investment company. The Trust
invests primarily in senior loans which are exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "`33 Act"), but which contain certain
restrictions on resale and cannot be sold publicly. These loans bear interest
(unless otherwise noted) at rates that float periodically at a margin above the
Prime Rate of a U.S. bank specified in the credit agreement, the London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), the certificate of deposit rate, or in some
cases another base lending rate.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the
United States of America for investment companies.

A.   SENIOR LOAN AND OTHER SECURITY VALUATION. Senior loans held by the Trust
     are normally valued at the mean of the means of one or more bid and ask
     quotations obtained from an independent pricing service or other sources
     determined by the Board of Trustees to be independent and believed to be
     reliable. Loans for which reliable market value quotations are not readily
     available may be valued with reference to another loan or a group of loans
     for which reliable quotations are readily available and whose
     characteristics are comparable to the loan being valued. Under this
     approach, the comparable loan or loans serve as a proxy for changes in
     value of the loan being valued.

     The Trust has engaged an independent pricing service to provide readily
     available, reliable market value quotations from dealers in loans and, when
     such quotations are not readily available, to calculate values under the
     proxy procedure described above. As of August 31, 2004, 98.4% of total
     investments were valued based on these procedures. It is expected that most
     of the loans held by the Trust will continue to be valued with reference to
     quotations from the independent pricing service or with reference to the
     proxy procedure described above.

     Prices from a pricing source may not be available for all loans and ING
     Investments, LLC (the "Investment Manager") or ING Investment Management
     Co. (formerly, Aeltus Investment Management, Inc.) ("ING IM" the
     "Sub-Adviser"), may believe that the price for a loan derived from market
     quotations or the proxy procedure described above is not reliable or
     accurate. Among other reasons, this may be the result of information about
     a particular loan or borrower known to the Investment Manager or the
     Sub-Adviser that the Investment Manager or the Sub-Adviser believes may not
     be known to the pricing service or reflected in a price quote. In this
     event, the loan is valued at fair value as determined in good faith under
     procedures established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance
     with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Under these procedures, fair value is
     determined by the Investment Manager and monitored by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees through its Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee. In fair valuing
     a loan, consideration is given to several factors, which may include, among
     others, the following: (i) the characteristics of and fundamental
     analytical data relating to the loan, including the cost, size, current
     interest rate, period until the next interest rate reset, maturity and base
     lending rate of the loan, the terms and conditions of the loan and any
     related agreements, and the position of the loan in the borrower's debt
     structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including
     the Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral;
     (iii) the creditworthiness of the borrower and the cash flow coverage of
     outstanding principal and interest, based on an evaluation of its financial
     condition, financial statements and information about the borrower's
     business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of August 31, 2004 (Unaudited) (continued)

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (iv) information relating to the market for the loan, including price
     quotations for, and trading in, the loan and interests in similar loans;
     (v) the reputation and financial condition of the agent for the loan and
     any intermediate participants in the loan; (vi) the borrower's management;
     and (vii) the general economic and market conditions affecting the fair
     value of the loan. Securities for which the primary market is a national
     securities exchange are valued at the last reported sale price. Securities
     reported by NASDAQ will be valued at the NASDAQ official closing price.
     Securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
     which no sale was reported on a valuation date are valued at the mean
     between the last reported bid and ask price on such exchange. Securities
     other than senior loans for which reliable market value quotations are not
     readily available and all other assets will be valued at their respective
     fair values as determined in good faith by, and under procedures
     established by, the Board of Trustees of the Trust. Investments in
     securities maturing in less than 60 days from the date of valuation are
     valued at amortized cost, which, when combined with accrued interest
     approximates market value.

B.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. It is the Trust's policy to comply with subchapter M
     of the Internal Revenue Code and related excise tax provisions applicable
     to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of
     its net investment income and net realized capital gains to its
     shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. No
     capital gain distributions will be made by the Trust until any capital loss
     carryforwards have been fully utilized or expire.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revolver and delayed draw
     loans are booked on a settlement date basis. Security transactions and
     senior loans are accounted for on trade date (date the order to buy or sell
     is executed). Realized gains or losses are reported on the basis of
     identified cost of securities sold. Dividend income is recognized on the
     ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis at the
     then-current interest rate of the loan. The accrual of interest on loans is
     discontinued when, in the opinion of management, there is an indication
     that the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. Upon
     such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Cash
     collections on non-accrual senior loans are generally applied as a
     reduction to the recorded investment of the loan. Senior loans are
     generally returned to accrual status only after all past due amounts have
     been received. For all loans acquired prior to March 1, 2001, arrangement
     fees received, which represent non-refundable fees associated with the
     acquisition of loans, are deferred and recognized over the shorter of 2.5
     years or the actual terms of the loan. For all loans, except revolving
     credit facilities, acquired subsequent to February 28, 2001, fees received
     are treated as discounts and are accreted whereas premiums are amortized.
     Fees associated with revolving credit facilities acquired subsequent to
     February 28, 2001 are deferred and recognized over the shorter of four
     years or the actual term of the loan.

D.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. The Trust declares dividends monthly
     for net investment income. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are
     declared and paid annually. The Trust may make additional distributions to
     comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The
     character and amounts of income and gains to be distributed are determined
     in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from
     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
     for investment companies. Dividends paid by the Trust from net investment
     income and distributions of net realized short-term capital gains are, for
     federal income tax purposes, taxable as ordinary income to shareholders.
     The Trust records distributions to its shareholders on the ex-dividend
     date.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of August 31, 2004 (Unaudited) (continued)

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E.   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENTS. Pursuant to the Trust's Shareholder Investment
     Program (formerly known as the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan), DST
     Systems, Inc., the Plan Agent, purchases, from time to time, shares of
     beneficial interest of the Trust on the open market to satisfy dividend
     reinvestments. Such shares are purchased on the open market only when the
     closing sale or bid price plus commission is less than the net asset value
     per share of the Trust's common shares on the valuation date. If the market
     price plus commissions is equal to or exceeds the net asset value, new
     shares are issued by the Trust at the greater of (i) net asset value or
     (ii) the market price of the shares during the pricing period, minus a
     discount of 5%.

F.   USE OF ESTIMATES. Management of the Trust has made certain estimates and
     assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
     expenses and contingencies to prepare these financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States of America for investment companies. Actual results could differ
     from these estimates.

G.   SHARE OFFERINGS. Beginning in the year ended February 28, 1999, the Trust
     began issuing shares under various shelf registration statements, whereby
     the net proceeds received by the Trust from share sales may not be less
     than the greater of (i) the NAV per share or (ii) 94% of the average daily
     market price over the relevant pricing period.

NOTE 3 -- INVESTMENTS

For the six months ended August 31, 2004, the cost of purchases and the proceeds
from principal repayment and sales of investments, excluding short-term notes,
totaled $1,217,889,982 and $934,673,546, respectively. At August 31, 2004, the
Trust held senior loans valued at $1,945,548,616 representing 98.1% of its total
investments. The market value of these assets is established as set forth in
Note 2.

The senior loans acquired by the Trust typically take the form of a direct
lending relationship with the borrower, and are typically acquired through an
assignment of another lender's interest in a loan. The lead lender in a typical
corporate loan syndicate administers the loan and monitors the collateral
securing the loan.

Common and preferred shares, and stock purchase warrants held in the portfolio
were acquired in conjunction with loans held by the Trust. Certain of these
stocks and warrants are restricted and may not be publicly sold without
registration under the `33 Act, or without an exemption under the `33 Act. In
some cases, these restrictions expire after a designated period of time after
issuance of the shares or warrants.

NOTE 4 -- MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS

The Trust has entered into an Investment Management Agreement with the
Investment Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ING Fund Services, LLC (the
"Administrator"), to provide advisory and management services. The Investment
Management Agreement compensates the Investment Manager with a fee, computed
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.80% of the Trust's Managed
Assets. For purposes of this Agreement, "Managed Assets" shall mean the Trust's
average daily gross asset value, minus the sum of the Trust's accrued and unpaid
dividends on any outstanding preferred shares and accrued liabilities (other
than liabilities for the principal amount of any borrowings incurred, commercial
paper or notes issued by the Trust and the liquidation preference of any
outstanding preferred shares).

The Investment Manager entered into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with ING IM, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ING Groep N.V., effective August 19, 2003. Subject to
such policies as the Board or the Investment Manager may determine, ING IM
manages the Trust's assets in accordance with the Trust's investment objectives,
policies, and limitations.

The Trust has also entered into an Administration Agreement with the
Administrator to provide administrative services and also to furnish facilities.
The Administrator is compensated with a fee, computed daily and payable monthly,
at an annual rate of 0.25% of the Trust's average daily Managed Assets.

as defined in the plan agreement.

NOTE 6 -- COMMITMENTS

The Trust has entered into both a $90 million 364-day revolving credit agreement
which matures on August 25, 2005 and a $435 million 364-day revolving
securitization facility which matures on June 13, 2005, collateralized by assets
of the Trust. Borrowing rates under these agreements are based on a fixed spread
over LIBOR, the federal funds rate, or a commercial paper-based rate. Prepaid
arrangement fees for these facilities are amortized over the term of the
agreements. The amount of borrowings outstanding at August 31, 2004, was $473
million. Weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 1.99%,
excluding fees related to the unused portion of the facilities, and other fees.
The amount of borrowings represented 23.42% of total assets at August 31, 2004.
Average borrowings for the six months ended August 31, 2004 were $387,448,370
and the average annualized interest rate was 1.93% excluding other fees related
to the unused portion of the facilities, and other fees.

</Table>

On November 2, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares each of Series M, Series W
and Series F Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $270 million. Also, on November
16, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares of Series T and Series Th Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000, liquidation preference,
for a total issuance of $180 million. Costs associated with the offering of
approximately $5,438,664 were charged against the proceeds received. The Trust
used the net proceeds of the offering to partially pay down the then existing
indebtedness and to purchase additional senior loans. Preferred Shares pay
dividends based on a rate set at auctions, normally held every 7 days. In most
instances dividends are also payable every 7 days, on the first business day
following the end of the rate period.

NOTE 8 -- CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT

State Street Bank and Trust Company ("SSB") serves as the Trust's custodian and
recordkeeper. Custody fees paid to SSB are reduced by earnings credits based on
the cash balances held by SSB for the Trust. There were no earnings credits for
the six months ended August 31, 2004.

NOTE 9 -- SUBORDINATED LOANS AND UNSECURED LOANS

The Trust may invest in subordinated loans and in unsecured loans. The primary
risk arising from investing in subordinated loans or in unsecured loans is the
potential loss in the event of default by the issuer of the loans. The Trust may
acquire a subordinated loan only if, at the time of acquisition, it acquires or
holds a senior loan from the same borrower. The Trust will acquire unsecured
loans only where the Investment Manager believes, at the time of acquisition,
that the Trust would have the right to payment upon default that is not
subordinate to any other creditor. The Trust may invest up to 5% of its total
assets, measured at the time of investment, in subordinated loans and unsecured
loans. As of August 31, 2004, the Trust held 0.48% of its total assets in
subordinated loans and unsecured loans.

NOTE 10 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Permanent differences are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences are not reclassified.
Key differences include the treatment of short-term capital gains and wash sale
deferrals. Distributions in excess of net investment income and/or net realized
capital gains for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in capital.

Dividends paid by the Trust from net investment income and distributions of net
realized short-term capital gains are, for federal income tax purposes, taxable
as ordinary income to shareholders.

The tax composition of dividends and distributions to shareholders was as
follows:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT PROGRAM

The Trust offers a Shareholder Investment Program (the "Program," formerly known
as the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan) which allows holders of the
Trust's common shares a simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional common shares of the Trust. The Program
also offers holders of the Trust's common shares the ability to make optional
cash investments in any amount from $100 to $100,000 on a monthly basis.

For dividend reinvestment purposes, DST Systems, Inc. will purchase shares of
the Trust on the open market when the market price plus estimated commissions is
less than the net asset value on the valuation date. The Trust will issue new
shares for dividend reinvestment purchases when the market price plus estimated
commissions is equal to or exceeds the net asset value on the valuation date.
New shares may be issued at the greater of (i) net asset value or (ii) the
market price of the shares during the pricing period, minus a discount of 5%.

For optional cash investments, shares will be purchased on the open market by
the DST Systems, Inc. when the market price plus estimated commissions is less
than the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares will be issued by the
Trust for optional cash investments when the market price plus estimated
commissions is equal to or exceeds the net asset value on the valuation date.
Such shares will be issued at a discount to market, determined by the Trust,
between 0% and 5%.

There is no charge to participate in the Program. Participants may elect to
discontinue participation in the Program at any time. Participants will share,
on a PRORATA basis, in the fees or expenses of any shares acquired in the open
market.

Participation in the Program is not automatic. If you would like to receive more
information about the Program or if you desire to participate, please contact
your broker or the Trust's Shareholder Services Department at (800) 992-0180.
