Muni Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc.


Semi-Annual Report
November 30, 2004


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders
with high current income exempt from federal income taxes by
investing primarily in a portfolio of municipal obligations, the
interest on which, in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer, is
exempt from federal income taxes.

This report, including the financial information herein, is
transmitted to shareholders of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.
for their information. It is not a prospectus. The Fund has
leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain leveraged by
issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks
for Common Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater
volatility of net asset value and market price of shares of the
Common Stock, and the risk that fluctuations in the short-term
dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect the yield to Common
Stock shareholders. Past performance results shown in this report
should not be considered a representation of future performance.
Statements and other information herein are as dated and are subject
to change.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses
to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities
is available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling toll-free
1-800-MER-FUND (1-800-637-3863); (2) at www.mutualfunds.ml.com;

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek
to enhance the yield and net asset value of its Common Stock.
However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate
environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which
pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests
the proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on
these investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to
Common Stock shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of
these portfolio holdings is reflected in the per share net asset
value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to benefit
Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively
sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-
term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If
either of these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will
begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock
capitalization of $100 million and the issuance of Preferred
Stock for an additional $50 million, creating a total value of
$150 million available for investment in long-term municipal bonds.
If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3% and
long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million
of Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At
the same time, the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the
income based on long-term interest rates. Of course, increases in
short-term interest rates would reduce (and even eliminate) the
dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term
investments, and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the
beneficiaries of the incremental yield. However, if short-term
interest rates rise, narrowing the differential between short-term
and long-term interest rates, the incremental yield pickup on the
Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At the same
time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its
price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a result,
decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price
of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the fund's
Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in
net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain
securities whose potential income return is inversely related to
changes in a floating interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In
general, income on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term
interest rates increase and increase when short-term interest rates
decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of
reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested
principal. In addition, inverse floaters have the effect of
providing investment leverage and, as a result, the market value
of such securities will generally be more volatile than that of
fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests
in inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and
the net asset value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile
than if the Fund did not invest in such securities. As of November
30, 2004, none of the Fund's total net assets were invested in
inverse floaters.


Swap Agreements


The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-
counter contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic
payments based on the change in market value of a specified bond,
basket of bonds or index in return for periodic payments based on a
fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market value of a
different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be
used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk
that the party with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will
default on its obligation to pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund
will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to
the agreement.

A Letter From the President


Dear Shareholder

As we ended the current reporting period, several topics weighed
heavily on investors' minds. Among them were questions about
economic growth, corporate earnings, interest rates and inflation,
politics, the price of oil and terrorism - all issues that are worth
addressing here.

While the pace of economic expansion slowed somewhat between
the first and second quarters of 2004, gross domestic product
reaccelerated in the third quarter and is expected to approach 4%
for the year. The generally favorable economic environment has
benefited American corporations, which continued to post strong
earnings. Although the extraordinary results seen in 2004 are likely
to moderate in 2005, solid productivity, improved revenue growth and
cost discipline all point to a vital corporate sector.

In terms of inflation and interest rates, the Federal Reserve Board
has signaled its confidence in the economic recovery by increasing
the Federal Funds target rate five times since June 2004, from 1% to
2.25% as of the December 14 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Inflation, for its part, has remained fairly subdued.

While the re-election of President Bush was generally viewed as
business-friendly, the rising price of oil continued to be a concern
for consumers and corporations. But even having exceeded $50 per
barrel recently, the situation is far from the crisis proportions
we saw in the 1980s. Lastly, but importantly, terrorism and
geopolitical tensions are unwelcome realities we are forced to live
with today. Historically, however, the financial effects of any
single event tend to be short-lived.

Amid the uncertainty, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index
posted a 12-month return of +4.07% and a six-month return of +4.30%
as of November 30, 2004. Long-term bond yields were volatile, but
ultimately little changed, over the past year.

The key during uncertain times is to remain focused on the big
picture. Investment success comes not from reacting to short-term
volatility, but from maintaining a long-term perspective and
adhering to the disciplines of asset allocation, diversification and
rebalancing. We encourage you to work with your financial advisor to
ensure these time-tested techniques are incorporated into your
investment plan.

Finally, after 35 years in the asset management business, it is
with great satisfaction and some nostalgia that I embark on my
retirement, effective January 1, 2005. The industry has evolved
significantly over the past three and a half decades, and I am
privileged to have been a part of it. I wish you continued success
as you pursue your investment goals and, as always, I thank you for
allowing Merrill Lynch Investment Managers to be a part of your
financial life.



Sincerely,



(Terry K. Glenn)

President and Director

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager


The Fund outperformed its comparable Lipper category average and was
effectively able to enhance yield while preserving net asset value
in a volatile interest rate environment.


Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past six months, long-term bond yields declined as their
prices, which move in the opposite direction, increased. The rise in
bond prices came as somewhat of a surprise, as the economy generally
continued to improve. Gross domestic product growth was recently
estimated at 3.7% for the third quarter of 2004, up from 3.4% in the
second quarter. However, recent improvements in domestic business
activity have been offset by modest inflation measures.

For its part, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) raised its short-
term interest rate target to 1.25% in June, the first change in
more than a year. In its accompanying statement, the Fed called
for a "measured" approach to interest rate increases, removing much
of the earlier concern that it might embark on a dramatic series
of increases. The prospect for a more moderate tightening sequence
helped support higher bond prices, despite additional Fed rate
increases in August, September, November and December, which raised
the Federal Funds target rate to 2.25%. Long-term Treasury bond
yields stood at 5% at period-end, a decline of 29 basis points
(.29%) over the past six months. The 10-year Treasury note yield was
4.35%, 23 basis points lower than six months earlier.

The municipal bond market benefited from a generally supportive
technical environment throughout the six-month period. Consequently,
while tax-exempt bond yields followed the same pattern as their
taxable counterparts, yield volatility was more subdued than in the
Treasury market. Long-term revenue bond yields, as measured by the
Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, fell 19 basis points over the six
months. As reported by Municipal Market Data, AAA-rated issues
maturing in 30 years saw their yields decline 26 basis points to
4.76% over the past six months, while yields on 10-year, AAA-rated
issues declined 29 basis points to 3.66%.

During the period, more than $175 billion in new long-term tax-
exempt bonds was underwritten, a decline of nearly 12% versus the
same six months a year ago. The declining supply trend allowed tax-
exempt bond prices to register significant gains over the six
months.

Relative to Treasury issues, long-term tax-exempt bond yield ratios
have remained in the 88% - 93% range, above their recent historic
average of 85% - 88%. These attractive yield ratios should continue
to attract both traditional and non-traditional investors to the tax-
exempt market.


How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing
market conditions?

For the six-month period ended November 30, 2004, the Common Stock
of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields
of 5.67% and 6.32%, based on a period-end per share net asset value
of $15.19 and a per share market price of $13.64, respectively, and
$.432 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the total
investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +7.98%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $14.52 to $15.19, and
assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the
+6.34% average return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds
(Leveraged) category for the six-month period. (Funds in this Lipper
category invest primarily in municipal debt issues rated in the top
four credit-rating categories. These funds can be leveraged via use
of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase agreements.) The
Fund's outperformance is attributed to our focus on enhancing yield,
with credit selection driven by our team of 12 full-time credit
analysts. Entering the period, the Fund was overweight in the high
yield portion of the market, that being credit spreads. These issues
enjoyed strong performance during the period as investors became
increasingly comfortable assuming risk. Owning these higher-yielding
bonds helped boost the portfolio's yield and total return as
municipal credit spreads tightened. In addition, the advance
refunding of two bonds in the portfolio benefited performance as
these holdings realized a significant increase in their market
values.



MUNI INTERMEDIATE DURATION FUND, INC., NOVEMBER 30, 2004



For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a
change in the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as
measured by the trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York
Stock Exchange), and assuming reinvestment of dividends, please
refer to the Financial Highlights section of this report. As a
closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary market
at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the
Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment
returns based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Portfolio activity during the past six months was focused on
reducing the Fund's exposure to spread product - the lower-quality,
higher-yielding portion of the market that had performed so well. In
particular, we trimmed the Fund's exposure to credits rated BBB and
below, as these securities have significantly outperformed the
broader market over the past 18 months. The proceeds from the sales
were reinvested in the high-grade market, where we believe relative
value exists.

Purchases during the period were concentrated on California and New
Jersey tax-exempt bonds, both of which we found to be inexpensive on
a relative basis. In California, we increased exposure by purchasing
insured unified school district bonds, which have the potential to
be refunded. When a bond is refunded, the price will increase
significantly as the effective maturity is reduced to the first call
date. In New Jersey, an increase in the supply of municipal bonds
caused a temporarily weak technical market, offering us a compelling
buying opportunity.

We also started to rebalance the Fund's maturity exposure during the
period, moving further out on the municipal yield curve. The curve
is extremely steep by historical standards, making the 15-year to 20-
year segments quite expensive. The Fund had been concentrated in the
15-year to 20-year range since its inception. However, as these
segments outperformed the rest of the curve, we have taken the
opportunity to shift into longer maturities, favoring the 23-year to
28-year portions of the curve.

For the six-month period ended November 30, 2004, the Fund's Auction
Market Preferred Stock (AMPS) had an average yield of 1.10% for
Series M7, 1.09% for Series T7, 1.12% for Series W7, 1.14% for
Series TH7 and 1.13% for Series F7. These attractive funding levels,
in combination with the steep municipal yield curve, continued to
provide a significant income benefit to the Fund's Common Stock
shareholders from the leveraging of Preferred Stock. While the
Fed is likely to continue raising short-term interest rates, the
increases are expected to be gradual and should not have an
immediate material impact on the positive advantage leverage has
had on the Fund's Common Stock yield. However, should the spread
between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits
of leveraging will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the
Fund's Common Stock. At the end of the period, the Fund's leverage
amount, due to AMPS, was 33.03% of total net assets. (For a more
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see
page 2 of this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the
period?

At period end, our primary focus was on maintaining the portfolio's
current yield and protecting the Fund's net asset value in case of a
future rise in interest rates. We expect the economy to continue to
strengthen over the next several quarters, pushing interest rates
slightly higher. Against this backdrop, we will continue to reduce
our exposure to spread product and, within three to six months,
expect to have established a neutral portfolio weighting in this
area of the market.

as obtained by a pricing service. Pricing services use valuation
matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied valuations and
valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and
procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors
of the Fund. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which
are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing prices as of
the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are valued
at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In
the case of options traded in the over-the-counter market, valuation
is the last asked price (options written) or the last bid price
(options purchased). Swap agreements are valued by quoted fair
values received daily by the Fund's pricing service. Short-term
investments with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value, under which
method the investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount
is amortized on a straight line basis to maturity. Investments in
open-end investment companies are valued at their net asset value
each business day. Securities and other assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various
portfolio investment strategies both to increase the return of the
Fund and to hedge, or protect, its exposure to interest rate
movements and movements in the securities markets. Losses may arise
due to changes in the value of the contract or if the counterparty
does not perform under the contract.

* Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell
financial futures contracts and options on such futures contracts.
Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities
at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon
entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and maintains as
collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on which
the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund
agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal
to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or
payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund
as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the
value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed.

* Options--The Fund may write covered call options and purchase call
and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of
an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or
deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
(or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option
expires (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund
realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums
received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).



MUNI INTERMEDIATE DURATION FUND, INC., NOVEMBER 30, 2004



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Forward interest rate swaps--The Fund may enter into forward
interest rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and
the counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a specified
notional contract amount, commencing on a specified future effective
date, unless terminated earlier. When the agreement is closed, the
Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount equal to the value
of the agreement.

(c) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security
transactions are recorded on the dates the transactions are entered
into (the trade dates). Realized gains and losses on security
transactions are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates. Interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all premiums and
discounts on debt securities.

(e) Offering expenses--Direct expenses relating to the public
offering of the Fund's Common and Preferred Stock were charged to
capital at the time of issuance of the shares.

(f) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment
income are declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains
are recorded on the ex-dividend dates.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund
Asset Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is
Princeton Services, Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML & Co."), which is the
limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain
other services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such
services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .55% of
the Fund's average daily net assets, including proceeds from the
issuance of Preferred Stock. FAM has contractually agreed to waive a
portion of its fee during the first seven years of the Fund's
operations ending July 31, 2010, as follows:


                                          Fee Waiver
                                    (As a Percentage
                                    of Average Daily
                                         Net Assets)

Years 1 through 5                               .15%
Year 6                                          .10%
Year 7                                          .05%
Year 8 and thereafter                           .00%


FAM has not agreed to waive any portion of its fee beyond July 31,
2010.

For the six months ended November 30, 2004, FAM earned fees of
$2,355,368, of which $642,373 was waived.
