MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund

Dear Shareholder

We are pleased to submit the annual shareholder report for the Madison/Claymore
Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund") for the 12 months ended
December 31, 2007. Before a name change effective October 31, 2007, the Fund was
called the Madison/Claymore Covered Call Fund.

In connection with the decision to change the Fund's name, the Fund's Board of
Trustees approved a change to the Fund's previously effective non-fundamental
investment policy that the Fund employ, under normal market conditions, an
option strategy of writing (selling) covered call options on common stocks
comprising at least 80% of the total assets of the Fund. Under the revised
non-fundamental investment policy adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Fund will, under normal market conditions, allocate at least 80% of total assets
to an integrated investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests in a
portfolio of equity securities and writes (sells) covered call options against a
portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio; pending
investment in equity securities or covered call options, assets of the Fund
allocated to its integrated investment strategy will be held in cash or cash
equivalents.

The Fund's Board of Trustees also approved a change to the Fund's previously
effective non-fundamental investment policy that the Fund invest, under normal
market conditions, at least 65% of its total assets in common stocks of large
capitalization issuers that meet the Fund's selection criteria. Under the
revised non-fundamental investment policy adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, the Fund will, under normal market conditions, invest at least 65% of
its equity securities investments in common stocks of large capitalization
issuers that meet the Fund's selection criteria.

It is anticipated that the Fund's name change and revised investment policies
will provide greater flexibility in managing the Fund's portfolio of investments
in a manner consistent with the Fund's primary investment objective to seek a
high level of current income and current gains with a secondary objective of
long-term capital appreciation. The Fund pursues these objectives by investing
in a portfolio of what the Investment Manager believes to be high-quality, large
capitalization stocks that are trading at reasonable valuations in relation to
their long-term earnings growth rates. The Fund will, on an ongoing and
consistent basis, sell covered call options to seek to generate a reasonably
steady return from option premiums.

Madison Asset Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison Investment
Advisors, Inc., is the Fund's investment manager. Founded in 1974, Madison is an
independently owned firm that acts as an investment adviser for individuals,
corporations, pension funds, endowments, insurance companies and mutual funds.
Madison and its subsidiaries manage more than $9 billion in assets. Claymore
Advisors, LLC is the investment adviser to the Fund.

All Fund returns cited - whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price - assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the 12-month period
ended December 31, 2007, the Fund provided a total return based on market value
of -16.85%. This represents a closing market price of $11.41 on December 31,
2007, versus $15.11 on December 31, 2006. On an

continued


NAV basis, the Fund generated a total return of -3.81%. This represents an NAV
of $13.02 on December 31, 2007, versus $14.84 on December 31, 2006. The Fund's
market price at December 31, 2007, represented a discount to market value of
12.37%; as of December 31, 2006, the share price was at a 1.82% premium to NAV.

We encourage shareholders to consider the opportunity to reinvest their
distributions from the Fund through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP"),
which is described in detail on page 24 of the Fund's annual report. When shares
trade at a discount to NAV, the DRIP takes advantage of the discount by
reinvesting the quarterly dividend distribution in common shares of the Fund
purchased in the market at a price less than NAV. Conversely, when the market
price of the Fund's common shares is at a premium above NAV, the DRIP reinvests
participants' dividends in newly-issued common shares at NAV, subject to an IRS
limitation that the purchase price cannot be more than 5% below the market price
per share. The DRIP provides a cost-effective means to accumulate additional
shares and enjoy the benefits of compounding returns over time. Since the Fund
endeavors to maintain a steady quarterly distribution rate, the DRIP effectively
provides an income averaging technique, which causes shareholders to accumulate
a larger number of Fund shares when the market price is depressed than when the
price is higher.

During 2007 the Fund paid quarterly dividends of $.33 per share, for a total of
$1.32. This represents a distribution rate of 11.57% based on the Fund's closing
price of $11.41 on December 31, 2007. However, there is no guarantee that this
level of income will be maintained.

To learn more about the Fund's performance and investment strategy, we encourage
you to read the Questions & Answers section of the report, which begins on page
5. You will find information about Madison's investment philosophy and
discipline, its views on the market environment and how it structured the Fund's
portfolio based on its views.

We appreciate your investment and look forward to serving your investment needs
in the future. For the most up-to-date information on your investment, please

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

We at Madison Asset Management LLC are pleased to address the progress of the
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund") for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2007. Introduced in July 2004, the Fund continues to
pursue its investment objectives by investing in high-quality,
large-capitalization common stocks that are, in our view, selling at reasonable
prices with respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. Our option-writing
strategy has provided a steady stream of option premiums, which helps achieve
our goal of providing a high level of current income and current gains enhanced
risk-adjusted returns with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation.

Madison Asset Management, LLC, (MAM) a wholly owned subsidiary of Madison
Investment Advisors, Inc., with its affiliates, manages more than $9 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment, and mutual fund assets as
of December 31, 2007.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW HAVE THE FUND'S NAME CHANGE AND REVISED INVESTMENT PARAMETERS AFFECTED THE
WAY THE PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED?

We believe that the Fund's name change and revised investment policies provide
greater flexibility in managing the Fund's portfolio of investments in a manner
consistent with the Fund's primary investment objective, which is to seek a high
level of current income and current gains with a secondary objective of
long-term capital appreciation. While we welcome this enhanced flexibility,
there has not been any material change in the way we manage the portfolio.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MARKET DURING 2007?

The year ended December 31, 2007, will probably not be remembered for the new
highs or near highs the major indices hit in July. Instead, the key word for the
year will be one familiar to all readers of business publications or viewers of
business news: subprime. The credit problems that were under the surface for the
first part of the year broke into true crisis proportion by the early fall. Not
only did hundreds of thousands of Americans face losing their homes as
adjustable-rate mortgages kicked into higher rates, but financial institutions
that held securities based on lower-grade mortgages began to suffer significant
losses as the value of these securities declined.

A credit crisis was in full effect, as institutions were no longer willing to
lend to each other on favorable terms. Investors fled riskier stock investments
for more secure ones such as bonds with the highest ratings and cash, and
investors' fears were particularly negative for the fortunes of stocks in the
financial and consumer discretionary sectors. Meanwhile, the price of crude oil
inched up towards $100 per barrel, and the stocks of energy companies followed
suit. By year end, the fortunes of the best and worst sectors of the stock
market were gapping by more than 50%, the kind of return differential last seen
during the tech stock boom and bust in 1999 and 2000.

In the last few months of 2007 the Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") took
several steps to address the crisis, including three interest rate cuts. While
lower interest rates are historically positive for stocks, there was
considerable overhang from other economic indicators, particularly on the
inflation front, as prices of energy and food marched higher. As news, both
positive and negative, flooded the market on an almost daily basis, we saw high
volatility as investors struggled to digest the news and attempt to understand
where the economy was headed.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM GIVEN THE MARKETPLACE CONDITIONS DURING 2007?
All Fund returns cited - whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price - assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the 12-month period
ending December 31, 2007, the Fund had a return of -16.85% on a market price
basis. On a NAV basis, the return was -3.81%. By comparison, the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index ("S&P 500"), which is generally regarded as a good indicator of
the broad stock market, returned 5.49%, and the CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index
("BXM") returned 6.55%. The BXM is an index that simulates an ongoing covered
call strategy on the S&P 500 and consists of an unmanaged portfolio of stocks
upon which a one-month at-the-money call option on the S&P 500 is continuously
written.

The market price return relative to NAV return reflects a market price as of
December 31, 2007, that was significantly below NAV. The Fund's shares closed
December at $11.41, representing a 12.37% discount

to its NAV of $13.02. The Fund's NAV decreased $1.82 in 2007 from $14.84 as of
December 31, 2006, as several of the stocks in the Fund's portfolio experienced
declines in value in 2007.

As most investors may know, the market value of the Fund's shares fluctuates
from time to time, and it may be higher or lower than the Fund's NAV. The
current discount to NAV may provide an opportunity for suitable investors to
purchase shares of the Fund below the market value of the securities in the
underlying portfolios and at more attractive yield levels than would be
available if the shares were trading at or above NAV. We believe that, over the
long term, the growth of NAV will be reflected in the market price return earned
by shareholders.

Since its inception on July 28, 2004, the Fund's NAV has decreased $1.31 per
share, and the Fund has paid a total of $4.26 per share in quarterly dividends,
resulting in a 21.57% cumulative total return on an NAV basis, compared with a
33.7% increase for the BXM over the same period. We believe the Fund has lagged
the BXM for two primary reasons. First, the Fund invests mainly in high quality
stocks, which have been out of favor since the inception of the Fund. However,
should investors become more risk adverse, we feel high quality stocks and this
Fund will outperform. Secondly, a bifurcated market such as the one we had in
2007 negatively impacted the Fund's results. The Fund had its fair share of
winners in 2007, including Transocean, Inc., Apache Corp., Genzyme Corp., Biogen
Idec, Inc. and Google, Inc. (None of these stocks were held in the portfolio at
period end.) However, because these stocks moved up so dramatically, they were
called away under the Fund's covered call program; the Fund therefore did not
fully participate in the upside. At the same time, a number of stocks in the
Fund's portfolio posted significant declines; these include Capital One
Financial Corp., Countrywide Financial Corp., Citigroup, Inc., MGIC Investment
Corp., Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe's Cos., Inc (3.2%, 0.6%, 2.5%, 1.0%, 1.6%, and
2.0% of long-term investments, respectively). While writing options on these
stocks generated premiums that offset some of their declines, it wasn't enough
to avoid overall losses on these positions. While we have sold or trimmed a few
positions, in general we feel many of 2007's `losers' are trading at multi-year
lows on a number of valuation metrics and offer the Fund's investors significant
value. Therefore, the Fund continues to hold many of these positions and
continues to write options against them.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE DESCRIBE THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO EQUITY AND OPTION STRUCTURE.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund held 44 common stocks. Covered call options
were written against approximately 73% of net assets on December 31, 2007.
During the year, the Fund wrote call options that generated premiums of $34.6
million. It is the strategy of the Fund to write "out-of-the-money" options,
meaning that the strike price is higher than the current price of the underlying
stock, so that the Fund has the potential to participate in some stock price
appreciation. At the end of 2007, the majority of the Fund's options (58 of 76
different options, or 76%) were still "out-of-the-money." With this positioning,
we believe the Fund is well positioned to participate to the upside should its
stock holdings rally.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHICH INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE PREVALENT IN THE FUND?

The Fund's largest exposure was in the health care sector, followed by the
consumer discretionary, technology and financials sectors. The Fund continues to
remain absent from the materials and utilities sectors.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WILL YOU DESCRIBE THE FUND'S DIVIDEND POLICY?

The Fund paid quarterly dividends of $0.33 per share in February, May, August,
and November of 2007. Based on the Fund's market price of $11.41 per share on
December 31, 2007, and at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.33, the
annualized distribution rate was 11.6%. All dividends during 2007 represent a
combination of earned net income and short-term and long-term capital gains. The
2007 distribution did not include any return of capital. It is management's
intention to continue to pay dividends consisting of only earned net income and
capital gains.

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund | QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE DISCUSS THE FUND'S SECURITY AND OPTION SELECTION PROCESS.

The Fund is managed by two teams of investment professionals. We like to think
of these teams as a "right hand" and "left hand" meaning they work together to
make common stock and option decisions. We use fundamental analysis to select
what we believe to be solid companies with good growth prospects and attractive
valuations. We then seek what we believe to be attractive call options to write
against those stocks. It is our belief that this partnership of active
management between the equity and option teams provides investors with an
innovative, risk-moderated approach to equity investing.

MAM seeks to invest in a portfolio of common stocks that have favorable "PEG"
ratios (Price-Earnings ratio to Growth rate) as well as financial strength and
industry leadership. As bottom-up investors, we focus on the fundamental
businesses of the companies. Our stock selection philosophy strays away from the
"beat the street" objective, as we seek companies that have sustainable
competitive advantages, predictable cash flows, solid balance sheets and
high-quality management teams. By concentrating on long-term prospects and
circumventing the "instant gratification" school of thought, we believe we bring
elements of consistency, stability and predictability to the Fund's
shareholders.

Once we have selected what we believe to be attractive and solid names for the
Fund, we employ our call writing strategy. This procedure entails selling calls
that are primarily out-of the-money, meaning that the strike price is higher
than the common stock price, so that the Fund can potentially participate in
some stock appreciation. By receiving option premiums, the Fund receives a
favorable level of cash flow and adds an element of downside protection. Call
options may be written over a number of time periods and at differing strike
prices in an effort to potentially maximize the protective value to the strategy
and spread this cash flow evenly throughout the year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK FOR THE MARKET AND THE FUND IN 2008?

As we line up the positives and negatives for 2008, we see that they are fairly
evenly balanced, with a slight tilt towards the negative. The positives that are
working for the market begin with the Fed in the midst of lowering interest
rates. As we saw through the end of 2007, the Fed cuts are no guarantee of an
immediate market rally. Although the U.S. economy is slowing, the global economy
is still robust, which should continue to support U.S. stocks, particularly the
multi-national companies. Another potential positive is the impact of a lower
dollar, which helps many U.S. companies compete globally.

On the negative side, housing continues to weigh on the economy and markets. The
availability of credit at the end of 2007 remained poor, and this may limit
growth. Probably the biggest fear we have is stagflation. This would entail
rising inflation driven by higher energy prices and raw material prices while
overall economic growth is slowing. Stagflation is not generally a good
environment for the valuation of either stocks or bonds.

Given that backdrop, we believe the Fund's holdings dovetail nicely with our
outlook, with an emphasis on stocks that we believe can produce earnings in a
difficult economy. In prior reports we have talked about risk, and how we felt
it wasn't being properly weighed in the investment equation. As that changes,
and as risk becomes more of a focus, we believe it should benefit the Fund's
higher-quality, more predictably growing companies. As a result, we feel good
regarding the prospects of the Fund's portfolio, even as we enter what will
likely be a volatile and uneven 2008. On the option writing side, the VIX Index
spiked upward at the end of 2007 from very low levels. (VIX is the ticker symbol
for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a popular measure of
the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options.) We believe that this increase
in volatility, if sustained, should enable the Fund to earn greater option
premiums than in the past.

MCN RISKS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.
The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying
securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their
net asset value.

A strategy of writing (selling) covered call options entails various risks. For
example, the correlation between the equity securities and options markets may,
at times, be imperfect and can furthermore be affected by market behavior and
unforeseen events, thus causing a given transaction to not achieve its
objectives. There may be times when the Fund will be required to purchase or
sell equity securities to meet its obligations under the options contracts on
certain options at inopportune times when it may not be beneficial to the Fund.
The Fund will forego the opportunity to profit from increases in the market
value of equity securities that it has written call options on, above the sum of
the premium and the strike price of the option. Furthermore, the Fund's downside
protection on equity securities it has written call options on would be limited
to the amount of the premium received for writing the call option and thus the
Fund would be at risk for any further price declines in the stock below that
level. Please refer to the Fund's prospectus for a more thorough discussion of
the risks associated with investments in options on equity securities.

An investment in the Fund includes, but is not limited to, risks and
considerations such as: Investment Risk, Not a Complete Investment Program,
Equity Risk, Risks Associated with Options on Securities, Limitation on Option
Writing Risk, Risks of Mid-Cap Companies, Income Risk, Foreign Securities Risk,
Industry Concentration Risk, Derivatives Risk, Illiquid Securities Risk, Fund
Distribution Risk, Market Discount Risk, Other Investment Companies, Financial
Leverage Risk, Management Risk, Risks Related to Preferred Securities, Interest
Rate Risk, Inflation Risk, Current Developments Risk and Anti-Takeover
Provisions.

Fund Distribution Risk: In order to make regular quarterly distributions on its
common shares, the Fund may have to sell a portion of its investment portfolio
at a time when independent investment judgment may not dictate such action. In
addition, the Fund's ability to make distributions more frequently than annually
from any net realized capital gains by the Fund is subject to the Fund obtaining
exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which cannot be
assured. To the extent the total quarterly distributions for a year exceed the
Fund's net investment company income and net realized capital gain for that
year, the excess will generally constitute a return of the Fund's capital to its
common shareholders. Such return of capital distributions generally are tax-free
up to the amount of a common shareholder's tax basis in the common shares
(generally, the amount paid for the common shares). In addition, such excess
distributions will decrease the Fund's total assets and may increase the
Fundexpense ratio.

Risks Associated with Options on Securities: There are several risks associated
with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant
differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an
imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to
achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options
involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived
transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or
unexpected events. As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes,
during the option's life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market
value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and
the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price
of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option has no control over
the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer of the
option. Once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect
a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the
option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund

Notes to FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | DECEMBER 31, 2007


Note 1 - ORGANIZATION

Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (formerly the
Madison/Claymore Covered Call Fund) (the "Fund") was organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on May 6, 2004. The Fund is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940.

The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation. The Fund will, under normal market conditions, pursue its primary
investment objective by allocating at least 80% of total assets to an integrated
investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests in a portfolio of equity
securities consisting primarily of high quality, large capitalization common
stocks that are, in the view of the Fund's investment manager, selling at a
reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates and writes
(sells) covered call options against a portion of the equity securities held;
pending investment in equity securities or covered call options, assets of the
Fund allocated to its integrated investment strategy will be held in cash or
cash equivalents. The Fund seeks to produce a high level of current income and
gains through premiums received from writing options and, to a lesser extent,
from dividends. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its
investment objectives. The Fund's investment objectives are considered
fundamental and may not be changed without shareholder approval.

Note 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund.

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Readily marketable portfolio securities listed on an exchange or traded in the
over-the-counter market are generally valued at their last reported sale price.
If no sales are reported, the securities are valued at the mean of the closing
bid and asked prices on such day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, then the security is valued by such method as the Fund's Board of Trustees
shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair value. Securities traded on
NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. Portfolio securities
traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price at
the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities.
Debt securities are valued at the last available bid price for such securities
or, if such prices are not available, at the mean between the last bid and asked
price. Exchange-traded options are valued at the mean of the best bid and best
asked prices across all option exchanges. Short-term debt securities having a
remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded net of applicable withholding taxes on the ex-dividend date
and interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the
lives of the respective securities using the effective interest method.

To earn greater income on otherwise uninvested cash temporarily held by the
Fund, such as income earned from stock sold or called away, stock dividends and
covered call writing premiums, the Fund may invest such cash in repurchase
agreements. Repurchase agreements are short-term investments in which the Fund
acquires ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the
security at a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

(c) OPTIONS

An option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option, in
return for a premium, the right to buy from (in the case of a call) or sell to
(in the case of a put) the writer of the option the security underlying the
option at a specified exercise or "strike" price. The writer of an option on a
security has an obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying
security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case of a call) or to pay
the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (in the case of a
put).

There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities.
As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option's
life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the
security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike
price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the
underlying security decline. The writer of an option has no control over the
time when it may be required to fill its obligation as writer of the option.
Once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a
closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the
option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.

<PAGE>

(d) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund declares and pays quarterly dividends to common shareholders.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
and timing of distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These dividends consist of investment company taxable income, which
generally includes qualified dividend income, ordinary income and short-term
capital gains, including premiums received on written options. Realized
short-term capital gains are considered ordinary income for tax purposes and
will be reclassified at the Fund's fiscal year end on the Fund's Statement of
Assets and Liabilities from accumulated net realized gains to distributions in
excess of net investment income. Any net realized long-term capital gains are
distributed annually to common shareholders.

Note 3 - INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES:

Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") between the Fund
and Claymore Advisors, LLC (the "Adviser"), the Adviser will furnish offices,
necessary facilities and equipment, provide certain administrative services,
oversee the activities of Madison Asset Management LLC (the "Investment
Manager"), provide personnel, including certain officers required for the Fund's
administrative management and compensate all officers and trustees of the Fund
who are its affiliates. As compensation for these services, the Fund will pay
the Investment Adviser a fee, payable monthly, in an annual amount equal to
0.50% of the Fund's average daily managed assets. Managed assets equal the net
assets of the Fund plus any assets attributable to financial leverage.

Pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and the
Investment Manager, the Investment Manager, under the supervision of the Fund's
Board of Trustees and the Adviser, will provide a continuous investment program
for the Fund's portfolio; provide investment research and make and execute
recommendations for the purchase and sale of securities; and provide certain
facilities and personnel, including officers required for the Fund's
administrative management and compensation of all officers and trustees of the
Fund who are its affiliates. As compensation for these services, the Fund will
pay the Investment Manager a fee, payable monthly, in an annual amount equal to
0.50% of the Fund's average daily managed assets.

Under separate Fund Administration and Fund Accounting agreements, the Adviser
provides fund administration services and the Investment Manager provides fund
accounting services to the Fund. The Adviser receives a fund administration fee
payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a percentage of the
average daily managed assets of the Fund:

MANAGED ASSETS                             RATE
- -----------------------------------------------
First $200,000,000                      0.0275%
Next $300,000,000                       0.0175%
Next $500,000,000                       0.0125%
Over $1,000,000,000                     0.0100%

The Investment Manager receives a fund accounting fee based on the combined
managed assets of the Fund and the Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund, a
closed-end investment company sponsored by the Investment Manager. The fund
accounting fee is allocated on a prorated basis of the managed assets of each
fund. This fee is payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a
percentage of the average daily managed assets of the two funds:

MANAGED ASSETS                             RATE
- -----------------------------------------------
First $200,000,000                      0.0275%
Next $300,000,000                       0.0200%
Next $500,000,000                       0.0150%
Over $1,000,000,000                     0.0100%

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Claymore Advisors, LLC or Madison Asset Management LLC. The Fund does not
compensate its officers or trustees who are officers of the two aforementioned
firms.

Note 4 - FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.
Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes is required. In
addition, by distributing substantially all of its ordinary income and long-term
capital gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be
subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and realized
gains/losses under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and federal
income tax purposes, permanent differences between book and tax basis reporting
have been identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities. A permanent book and tax difference relating to a distribution
reclass in the amount of $22,044,831 was reclassified from accumulated
undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized gain. Net
realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax reporting
primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

Information on the components of investments, excluding written options, and net
assets as of December 31, 2007 is as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the tax character of
distributions paid to common shareholders as reflected in the statement of
changes in net assets was as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------


On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of
FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and is to
be applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. Management has
evaluated the implications of FIN 48 and has determined it does not have any
impact on the Fund's financial statements as of December 31, 2007.

Tax years ended 2004, 2005 and 2006 remain subject to examination by major
jurisdictions.

Note 5 - INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND OPTIONS WRITTEN:

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of investments, excluding written options and short-term investments were
$258,611,242 and $259,526,286, respectively.

Transactions in option contracts during the year ended December 31, 2007 were as
follows:

The Fund has an unlimited amount of common shares, $0.01 par value authorized

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 7 - INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is dependent upon claims that may be made against the Fund in the future, and,
therefore cannot be estimated; however, the risk of material loss from such
claims is considered remote.

Note 8 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September, 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, "Fair Valuation Measurements" ("FAS 157"). This standard clarifies the
definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair
value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. As of December 31, 2007, the Funds do not believe the adoption of
FAS 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements, however,
additional disclosure will be required about the inputs used to develop
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain of the measurements
reported in the statement of operations for a fiscal period.

Note 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

On February 1, 2008, the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.33 per common share. This dividend is payable February 29, 2008 to
shareholders of record on February 15, 2008.

Report of INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
MADISON/CLAYMORE COVERED CALL & EQUITY STRATEGY FUND

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (formerly the
Madison/Claymore Covered Call Fund) (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
three years in the period then ended and for the period from July 28, 2004
(commencement of investment operations) through December 31, 2004. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial
highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31,
2007, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate
auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund at December 31, 2007, and
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended and for the
period from July 28, 2004 (commencement of investment operations) through
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Dividend Reinvestment PLAN | (unaudited)


Unless the registered owner of common shares elects to receive cash by
contacting the Plan Administrator, all dividends declared on common shares of
the Fund will be automatically reinvested by the Bank of New York (the "Plan
Administrator"), Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), in additional common shares of the Fund.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received and processed by the
Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date; otherwise such termination
or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may automatically elect to receive
cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash in additional common shares of
the Fund for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on your common shares
of the Fund to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please contact
your broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each common shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such common shareholder's common shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common
shares. The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common
shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commission per common share is equal to or
greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan Administrator will
invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per common share on the payment date; provided
that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per common share on the payment date. If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per common share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commission, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in common shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.

If, before the Plan Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the
market price per common share exceeds the net asset value per common share, the
average per common share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of
fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued Common
Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan
Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market
Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease
making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the
Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at net asset value per common
share at the close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that, if the
net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price
per common share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of
the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares purchased
or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under
the Plan in accordance with the instruction of the participants.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued directly
by the Fund. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commission incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases. The automatic
reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any Federal, state or
local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such
Dividends.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants.

All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Administrator, The Bank of New York, Attention: Stock Transfer Department,
101 Barclay 11W, New York, New York 10286, Phone Number: (866) 488-3559.

About the FUND MANAGERl


MADISON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC

Madison Asset Management, LLC, (MAM) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison
Investment Advisors, Inc., with its affiliates, manages more than $9 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment and mutual fund assets.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

MAM believes in investing in high-quality growth companies, which deliver
potentially consistent and sustainable earnings growth, yet sell at attractive
valuations. Historically, shareholders of these types of companies have been
rewarded over the long term with above-average returns, and favorable risk
characteristics. Constructing portfolios with positive risk/reward profiles has
historically allowed clients to participate during strong market environments,
while mitigating potential declines.

INVESTMENT PROCESS

The managers employ a fundamental, bottom-up strategy in constructing equity
portfolios. The managers look for companies that they believe are consistently
growing at an above-average pace, yet sell at below-average multiple.

The managers follow a rigorous three-step process when evaluating companies and
then employ an actively-managed option strategy to help enhance income and
mitigate downside risk.

1. BUSINESS MODEL. The managers look for a sustainable competitive advantage,
   cash flow that is both predictable and growing, as well as a rock-solid
   balance sheet.

2. MANAGEMENT. When assessing management, the managers look to see how the
   company has allocated capital in the past, their track record for enhancing
   shareholder value and the nature of their accounting practices.

3. PROPER VALUATION. The final step in the process is assessing the proper
   valuation for the company. The managers strive to purchase securities trading
   at a discount to their intrinsic value as determined by discounted cash
   flows. They corroborate this valuation work with additional valuation
   methodologies.

The covered call investment strategy focuses on stocks in which the managers
have high confidence in their continuing earnings growth rates, but sell at
reasonable Price-Earnings Ratios. By writing the majority of the Fund's calls
out-of-the-money, meaning the strike price is higher than the stock price, the
Fund can participate in some stock appreciation while still receiving income in
the form of option premiums. The covered call strategy also tends to reduce the
risk compared to just owning the stock.

committee financial expert serving on its audit committee (the "Audit
Committee"), Ronald E. Toupin, Jr. Mr. Toupin is an "independent" Trustee for
purposes of this Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Mr. Toupin qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert by virtue of his experience obtained as a portfolio
manager and research analyst, which included review and analysis of offering
documents and audited and unaudited financial statements using GAAP to show
accounting estimates, accruals and reserves.

(Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit
committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, as a result of being designated or identified as an
audit committee financial expert. The designation or identification of a person
as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on such person any
duties, obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties,
obligations, and liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the Audit
Committee and Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation or
identification. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not affect the duties, obligations or liability
of any other member of the Audit Committee or Board of Trustees.)

                      are aligned with those of

                      client goals to outperform over
                      the long-term, rather than
                      focused on short-term
                      performance contests.

                                 CODE OF ETHICS
                                       FOR
                  CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


         Each of the registered investment companies listed in Appendix A hereto
(each a "Trust") is committed to conducting business in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business
ethics, and to full and accurate financial disclosure in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to the Trust's Chief Legal and
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing
similar functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth specific policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

         As a Senior Officer, you must comply with applicable law. You also have
a responsibility to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner; and you
have leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high ethical
standards and commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment that
encourages employees to raise concerns, and promptly addressing employee
compliance concerns.

         The Code of Ethics of the Trust pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "1940 Act Code
of Ethics"), which this Code of Ethics is intended to supplement, sets forth the
fundamental principles and key policies and procedures that govern the conduct
of all of us in our business as registered investment companies. You are also
bound by the requirements and standards set forth in this Code of Ethics and
other applicable laws and regulations and other policies and procedures adopted
by the Trust from time to time.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

         You are required to comply with the laws, rules and regulations that
govern the conduct of our business and to report any suspected violations in
accordance with the section below entitled "Compliance with Code of Ethics."

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         Senior Officers are expected to dedicate their best efforts to
advancing the Trust's interests and to use objective and unbiased standards when
making decisions that affect the Trust, keeping in mind that you are subject to
inherent conflicts of interest because you are an officer of Claymore Advisors,
LLC (the "Adviser") as well as the Trust. Your obligation to conduct the Trust's
business in an honest and ethical manner includes the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. A
conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics occurs when your
private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the
interests of the Trust. The 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Advisers' and the
Trust's allocation procedures and the other policies of the Trust are designed
to ensure the ethical handling of such conflicts. As a result, it is incumbent
on you to be familiar with the 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Adviser's and
Trust's allocations procedures and other rules and regulations under the 1940
Act as well as the policies of the Trust. When making any investment, accepting
any position or benefits, participating in any transaction or business
arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates or appears to create a
conflict of interest where you are


<PAGE>

receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the letter and
the spirit of the 1940 Act Code of Ethics and/or the Trust's or the Advisor's
other applicable policies and procedures. If you are in doubt as to the
application or interpretation of any of these, you should make full disclosure
of all facts and circumstances to, and obtain the prior written approval of the
Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent
Trustee of the Trust.(1).

DISCLOSURES

         It is the policy of the Trust to make full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
in all reports and documents that the Trust files with, or submits to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in all other public communications made
by the Trust. As a Senior Officer, you are required to promote compliance with
this policy by all employees and to abide by the Trust's standards, policies and
procedures designed to promote compliance with this policy.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

         If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics or other
laws, regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you must
immediately report that information to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of
the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent Trustee of the Trust. No one will
be subject to retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected
violation.

         The Trust will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

         o        the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust will take all
                  appropriate action to investigate any actual or potential
                  violations reported to him;

         o        violations and potential violations will be reported to the
                  Independent Trustees after such investigation;

         o        if the Independent Trustees determine that a violation has
                  occurred, they will take, or shall designate appropriate
                  persons to determine, appropriate action in response to
                  violations of this Code of Ethics; and

         o        appropriate action may include a letter of censure,
                  suspension, dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other
                  serious violations of law, notification of the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission or other appropriate law enforcement
                  authorities.

         Senior Officers must make this Code of Ethics known to persons who
might know of potential conflicts of interest, including any "whistle blower"
policies that the Trust may adopt from time to time.

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

         Except as otherwise provided in this Code of Ethics, the Chairman of
the Audit Committee of the Trust is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics
to specific situations in which questions are presented to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust and has the authority to


- -------------------
(1) An "Independent Trustee" is any Trustee who is not an "interested person" of
    the Trust within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

<PAGE>

interpret this Code of Ethics in any particular situation. The Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust shall take action he or she considers appropriate
to investigate any actual or potential violations reported under this Code of
Ethics.

         The Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust is authorized to
consult, as appropriate, with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
Trust, the Independent Trustees or the Board of Trustees and with counsel to the
Trust, Claymore or the Independent Trustees, and is encouraged to do so.

         The Independent Trustees are responsible for granting waivers of this
Code of Ethics, as appropriate. Any changes to or waivers of this Code of Ethics
will, to the extent required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by
Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

         This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Trust's Senior Officers in the conduct
of the Trust's business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in
any employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES
<TEXT>

                                                                     EXHIBIT (c)


                              PROXY VOTING POLICIES

Our policies regarding voting the proxies of securities held in client accounts
depend on the nature of our relationship to the client. When we are an ERISA
fiduciary of an account, there are additional considerations and procedures than
for all other (regular) accounts. In all cases, when we vote client proxies, we
must do so in the client's best interests as described below by these policies.

REGULAR ACCOUNTS
We do not assume the role of an active shareholder when managing client
accounts. If we are dissatisfied with the performance of a particular company,
we will generally reduce or terminate our position in the company rather than
attempt to force management changes through shareholder activism.

MAKING THE INITIAL DECISION ON HOW TO VOTE THE PROXY
As stated above, our goal and intent is to vote all proxies in the client's best
interests. For practical purposes, unless we make an affirmative decision to the
contrary, when we vote a proxy as the Board of Directors of a company
recommends, it means we agree with the Board that voting in such manner is in
the interests of our clients as shareholders of the company for the reasons
stated by the Board. However, if we believe that voting as the Board of
Directors recommends would not be in a client's best interests, then we must
vote against the Board's recommendation.

As a matter of standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted
(by telephone or Internet or through a proxy voting service), unless we are not
authorized to vote proxies. When the client has reserved the right to vote
proxies in his/her/its account, we must make arrangements for proxies to be
delivered directly to such client from its custodian and, to the extent any such
proxies are received by us inadvertently, promptly forward them to the client.

DOCUMENTING OUR DECISIONS
In cases where a proxy will NOT be voted or, as described below, voted against
the Board of Directors recommendation, our policy is to make a notation to the
file containing the records for such security (e.g., Corporation X research
file, since we may receive numerous proxies for the same company and it is
impractical to keep such records in the file of each individual client)
explaining our action or inaction, as the case may be. Alternatively, or in
addition to such notation, we may include a copy of the rationale for such
decision in the appropriate equity correspondence file.

WHY WOULD VOTING AS THE BOARD RECOMMENDS NOT BE IN THE CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS?
Portfolio management must, at a minimum, consider the following questions before
voting any proxy:

1. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could dilute or
otherwise diminish the value of our position? (This question is more complex
than it looks: We must consider the time frames involved for both the client and
the issuer. For example, if the Board of Directors is recommending an action
that might initially cause the position to lose value but will increase the
value of the position in the long-term, we would vote as the Board recommended
for if we are holding the security for clients as a long-term investment.
However, if the investment is close to our valuation limits and we are
anticipating eliminating the position in the short-term, then it would be in our
clients' best interests to vote against management's recommendation.)

<PAGE>

2. If so, would we be unable to liquidate the affected securities without
incurring a loss that would not otherwise have been recognized absent
management's proposal?

3. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could cause the
securities held to lose value, rights or privileges and there are no comparable
replacement investments readily available on the market? (For example, a company
can be uniquely positioned in the market because of its valuation compared with
otherwise comparable securities such that it would not be readily replaceable if
we were to liquidate the position. In such a situation, we might vote against
management's recommendation if we believe a "No" vote could help prevent future
share price depreciation resulting from management's proposal or if we believe
the value of the investment will appreciate if management's proposal fails. A
typical recent example of this type of decision is the case of a Board
recommendation not to expense stock options, where we would vote against
management's recommendation because we believe expensing such options will do
more to enhance shareholder value going forward.)

4. Would accepting the Board of Directors recommendation cause us to violate our
client's investment guidelines? (For example, a Board may recommend merging the
company into one that is not permitted by client investment guidelines, e.g. a
tobacco product company, a foreign security that is not traded on any US
exchange or in US dollars, etc., restrictions often found in client investment
guidelines. This would be an unusual situation and it is possible we would,
nevertheless, vote in favor of a Board's recommendation in anticipation of
selling the investment prior to the date any vote would effectively change the
nature of the investment as described. Moreover, this does not mean we will
consider any client-provided proxy voting guidelines. Our policy is that client
investment guidelines may not include proxy voting guidelines if our firm will
vote account proxies. Rather, we will only vote client proxies in accordance
with these guidelines. Clients who wish their account proxies to be voted in
accordance with their own proxy voting guidelines must retain proxy voting
authority for themselves.)

Essentially, we must "second guess" the Board of Directors to determine if their
recommendation is in the best interests of our clients, regardless of whether
the Board thinks their recommendation is in the best interests of shareholders
in general. The above questions should apply no matter the type of action
subject to the proxy. For example, changes in corporate governance structures,
adoption or amendments to compensation plans (including stock options) and
matters involving social issues or corporate responsibility should all be
reviewed in the context of how it will affect our clients' investment.

In making our decisions, to the extent we rely on any analysis outside of the
information contained in the proxy statements, we must retain a record of such
information in the same manner as other books and records (2 years in the
office, 5 years in an easily accessible place). Also, if a proxy statement is
NOT available on the SEC's EDGAR database, we must keep a copy of the proxy
statement.

ADDRESSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Although it is not likely, in the event there is a conflict of interest between
us and our client in connection with a material proxy vote (for example, (1) the
issuer or an affiliate of the issuer is also a client or is actively being
sought as a client or (2) we have a significant business relationship with the
issuer such that voting in a particular manner could jeopardize this client
and/or business relationship), our policy is to alert affected client(s) of the
conflict before voting and indicate the manner in which we will vote. In such
circumstances, our client(s) may instruct us to vote in a different manner. In
any case, we must obtain client consent to vote the proxy when faced with a
conflict of interest. If the conflict involves a security held by a mutual fund
we manage, then we must present the material conflict to the Board of the
applicable fund for consent or direction to

<PAGE>

vote the proxies. If the conflict involves a security held by wrap accounts,
then we may present the conflict to the wrap sponsor, as our agent, to obtain
wrap client consent or direction to vote the proxies. Note that no conflict
generally exists for routine proxy matters such as approval of the independent
auditor (unless, of course, the auditor in question is a client, we are seeking
the auditor as a client or we have a significant business relationship with the
auditor), electing an uncontested Board of Directors, etc.

In the event it is impractical to obtain client consent to vote a proxy when
faced with a conflict of interest, or at the request of the applicable fund
Board, the firm will employ the services of an independent third party "proxy
services firm" to make the proxy voting decision in accordance with Rule
206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The firm has
retained the firm of Glass Lewis & Co. to serve in this capacity. All investment
company Boards for which we provide investment management services have
requested we utilize the recommendations of Glass Lewis & Co. in cases of
conflicts of interest.

Once any member of the relevant portfolio management team determines that it
would be in our clients' best interests to vote AGAINST management
recommendations (or, for Madison Scottsdale and Concord Asset Management, any
particular portfolio manager makes such determination), then the decision should
be brought to the attention of the Investment Committee, or any subcommittee
appointed by the Investment Committee from among its members (such subcommittee
may be a single person), to ratify the decision to stray from our general policy
of voting with management. Such ratification need not be in writing.

The Investment Committee or any subcommittee appointed by the Investment
Committee from among its members (such subcommittee may be a single person)
shall monitor potential conflicts of interest between our firm and clients that
would affect the manner by which we vote a proxy. We maintain a "conflicted
list" for proxy voting purposes.

As of January 1, 2004, Jay Sekelsky represents the Investment Committee
subcommittee described above.

ERISA FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS
As a general rule, an ERISA plan Trustee is required to vote proxies. However,
the fiduciary act of managing plan assets includes the responsibility to vote
proxies on plan-owned stock when the named fiduciary has delegated management
responsibility to an investment manager. Therefore, unless another named
fiduciary (Trustee, another investment manager, consultant, plan administrator,
employer, etc.) for any ERISA client expressly reserves the right to vote
proxies, we are required to do so. In most cases, the plan document will specify
who is required to vote proxies.

It is important that our investment management agreement (or the ERISA client's
plan document) (collectively, the "Contracts") address the issue of who is
responsible for voting proxies.

1. If the Contracts expressly preclude us from voting proxies, then the Trustee
must vote proxies attributable to our ERISA client's accounts.

2. On the other hand, if the Contracts are silent or simply state that we "may"
vote proxies, then it is our fiduciary duty to affirmatively vote under ERISA.

ERISA requires us, when we are responsible for voting proxies:

1. To maintain voting records for review by the named fiduciary of the plan; and

2. Ensure that the custodian (or plan Trustee, as the case may be) forward to us
all proxies received so that we may vote them in a timely manner.

<PAGE>

Our general policy is to vote all ERISA plan proxies received in the same manner
as we vote non-ERISA plan proxies described above. Again, as a matter of
standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted (by telephone
or Internet).

ADDITIONAL RECORDKEEPING RULES RELATED TO PROXY VOTING
We must keep any written documents (including email) we prepared that were
material to making a decision on how to vote a proxy (or that memorialized the
basis for our decision). As noted above, we need not keep a copy of the actual
proxy statements we received if they are available on the SEC's EDGAR database.

We must keep in the applicable client file records of written client requests
for proxy voting information. We must, of course, also keep a copy in the client
file of any of our written responses to clients who asked for such information
either in writing or orally.

We retained the services of ProxyEdge to maintain the records of the proxy votes
we cast on behalf of clients. To the extent we vote any proxies outside of this
service (for example, for logistical purposes, certain Madison Scottsdale
proxies may not be maintained by this service), then copies of the voted proxy
must be maintained in the applicable client or research file, as the case may
be. Unless an investment company invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
it shall file Form N-PX annually with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission no later than August 31 for the period covering the previous July 1
through June 30.
