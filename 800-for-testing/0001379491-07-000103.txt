Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for
AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund (the "Fund") for the annual reporting
period ended March 31, 2007. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under
the New York Stock Exchange symbol "AWF." Effective January 26, 2007, the Fund
changed its name from Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. to
AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund, Inc. to reflect the new investment
policies and guidelines, which are discussed below, and to brand the Fund with
the same AllianceBernstein name used for most other funds in the
AllianceBernstein family of funds. On April 13, 2007, the Fund acquired all of
the assets and assumed the liabilities of Alliance World Dollar Government
Fund, Inc. in exchange for shares of the Fund.

Investment Objective and Policies

This closed-end fund seeks high current income and secondarily, capital
appreciation. At a Special Meeting of the Fund's stockholders held on December
12, 2006, stockholders approved a proposal to eliminate the fundamental
investment restriction requiring that the Fund invest at least 65% of its total
assets in sovereign debt obligations issued or guaranteed by foreign
governments. The Fund is now permitted to invest, without limit, in securities
denominated in non-U.S. currencies as well as those denominated in the U.S.
dollar. The Fund may also invest, without limit, in sovereign debt securities
issued by emerging and developed nations and in debt securities of U.S. and
non-U.S. corporate issuers. For more information regarding the Fund's risks,
please see "A Word About Risk" on page 4 and "Note E--Risks Involved in
Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to Financial Statements on page 33.

Investment Results

The table on page 5 shows the Fund's performance compared to its new benchmark,
the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (JPM EMBI Global) and its
old benchmark, the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+).
The JPM EMBI Global tracks total returns for U.S. dollar-denominated debt
instruments issued by emerging market sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities,
Brady bonds, loans and eurobonds. The JPM EMBI Global is a more appropriate
index for the Fund because it contains a broader representation of the emerging
market debt universe than the JPM EMBI+.

The Fund outperformed both the old and new benchmarks for both the six- and
12-month periods ended March 31, 2007. Contributing positively to performance
for both periods was the Fund's exposure to unhedged local currency emerging
market debt, which outperformed the benchmark.

Significantly adding to the Fund's return was the Fund's exposure to local debt
in Brazil, and to a lesser extent Mexico. The Fund's U.S. dollar debt in Peru,
Panama and Indonesia also contributed positively to performance. The Fund's
leveraged position, at a time when emerging market debt countries posted solid
returns, continued to add to relative performance. Both the old and new
benchmarks are unleveraged.


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 1


Detracting from Fund performance for both the six- and 12-month periods was
security selection in Argentina. Although the Fund's country selection of
Argentina contributed positively to performance, shorter maturity bond
selection in the country detracted from performance as Argentina's
longer-duration bonds outperformed.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

The emerging market debt class, as represented by the JPM EMBI Global, posted a
strong return of 10.86% for the annual period ended March 31, 2007,
outperforming most fixed-income sectors. Emerging market debt began the period
in negative territory, dragged down by rising global interest rates as well as
successive interest-rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed").
Emerging market debt bounced back strongly in the second half of 2006, sparked
by the first U.S. monetary-policy shift in more than two years. The Fed left
the Fed funds rate unchanged at 5.25% in August 2006, and ended their
tightening policy following 425 basis points of consecutive rate hikes.
Additionally, solid global growth, strong investor demand and ample
financial-market liquidity all led to a favorable environment for emerging
market debt.

A temporary spike in volatility, however, returned to the bond market at the
end of February 2007, as global equity markets sold off sharply, led by
declines in China, then Europe and the U.S. China's sell-off was prompted by
its government's proposals to control the market, curbing speculative activity.
Emerging market debt impressed with a quicker recovery than most fixed-income
sectors and ended the period with the yield spread returning to near-record low
levels of 170 basis points over comparable Treasuries.

For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2007, all countries within the Fund's
benchmark posted positive returns, with the exception of Ecuador. Latin
countries at 12.37% outpaced non-Latin regions at 9.02%. Outperforming
countries for the annual period included Argentina at 33.08%, Peru at 16.08%
and Brazil at 15.50%. Underperforming countries for the year included Ecuador
at -0.86% and Lebanon at 3.73%, both of which suffered from political events.

Emerging market debt in local currency terms (unhedged in U.S. dollars) posted
even stronger returns for the period at 12.45%, due to strong local currencies
and falling interest rates. Brazil, the Fund's largest local currency holding,
significantly outperformed, posting a strong return of 26.43%.

Emerging market debt countries favored during the period included Brazil,
Argentina, Peru and Panama, as well as corporate debt in Russia. Like most
Latin American countries, Brazil benefited from a cycle of robust net exports,
capital inflows and prudent fiscal and monetary policy. Brazil has shown
impressive progress in building dollar reserves and has made great strides in
decreasing its external and sovereign debt ratios (the country's outstanding
sovereign debt versus its gross domestic product or GDP), two of the most
critical factors for advancing to investment grade.


2 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


Peru has benefited from strong economic growth, fiscal and current account
surpluses and modest inflation. Peru has also impressed with progress in
building dollar reserves and decreasing its external and sovereign debt ratios
(the country's outstanding sovereign debt versus its GDP). Standard & Poor's
and Fitch Ratings Inc. recently upgraded the country to BB+, one notch below
investment grade, and Moody's Investors Service has placed it on positive
outlook.

Panama benefited from a strengthening economy and canal-related fees, services
and expansion. Panama also continued to be strongly levered to regional and
global growth. During much of the annual period, Russia was favored as it
continued to increase its already high level of U.S. dollar reserves while
paying back debt; it is also likely to join the World Trade Organization by
mid-2007. Also, the Fund's holdings in Ecuador were eliminated due to political
risk.

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE

An Important Note About the Value of Historical Performance

The performance shown on the following page represents past performance and
does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher
than the performance information shown. All fees and expenses related to the
operation of the Fund have been deducted. Performance assumes reinvestment of
distributions and does not account for taxes.


AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund Shareholder Information

The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "AWF." Weekly comparative and market price
information about the Fund is published each Monday in The Wall Street Journal,
each Sunday in The New York Times, each Saturday in Barron's and other
newspapers in a table called "Closed-End Funds." For additional shareholder
information regarding this Fund, please see page 52.


Benchmark Disclosure

Neither the unmanaged J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (JPM EMBI
Global) nor the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+)
reflects fees and expenses associated with the active management of a mutual
fund portfolio. The JPM EMBI Global tracks total returns for U.S.
dollar-denominated debt instruments issued by emerging market sovereign and
quasi-sovereign entities, Brady bonds, loans and eurobonds. The JPM EMBI+ is a
standard measure of the performance of a basket of unmanaged emerging market
debt securities. An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and its
results are not indicative of the performance of any specific investment,
including the Fund.


A Word About Risk

The Fund invests primarily in foreign securities which may result in
significant fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the
possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainty
in foreign countries. The Fund may invest in securities of emerging market
nations, which may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal,
political and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of
investing in developed foreign countries. Fluctuations in the exchange rates
between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value
of the Fund's investments or reduce the returns of the Fund. Price fluctuation
in the Fund's portfolio securities may be caused by changes in the general
level of interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Please note,
as interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall and can cause the value of an
investment in the Fund to decline. Changes in interest rates have a greater
effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with shorter maturities.
At the discretion of the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest substantially all
of its net assets in bonds that are rated below investment grade (i.e., "junk
bonds") and up to 50% in securities that are not readily marketable. These
high-yield bonds involve a greater risk of default and price volatility than
other bonds. Investing in non-investment grade securities presents special
risks, including credit risk. Investments in the Fund are not guaranteed
because of fluctuation in the net asset value of the underlying fixed-income
related investments. Similar to direct bond ownership, bond funds have the same
interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the
underlying bonds owned by the Fund. The Fund utilizes leverage, which increases
volatility since leverage magnifies both positive and negative performance. The
Fund maintains asset coverage of at least 300%. While the Fund invests
principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in order to achieve its
investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain types of investment
derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. These instruments
involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks
presented by more traditional investments.

Notes to Financial Statements


NOTE A

Significant Accounting Policies

AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), formerly Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on May 20, 1993 and is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make
certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange (other than securities listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market,
Inc. ("NASDAQ")) or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities listed only on NASDAQ are valued in
accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call options
are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that day, such
securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open futures
contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement price or,
in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are
no quotations available for the day of valuation, the last available closing
settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter market,
("OTC") are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices as reported
by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable sources; U.S. Government
securities and other debt instruments having 60 days or less remaining until
maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or
less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if
their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities,
including mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued on the
basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one
or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 27


quotes are obtained, AllianceBernstein L.P. (the "Adviser") may establish
procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a
daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other
derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a
major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and commitments under
forward currency exchange contracts are translated into U.S. dollars at the
mean of the quoted bid and asked prices of such currencies against the U.S.
dollar. Purchases and sales of portfolio securities are translated into U.S.
dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing when such securities were acquired
or sold. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
exchange prevailing when accrued.

Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency transactions represents foreign
exchange gains and losses from sales and maturities of foreign fixed income
investments, foreign currency exchange contracts, holding of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on foreign investment transactions, and the difference between the
amounts of dividends, interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the
Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts actually received or paid.
Net unrealized currency gains and losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected
as a component of net unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments
and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.

3. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required. The Fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which it
invests. Such taxes are generally based on income and/or capital gains earned
or repatriated. Taxes


28 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

are accrued and applied to net investment income, net realized gains and net
unrealized appreciation/depreciation as such income and/or gains are earned.

4. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and
accretes discounts as adjustments to interest income.

5. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent these differences
are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based
on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not require such
reclassification.

NOTE B

Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .90% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets. Prior to October 1, 2005, the Fund paid the Adviser an advisory fee at
an annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund's average weekly net assets. Such fee is
accrued daily and paid monthly.

Pursuant to the Administration Agreement in effect until October 1, 2005, the
Fund paid the Adviser an administrative fee of .15% of the Fund's average
weekly net assets. Effective that date pursuant to an Amended Administration
Agreement, the Fund reimburses the Adviser for its costs, including legal and
accounting costs, in serving as Administrator of the Fund; provided, however,
that the reimbursement may not exceed the prior fee of .15% of average weekly
net assets. For the year ended March 31, 2007, the Fund paid the Adviser
$102,250 for its administrative services, representing .01% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with
AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc. ("ABIS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Adviser, the Fund reimburses ABIS for costs relating to servicing phone
inquiries on behalf of the Fund. During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Fund
reimbursed $775 to ABIS.

NOTE C

Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the year ended March 31, 2007, were as follows:

                                              Purchases             Sales
                                            ------------        -------------
Investment securities (excluding
  U.S. government securities)              $ 785,480,546      $ 660,776,895
U.S. government securities                            -0-                -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes, gross unrealized
appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap contracts and foreign
currency transactions) are as follows:

Cost                                                           $1,006,245,229
                                                               --------------
Gross unrealized appreciation                                     $89,152,578
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (2,823,703)
                                                               --------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                       $86,328,875
                                                               --------------

1. Forward Currency Exchange Contracts

The Fund may enter into forward currency exchange contracts in order to hedge
its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its foreign
portfolio holdings, to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments
denominated in foreign currencies and for investment purposes. A forward
currency exchange contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign
currency on a future date at a negotiated forward rate. The gain or loss
arising from the difference between the original contract and the closing of
such contract would be included in net realized gain or loss on foreign
currency transactions.

Fluctuations in the value of open forward currency exchange contracts are
recorded for financial reporting purposes as unrealized appreciation and
depreciation by the Fund.

The Fund's custodian will place and maintain cash not available for investment
or other liquid assets in a separate account of the Fund having a value at
least equal to the aggregate amount of  the Fund's commitments under forward
currency exchange contracts entered into with respect to position hedges.

Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to meet the
terms of a contract and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The face or contract amount, in U.S.
dollars reflects the total exposure the Fund has in that particular currency
contract.


30 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

2. Option Transactions

For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put
and call options on U.S. and foreign government securities and foreign
currencies that are traded on U.S. and foreign securities exchanges and
over-the-counter markets.

The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk
of loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not
perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired
through the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The
proceeds from securities sold through the exercise of put options are decreased
by the premiums paid.

When the Fund writes an option, the premium received by the Fund is recorded as
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of the
option written. Premiums received from written options which expire unexercised
are recorded by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains from options
written. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium received is less than the
amount paid for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call
option is exercised, the premium received is added to the proceeds from the
sale of the underlying security or currency in determining whether the Fund has
realized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium received
reduces the cost basis of the security or currency purchased by the Fund. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security or currency underlying the written option. Exercise
of an option written by the Fund could result in the Fund's selling or buying a
security or currency at a price different from the current market value.

For the year ended March 31, 2007, the Fund had no transactions in written
options.

3. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 31


a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment to be received
by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the contract.
Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a
swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may
arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the
underlying securities.

The Fund accrues for the interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis,
with the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of
swap contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities. Once the interim
payments are settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss
on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of
swap contracts on the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the value of
swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. The Fund may purchase credit
protection on the referenced obligation of the credit default swap ("Buy
Contract") or provide credit protection on the referenced obligation of the
credit default swap ("Sale Contract"). A sale/(buy) in a credit default swap
provides upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined in the swap
agreement, for the Fund to buy/(sell) from/(to) the counterparty at the
notional amount (the "Notional Amount") and receive/(deliver) the principal
amount of the referenced obligation. If a credit event occurs, the maximum
payout amount for a Sale Contract is limited to the Notional Amount of the swap
contract ("Maximum Payout Amount"). During the term of the swap agreement, the
Fund receives/(pays) fixed payments from/(to) the respective counterparty,
calculated at the agreed upon interest rate applied to the Notional Amount.
These interim payments are recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation
of swap contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities.

Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the Fund is
a buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its investment. In addition,
if the Fund is a seller and a credit event occurs, the value of the referenced
obligation received by the Fund coupled with the periodic payments previously
received, may be less than the Maximum Payout Amount it pays to the buyer,
resulting in a loss to the Fund.

At March 31, 2007, the Fund had Sale Contracts outstanding with Maximum Payout
Amounts aggregating $107,124,000, with net unrealized appreciation of
$3,984,706 and terms ranging from 1 month to 3 years, as reflected in the
portfolio of investments.

In certain circumstances, the Fund may hold Sale Contracts on the same
referenced obligation and with the same counterparty from which it has pur-


32 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

chased credit protection, which may reduce its obligation to make payments on
Sale Contracts, if a credit event occurs. The Fund had buy contracts with a
Notional Amount of $11,430,000 with respect to the same referenced obligations
and same counterparties of certain Sale Contracts outstanding which reduced its
obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts to $95,964,000 as of March 31,
2007.

4. Reverse Repurchase Agreements

Under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells securities and agrees to
repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price. At the time the Fund
enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish a segregated
account with the custodian containing liquid assets having a value at least
equal to the repurchase price.

For the year ended March 31, 2007, the average amount of reverse repurchase
agreements outstanding was $143,830,609 and the daily weighted average interest
rate was 4.27%.

NOTE D

Capital Stock

During the years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, the Fund issued no
shares in connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

NOTE E

Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Foreign Securities Risk--Investing in securities of foreign companies or
foreign governments involves special risks which include changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and the possibility of future political and economic
developments which could adversely affect the value of such securities.
Moreover, securities of many foreign companies or foreign governments and their
markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of
comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 33


Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

Leverage Risk--The Fund may use certain investment techniques that have
increased risks. For example, the Fund may use leverage, through borrowings, to
enhance its returns. For this purpose, the Fund may use reverse repurchase
agreements and dollar rolls, which are considered borrowings, as part of its
investment strategy. Borrowings allow the Fund to increase the amount of money
available to invest in debt securities. As long as the income from the
securities financed is greater than the interest cost of the borrowings, the
Fund's investors benefit from higher returns than if the Fund were not
leveraged.

The use of leverage, which is usually considered speculative, involves certain
risks to stockholders. These include a higher volatility of the NAV of the
common stock caused by favorable or adverse changes in interest rates. In
addition, fluctuations in the interest rates on a fund's borrowings will affect
the return to stockholders, with increases in interest rates decreasing the
fund's return.

To the extent that the current interest rate on a fund's borrowings approaches
the net return on the leveraged portion of the fund's investment portfolio, the
benefit of leverage to stockholders will be reduced. If the current interest
rate on the borrowings were to exceed the net return on that portion of the
fund's portfolio, the fund's leverage would result in a lower rate of return to
stockholders and in a lower NAV than if a fund were not leveraged.

NOTE F

Distributions to Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2007 and March 31, 2006 were as follows:

                                                      2007            2006
                                                 -------------    ------------
Distributions paid from:

34 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

As of March 31, 2007, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income                                    $10,348,257
Undistributed long-term capital gains                             14,268,618(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                            86,274,080(b)
                                                                 --------------
Total accumulated earnings (deficit)                            $110,890,955


(a)  During the fiscal year, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of
$17,972,214.

(b)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of
losses on wash sales, the difference between book and tax amortization methods
for premium and the difference between book  and tax treatment of swap income.

During the current fiscal year, permanent differences primarily due to the tax
treatment of swap income, tax character of paydown gain/losses and foreign
currency transactions, and the tax treatment of bond premium, resulted in a net
decrease in distributions in excess of net investment income and a decrease in
accumulated net realized gain on investment transactions. This reclassification
had no effect on net assets.

NOTE G

Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland (the "Mutual Fund MDL").
Management of the Adviser


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 35


believes that these private lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuation dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAGOrder"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

  (i)  The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the "Reimbursement
Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse effects of market
timing attributable to market timing relationships described in the SEC Order.
According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of
priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered
by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;

  (ii)  The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some of
the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January 1,
2004, for a period of at least five years; and

  (iii)  The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the
Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it did not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

On February 10, 2004, the Adviser received (i) a subpoena duces tecum from the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia and (ii) a request
for information from West Virginia's Office of the State Auditor, Securities
Commission (the "West Virginia Securities Commissioner") (together, the
"Information Requests"). Both Information Requests require the Adviser to
produce documents concerning, among other things, any market timing or late
trading in the Adviser's sponsored mutual funds. The Adviser responded to the
Information Requests and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

Notes to Financial Statements

On April 11, 2005, a complaint entitled The Attorney General of the State of
West Virginia v. AIM Advisors, Inc., et al. ("WVAG Complaint") was filed
against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. ("Alliance
Holding"), and various other defendants not affiliated with the Adviser. The
WVAG Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia
by the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia. The WVAG Complaint makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in certain of the complaints
related to the lawsuits discussed above. On October 19, 2005, the WVAG
Complaint was transferred to the Mutual Fund MDL.

On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner signed a Summary
Order to Cease and Desist, and Notice of Right to Hearing addressed to the
Adviser and Alliance Holding. The Summary Order claims that the Adviser and
Alliance Holding violated the West Virginia Uniform Securities Act, and makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in the SEC Order and the NYAG
Order. On January 26, 2006, the Adviser, Alliance Holding, and various
unaffiliated defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Order
Suspending Proceedings in West Virginia state court seeking to vacate the
Summary Order and for other relief. The court denied the writ and in September
2006 the Supreme Court of Appeals declined the defendants' petition for appeal.
On September 22, 2006, Alliance and Alliance Holding filed an answer and motion
to dismiss the Summary Order with the Securities Commissioner.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Fund was not named as a defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The
Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by alleged shareholders of an AllianceBernstein mutual
fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things, (i) that certain of the
defendants improperly authorized the payment of excessive commissions and other
fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in exchange for preferential marketing
services, (ii) that certain of the defendants misrepresented and omitted from
registration statements and other reports material facts concerning such
payments, and (iii) that certain defendants caused such conduct as control
persons of other defendants. The Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation
of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206
and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding
and abetting breaches of common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of
their contracts with the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the
Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees,
commissions and


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 37


soft dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or discriminatorily
obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, nine additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants. All nine of the lawsuits (i) were brought
as class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, (ii) assert claims substantially identical to the Aucoin
Complaint, and (iii) are brought on behalf of shareholders of the Funds.

On February 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action
complaint ("Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint") that asserts claims
substantially similar to the Aucoin Complaint and the nine additional lawsuits
referenced above. On October 19, 2005, the District Court dismissed each of the
claims set forth in the Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint, except for
plaintiffs' claim under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. On January
11, 2006, the District Court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and
dismissed the remaining Section 36(b) claim. On May 31, 2006 the District Court
denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On July 5,
2006, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On October 4, 2006 the appeal was
withdrawn by stipulation, with plaintiffs reserving the right to reinstate it
at a later date.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing a fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
would be recorded in the current period. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
tax years as of the effective date. On December 22, 2006, the Securities and
Exchange Commission notified the industry that the implementation of FIN 48 by
registered investment companies could be delayed until the last business day of
the first required financial statement reporting period for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial statements has not yet
been determined.

Notes to Financial Statements

On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 establishes an
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. The
application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is evaluating the implications of FAS 157 and its impact on the
financial statements has not yet been determined.

Subsequent Events

On April 13, 2007, the Fund acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the
liabilities of Alliance World Dollar Government Fund, Inc. ("AWG") in a tax
free event, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and Liquidation
approved by the stockholders of AWG at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held
on January 19, 2007. As a result of the acquisition, stockholders of AWG
received shares of the Fund equivalent to the aggregate net asset value of the
shares they held in AWG. Stockholders participating in AWG's dividend
reinvestment plan received full and fractional shares of the Fund. Other
stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares.

On April 12, 2007, the aggregate net assets of the Fund and AWG were
$1,001,169,926 and $128,756,589, respectively. As of the close of business on
April 13, 2007, the combined net assets of the Fund amounted to $1,129,600,816.

(a)  As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however prior to
April 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. The effect of this change for
the year ended March 31, 2004, was to decrease net investment income per share
by $0.06 and increase net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment
transactions per share by $0.06, and decrease the ratios of net investment
income and expenses to average net assets by 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively.

(b)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(c)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to
the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of
such periods. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one
year is not annualized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund, Inc., formerly Alliance World Dollar
Government Fund II, Inc., (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments,
as of March 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations and cash flows
for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of March 31, 2007 by correspondence with
the custodian and others, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from others were not received. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund at March 31, 2007, the results of its
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund

Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may elect to be
participants in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which
distributions to shareholders will be paid in or reinvested in additional
shares of the Fund. Computershare Trust Company N.A. (the "Agent") will act as
agent for participants under the Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in
the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether or how they may participate in the Plan.

If the Board declares a distribution payable either in shares or in cash, as
holders of the Common Stock may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares
of Common Stock of the Fund valued as follows:

(i) If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current market
price.

(ii) If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
value at the time of valuation, the Agent will receive the distribution in cash
and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of Common Stock in the open
market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants'
accounts. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after the payment date for
such distribution and in no event more than 30 days after such date except
where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply
with Federal securities laws. If, before the Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of a share of Common Stock, the
average purchase price per share paid by the Agent may exceed the net asset
value of the Fund's shares of Common Stock, resulting in the acquisition of
fewer shares than if the distribution had been paid in shares issued by the
Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of
the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares. In each case, the cost per share of
shares purchased for each shareholder's account will be the average cost,
including brokerage commissions, of any shares purchased in the open market
plus the cost of any shares issued by the Fund.


44 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of
any income taxes that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on
distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change sent to
participants in the Plan at least 90 days before the record date for such
distribution. The Plan may also be amended or terminated by the Agent on at
least 90 days' written notice to participants in the Plan. All correspondence
concerning the Plan should be directed to the Agent at Computershare Trust
Company N.A., P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010.

Information Regarding the Review and Approval of the Fund's Advisory and
Administration Agreements

The Fund's disinterested directors (the "directors") unanimously approved the
continuance of the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser and the
continuance of the Administration Agreement between the Adviser (in such
capacity, the "Administrator") and the Fund at a meeting held on October
31-November 2, 2006.

In preparation for the meeting, the directors had requested from the Adviser
and received and evaluated extensive materials, including performance and
expense information for other investment companies with similar investment
objectives derived from data compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), which is not
affiliated with the Adviser. Prior to voting, the directors reviewed the
proposed continuance of the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement
with management and with experienced counsel who are independent of the Adviser
and received a memorandum from such counsel discussing the legal standards for
their consideration of the proposed continuance. The directors also discussed
the proposed continuance in three private sessions at which only the directors,
their independent counsel and the Fund's Independent Compliance Officer were
present. In reaching their determinations relating to continuance of the
Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, the directors considered
all factors they believed relevant, including the following:

1.  information comparing the performance of the Fund to other investment
companies with similar investment objectives and to an index;

2.  the nature, extent and quality of investment, compliance, administrative
and other services rendered by the Adviser;

3.  payments received by the Adviser from all sources in respect of the Fund
and all investment companies in the AllianceBernstein Funds complex;

4.  the costs borne by, and profitability of, the Adviser and its affiliates in
providing services to the Fund and to all investment companies in the
AllianceBernstein Funds complex;

5.  comparative fee and expense data for the Fund and other investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

6.  the extent to which economies of scale would be realized to the extent the
Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale for the
benefit of investors;


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 53


7.  the Adviser's policies and practices regarding allocation of portfolio
transactions of the Fund;

8.  portfolio turnover rates for the Fund compared to other investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

9.  fall-out benefits which the Adviser and its affiliates receive from their
relationships with the Fund;

10.  the Adviser's representation that there are no institutional products
managed by the Adviser which have a substantially similar investment style as
the Fund;

11.  the professional experience and qualifications of the Fund's portfolio
management team and other senior personnel of the Adviser;

12.  the terms of the Advisory Agreement; and

13.  the terms of the Administration Agreement.

The directors also considered their knowledge of the nature and quality of the
services provided by the Adviser to the Fund gained from their experience as
directors or trustees of most of the registered investment companies advised by
the Adviser, their overall confidence in the Adviser's integrity and competence
they have gained from that experience and the Adviser's responsiveness to
concerns raised by them in the past, including the Adviser's willingness to
consider and implement organizational and operational changes designed to
improve investment results and the services provided to the AllianceBernstein
Funds.

In their deliberations, the directors did not identify any particular
information that was all-important or controlling, and different directors may
have attributed different weights to the various factors.

The directors determined that the overall arrangements (i) between the Fund and
the Adviser, as provided in the Advisory Agreement, and (ii) between the Fund
and the Administrator, as provided in the Administration Agreement, were fair
and reasonable in light of the services performed, expenses incurred and such
other matters as the directors considered relevant in the exercise of their
business judgment.

The material factors and conclusions that formed the basis for the directors
reaching their determinations to approve the continuance of the Advisory
Agreement and Administration Agreement (including their determinations that the
Adviser should continue to be the investment adviser for the Fund, that the
Administrator should continue to be the administrator for the Fund, and that
the


54 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, and to the
Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement, are appropriate) were
separately discussed by the directors.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by the Adviser

The directors noted that, under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to
the oversight of the directors, administers the Fund's business and other
affairs. The Adviser manages the investment of the assets of the Fund,
including making purchases and sales of portfolio securities consistent with
the Fund's investment objective and policies. The Adviser also provides the
Fund with such office space, administrative and other services (exclusive of,
and in addition to, any such services provided by any others retained by the
Fund) and executive and other personnel as are necessary for the Fund's
operations. The Adviser pays all of the compensation of directors of the Fund
who are affiliated persons of the Adviser and of the officers of the Fund.

The directors noted that the Advisory Agreement for the Fund does not contain a
reimbursement provision for the cost of certain administrative and other
services provided by the Adviser. The directors noted that under the
Administration Agreement, the Administrator, subject to the supervision of the
directors, provides the following services: (a) oversees the determination and
publication of the Fund's net asset value; (b) oversees the maintenance of the
books and records of the Fund; (c) arranges for bank or other borrowing by the
Fund, pursuant to the Adviser's determination of the lenders, timing, amount
and terms of any such borrowing; (d) prepares the Fund's federal, state and
local income tax returns; (e) prepares the financial information for the Fund's
proxy statements and reports to shareholders; (f) prepares the Fund's periodic
financial and other reports to regulatory agencies; (g) responds to or refers,
as appropriate, shareholder inquiries; (h) coordinates audit examinations; and
(i) conducts asset maintenance tests and prepares related reports. With respect
to (g) the directors noted that the Fund pays AllianceBernstein Investor
Services to respond to certain types of shareholder inquiries pursuant to a
Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement.

The directors considered the scope and quality of services provided by the
Adviser under the Advisory Agreement and by the Administrator under the
Administration Agreement and noted that the scope of services provided by
advisers and administrators of funds had expanded over time as a result of
regulatory and other developments. The directors noted that, for example, the
Adviser (including in its capacity as Administrator of the Fund) is responsible
for maintaining and monitoring its own and, to varying degrees, the Fund's
compliance programs, and these compliance programs have recently been refined
and enhanced in light of new regulatory requirements. The directors considered
the quality of the in-house investment research capabilities of the Adviser and
the other resources it has dedicated to performing services for the Fund. The
quality


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 55


of administrative and other services, including the Adviser's role in
coordinating the activities of the Fund's other service providers, also were
considered. The directors also considered the Adviser's response to recent
regulatory compliance issues affecting a number of the investment companies in
the AllianceBernstein Funds complex. The directors concluded that, overall,
they were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of services provided to
the Fund under the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability to the Adviser

The directors reviewed a schedule of the revenues, expenses and related notes
indicating the profitability of the Fund to the Adviser (including in its
capacity as Administrator) for calendar years 2004 and 2005 that had been
prepared with an updated expense allocation methodology arrived at in
consultation with an independent consultant. The directors noted that the
updated methodology differed in various respects from the methodology used in
prior years. The directors reviewed the assumptions and methods of allocation
used by the Adviser in preparing fund-specific profitability data, and noted
the Adviser's representation to them that it believed that the methods of
allocation used in preparing the profitability information were reasonable and
appropriate and that the Adviser had previously discussed with the directors
that there is no generally accepted allocation methodology for information of
this type.

The directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of
profitability from fund advisory contracts because comparative information is
not generally publicly available and is affected by numerous factors, including
the structure of the particular adviser, the types of funds it manages, its
business mix, numerous assumptions regarding allocations and the adviser's
capital structure and cost of capital. In considering profitability
information, the directors considered the effect of fall-out benefits on the
Adviser's expenses. The directors focused on the profitability of the Adviser's
relationship with the Fund before taxes. The directors recognized that the
Adviser should generally be entitled to earn a reasonable level of profits for
the services it provides to the Fund and, based on their review, concluded that
they were satisfied that the Adviser's level of profitability from its
relationship with the Fund was not excessive.

Fall-Out Benefits

The directors considered that the Adviser benefits from soft dollar
arrangements whereby it receives brokerage and research services from many of
the brokers and dealers that execute purchases and sales of securities on
behalf of its clients on an agency basis. The directors noted that since the
Fund does not engage in brokerage transactions, the Adviser does not receive
soft dollar benefits in respect of portfolio transactions of the Fund. The
directors also noted that a subsidiary of the Adviser provides certain
shareholder services to the Fund and receives compensation from the Fund for
such services.


56 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


The directors recognized that the Adviser's profitability would be somewhat
lower if the Adviser's subsidiary did not receive the benefits described above.
The directors understood that the Adviser also might derive reputational and
other benefits from its association with the Fund.

Investment Results

In addition to the information reviewed by the directors in connection with the
meeting, the directors receive detailed comparative performance information for
the Fund at each regular Board meeting during the year. At the meeting, the
directors reviewed information prepared by the Adviser based on information
obtained from Lipper showing performance of the Fund as compared to other funds
in the Lipper Emerging Markets Debt Funds Average (the "Lipper Average") for
periods ended June 30, 2006 over the year to date ("YTD"), 1-, 3-, 5- and
10-year and since inception periods (inception July 1993) and for each of the
last ten calendar years, and as compared to the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond
Index Global (the "Index") for periods ended June 30, 2006 over the YTD, 1-,
3-, 5- and 10-year periods (information was not available for the since
inception period). The directors noted that in the Lipper Average comparison
(13 funds in the YTD period, including the Fund and Alliance World Dollar
Government Fund, Inc., another closed-end fund advised by the Adviser), the
Fund's performance was somewhat above the Lipper median in the YTD and since
inception periods, materially above the Lipper median in the 5- and 10-year
periods, somewhat below the Lipper median in the 1-year period and materially
below the Lipper median in the 3-year period, and that the Fund's calendar year
performance was significantly above the Lipper median in 2002 and 2005,
slightly above the Lipper median in 2003, materially above the Lipper median in
1997, 1999 and 2000, somewhat below the Lipper median in 2004 and significantly
below the Lipper median in 1996, 1998 and 2001. The directors further noted
that the Fund outperformed the Index in all periods reviewed. Based on their
review, the directors concluded that the Fund's relative performance over time
was satisfactory.

Advisory Fees and Other Expenses

The directors considered the latest fiscal period actual management fees paid
by the Fund (advisory fees paid to the Adviser and administration fees paid to
the Adviser (in its capacity as Administrator of the Fund)) and information
prepared by Lipper concerning fee rates paid by other funds in the same Lipper
category as the Fund. They compared the combined advisory and administration
fees paid by the Fund to the advisory fees of other funds where there is no
separate administrator. The directors recognized that it is difficult to make
comparisons of advisory fees because there are variations in the services that
are included in the fees paid by other funds.

The directors noted that in connection with the settlement of the market timing
matter with the New York Attorney General in December 2003, the Adviser


ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND o 57


agreed to material reductions (averaging 20%) in the fee schedules of most of
the open-end funds sponsored by the Adviser and that such open-end funds had
benefited from such reductions since 2004. The directors noted that the Fund's
contractual advisory fee rate was higher than the fee rate charged to an
open-end emerging market debt fund managed by the Adviser, and that the Fund's
fee rate exceeded the rate paid by the open-end fund prior to the settlement
related reduction. The directors further noted that, at their September 14 and
16, 2005 meeting, the directors considered and approved the Adviser's proposal,
in response to the directors' request for advisory and administration fee
reductions, to amend the Advisory Agreement effective October 1, 2005 to reduce
the fee rate by 10 basis points (from 1.00% to 0.90%) and the Administrator's
proposal to replace the 15 basis points fee in the Administration Agreement
with an amount equal to no more than the cost to the Administrator of providing
administrative services subject to a maximum of 15 basis points.

The Adviser informed the directors that there are no institutional products
offered by it that have a substantially similar investment style as the Fund.
The directors reviewed information in the Adviser's Form ADV and noted that it
charges institutional clients lower fees for advising comparably sized accounts
using strategies that differ from those of the Fund but which involve
investments in securities of the same type that the Fund invests in (i.e.,
emerging market fixed income).

The Adviser reviewed with the directors the significant differences in the
scope of services it provides to institutional clients and to the Fund. For
example, the Advisory Agreement requires the Adviser to provide, in addition to
investment advice, office facilities and officers (including officers to
provide required certifications). The Adviser also coordinates the provision of
services to the Fund by non-affiliated service providers and is responsible for
the compensation of the Fund's Independent Compliance Officer and certain
related expenses. The provision of these non-advisory services involves costs
and exposure to liability. The Adviser explained that many of these services
normally are not provided to non-investment company clients and that fees
charged to the Fund reflect the costs and risks of the additional obligations.
In light of these facts, the directors did not place significant weight on
these fee comparisons.

In evaluating the Adviser's proposal, the directors took into account the fact
that the Fund utilizes leverage and that as a result the Fund's assets that the
Adviser invests and reinvests are materially greater than its net assets.
However, the advisory fee is calculated based on the Fund's net assets. The
directors noted that many leveraged funds pay advisory fees based on "adjusted
net assets" which results in such funds paying advisory fees on the assets
supported by leverage, and that if the advisory fee paid by the Fund was
expressed as a percentage of its adjusted net assets the fee rate would be
materially lower than the rate stated in the Advisory Agreement.


58 o ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND


The directors also considered the total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
to the fees and expenses of funds within two comparison groups created by
Lipper: an Expense Group and an Expense Universe. Lipper described an Expense
Group as a representative sample of comparable funds and an Expense Universe as
a broader group, consisting of all funds in the Fund's investment
classification/objective with a similar load type as the Fund. The directors
noted that because of the small number of funds in the Fund's Lipper category,
at the request of the Adviser and the Fund's Senior Officer, Lipper expanded
the Expense Group and Expense Universe of the Fund to include funds that are
allowed to utilize leverage but do not do so. The expense ratio of the Fund was
based on the Fund's latest fiscal year expense ratio. The Lipper information
included the pro forma expense ratio provided by the Adviser assuming the new
lower contractual advisory and administration fees effective October 1, 2005
had been in effect throughout fiscal 2006. All references to expense ratios are
to the pro forma expense ratio. The directors recognized that the expense ratio
information for the Fund potentially reflected on the Adviser's provision of
services, as the Adviser is responsible for coordinating services provided to
the Fund by others. The directors noted that the expense ratios of some funds
in the Fund's Lipper category also were lowered by waivers or reimbursements by
those funds' investment advisers, which in some cases were voluntary and
perhaps temporary.

The information reviewed by the directors showed that the Fund's latest fiscal
period actual management fees of 91.1 basis points (the pro forma combined
advisory and administration fees paid under the Advisory and Administration
Agreements) were materially lower than the Expense Group and Expense Universe
medians. The directors also noted that the Fund's pro forma total expense ratio
(which, they noted, benefited from the Fund's relatively large size) was
significantly lower than the Expense Group and Expense Universe medians. The
directors concluded that the Fund's expense ratio was satisfactory.

Economies of Scale

The directors considered that the Fund is a closed-end Fund and that it was not
expected to have meaningful asset growth as a result. In such circumstances,
the directors did not view the potential for realization of economies of scale
as the Fund's assets grow to be a material factor in their deliberations. The
directors noted that if the Fund's net assets were to increase materially as a
result of, e.g., an acquisition or rights offering, they would review whether
potential economies of scale would be realized. In this regard the directors
took account of the fact that it was proposed that the Fund's net assets be
increased modestly by the acquisition of a much smaller fund, Alliance World
Dollar Government Fund, Inc.

Statement of Policies and Procedures for
Proxy Voting

October 2006

1. Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, AllianceBernstein L.P.
("AllianceBernstein", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the
best interests of our clients.  We recognize that this duty requires us to vote
client securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the
best interests of our clients.  Consistent with these obligations, we will
disclose our clients' voting records only to them and as required by mutual
fund vote disclosure regulations.  In addition, the proxy committees may, after
careful consideration, choose to respond to surveys regarding past votes.

This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.  It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting
proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  This statement
applies to AllianceBernstein's growth, value and blend investment groups
investing on behalf of clients in both US and non-US securities.

2.  Proxy Policies

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of proxy voting
subjects that can have a significant effect on the investment value of the
securities held in our clients' accounts.  These policies are not exhaustive
due to the variety of proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider.
AllianceBernstein reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order
to avoid voting decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best
interests.  In reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general
policies:

2.1 Corporate Governance

AllianceBernstein's proxy voting policies recognize the importance of good
corporate governance in ensuring that management and the board of directors
fulfill their obligations to the shareholders.  We favor proposals promoting
transparency and accountability within a company.  We will vote for proposals
providing for equal access to the proxy materials so that shareholders can
express their views on various proxy issues.  We also support the appointment
of a majority of independent directors on key committees and separating the
positions of chairman and chief executive officer.  Finally, because we believe
that good corporate governance requires shareholders to have a meaningful voice
in the affairs of the company, we will support shareholder proposals that
request that companies amend their by-laws to provide that director nominees be
elected by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast.

2.2 Elections of Directors

Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or we determine that there
are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for directors, we will vote
in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.  That said, we believe
that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder actions that have received
significant shareholder support.  We may withhold votes for directors (or vote
against in non-US markets) that fail to act on key issues such as failure to
implement proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote or failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their
shares.  In addition, we will withhold votes for directors who fail to attend
at least seventy-five percent of board meetings within a given year without a
reasonable excuse.  Finally, we may abstain or vote against directors of
non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees
disclosed in the proxy statement.

2.3 Appointment of Auditors

AllianceBernstein believes that the company remains in the best position to
choose the auditors and will generally support management's recommendation.
However, we recognize that there may be inherent conflicts when a company's
independent auditor performs substantial non-audit related services for the
company.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibited certain categories of
services by auditors to US issuers, making this issue less prevalent in the US.
Nevertheless, in reviewing a proposed auditor, we will consider the fees paid
for non-audit services relative to total fees as well as if there are other
reasons to question the independence of the auditors.

2.4 Changes in Legal and Capital Structure

Changes in a company's charter, articles of incorporation or by-laws are often
technical and administrative in nature.  Absent a compelling reason to the
contrary, AllianceBernstein will cast its votes in accordance with the
company's management on such proposals.  However, we will review and analyze on
a case-by-case basis any non-routine proposals that are likely to affect the
structure and operation of the company or have a material economic effect on
the company.  For example, we will generally support proposals to increase
authorized common stock when it is necessary to implement a stock split, aid in
a restructuring or acquisition or provide a sufficient number of shares for an
employee savings plan, stock option or executive compensation plan.  However, a
satisfactory explanation of a company's intentions must be disclosed in the
proxy statement for proposals requesting an increase of greater than one
hundred percent of the shares outstanding.  We will oppose increases in
authorized common stock where there is evidence that the shares will be used to
implement a poison pill or another form of anti-takeover device.  We will
support shareholder proposals that seek to eliminate dual class voting
structures.

2.5 Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions

AllianceBernstein believes proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations
are an extension of the investment decision.  Accordingly, we will analyze such
proposals on a case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of our research
analysts that cover the company and our investment professionals managing the
portfolios in which the stock is held.

2.6 Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights

AllianceBernstein believes that certain fundamental rights of shareholders must
be protected.  We will generally vote in favor of proposals that give
shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the company and oppose any
measure that seeks to limit those rights.  However, when analyzing such
proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal against the
impairment of shareholder rights.

2.7 Anti-Takeover Measures

AllianceBernstein believes that measures that impede corporate transactions
such as takeovers or entrench management not only infringe on the rights of
shareholders but may also have a detrimental effect on the value of the
company.  We will generally oppose proposals, regardless of whether they are
advanced by management or shareholders, the purpose or effect of which is to
entrench management or excessively or inappropriately dilute shareholder
ownership.  Conversely, we support proposals that would restrict or otherwise
eliminate anti-takeover or anti-shareholder measures that have already been
adopted by corporate issuers.  For example, we will support shareholder
proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder rights plan
to a shareholder vote.  We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
completely redeem or eliminate such plans.  Furthermore, we will generally
oppose proposals put forward by management (including the authorization of
blank check preferred stock, classified boards and supermajority vote
requirements) that appear to be anti-shareholder or intended as management
entrenchment mechanisms.

2.8 Executive Compensation

AllianceBernstein believes that company management and the compensation
committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be given latitude to
determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit awards offered to
company employees.  Whether proposed by a shareholder or management, we will
review proposals relating to executive compensation plans on a case-by-case
basis to ensure that the long-term interests of management and shareholders are
properly aligned.  In general, we will analyze the proposed plan to ensure that
shareholder equity will not be excessively diluted taking into account shares
available for grant under the proposed plan as well as other existing plans.
We generally will oppose plans that have below market value grant or exercise
prices on the date of issuance or permit repricing of underwater stock options
without shareholder approval.  Other factors such as the company's performance
and industry practice will generally be factored into our analysis.  We
generally will support shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director compensation.  This policy includes proposals that seek
to specify the measurement of performance based compensation.  In addition, we
will support proposals requiring managements to submit severance packages that
exceed 2.99 times the sum of an executive officer's base salary plus bonus that
are triggered by a change in control to a shareholder vote.  Finally, we will
support shareholder proposals requiring companies to expense stock options
because we view them as a large corporate expense that should be appropriately
accounted for.

2.9  Social and Corporate Responsibility

AllianceBernstein will review and analyze on a case-by-case basis proposals
relating to social, political and environmental issues to determine whether
they will have a financial impact on shareholder value.  We will vote against
proposals that are unduly burdensome or result in unnecessary and excessive
costs to the company.  We may abstain from voting on social proposals that do
not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value.

3. Proxy Voting Procedures

3.1 Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for AllianceBernstein and
consider specific proxy voting matters as necessary.  These committees
periodically review these policies and new types of corporate governance
issues, and decide how we should vote on proposals not covered by these
policies. When a proxy vote cannot be clearly decided by an application of our
stated policy, the proxy committee will evaluate the proposal.  In addition,
the committees, in conjunction with the analyst that covers the company, may
contact corporate management and interested shareholder groups and others as
necessary to discuss proxy issues.  Members of the committee include senior
investment personnel and representatives of the Legal and Compliance
Department.  The committees may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential
conflict of interest (as discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor
adherence to these policies.

3.2 Conflicts of Interest

AllianceBernstein recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxy solicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage, or
we administer, who distributes AllianceBernstein sponsored mutual funds, or
with whom we or an employee has another business or personal relationship that
may affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy.  Similarly, AllianceBernstein may
have a potential material conflict of interest when deciding how to vote on a
proposal sponsored or supported by a shareholder group that is a client.  We
believe that centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy
voting committees and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are
voted with only our clients' best interests in mind.  Additionally, we have
implemented procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a
material conflict of interests, including: (i) on an annual basis, the proxy
committees will take reasonable steps to evaluate the nature of
AllianceBernstein's and our employees' material business and personal
relationships (and those of our affiliates) with any company whose equity
securities are held in client accounts and any client that has sponsored or has
material interest in a proposal upon which we will be eligible to vote;  (ii)
requiring anyone involved in the decision making process to disclose to the
chairman of the appropriate proxy committee any potential conflict that they
are aware of (including personal relationships) and any contact that they have
had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote;  (iii) prohibiting
employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration from
revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted
influence from interested parties;  and (iv) where a material conflict of
interests exists, reviewing our proposed vote by applying a series of objective
tests and, where necessary, considering the views of third party research
services to ensure that our voting decision is consistent with our clients'
best interests.

Because under certain circumstances AllianceBernstein considers the
recommendation of third party research services, the proxy committees will take
reasonable steps to verify that any third party research service is in fact
independent based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.  This
includes reviewing the third party research service's conflict management
procedures and ascertaining, among other things, whether the third party
research service (i) has the capacity and competency to adequately analyze
proxy issues; and (ii) can make such recommendations in an impartial manner and
in the best interests of our clients.

3.3 Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking."  Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting with a designated depositary.  During this blocking period,
shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until the meeting has
taken place and the shares are returned to the clients' custodian banks.
Absent compelling reasons to the contrary, AllianceBernstein believes that the
benefit to the client of exercising the vote does not outweigh the cost of
voting (i.e. not being able to sell the shares during this period).
Accordingly, if share blocking is required we generally abstain from voting
those shares.

In addition, voting proxies of issuers in non-US markets may give rise to a
number of administrative issues that may prevent AllianceBernstein from voting
such proxies.  For example, AllianceBernstein may receive meeting notices
without enough time to fully consider the proxy or after the cut-off date for
voting.  Other markets require AllianceBernstein to provide local agents with
power of attorney prior to implementing AllianceBernstein's voting
instructions.  Although it is AllianceBernstein's policy to seek to vote all
proxies for securities held in client accounts for which we have proxy voting
authority, in the case of non-US issuers, we vote proxies on a best efforts
basis.

3.4 Loanned Securities

Many clients of AllianceBernstein have entered into securities lending
arrangements with agent lenders to generate additional revenue.
AllianceBernstein will not be able to vote securities that are on loan under
these types of arrangements.  However, under rare circumstances, for voting
issues that may have a significant impact on the investment, we may request
that clients recall securities that are on loan if we determine that the
benefit of voting outweighs the costs and lost revenue to the client or fund
and the administrative burden of retrieving the securities.

Investment Professional Conflict of Interest Disclosure

As an investment adviser and fiduciary, Alliance owes its clients and
shareholders an undivided duty of loyalty.  We recognize that conflicts of
interest are inherent in our business and accordingly have developed policies
and procedures (including oversight monitoring) reasonably designed to detect,
manage and mitigate the effects of actual or potential conflicts of interest in
the area of employee personal trading, managing multiple accounts for multiple
clients, including AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and allocating investment
opportunities.  Investment professionals, including portfolio managers and
research analysts, are subject to the above-mentioned policies and oversight
monitoring to ensure that all clients are treated equitably.  We place the
interests of our clients first and expect all of our employees to meet their
fiduciary duties.

Employee Personal Trading.  Alliance has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics that is designed to detect and prevent conflicts of interest when
investment professionals and other personnel of Alliance own, buy or sell
securities which may be owned by, or bought or sold for, clients. Personal
securities transactions by an employee may raise a potential conflict of
interest when an employee owns or trades in a security that is owned or
considered for purchase or sale by a client, or recommended for purchase or
sale by an employee to a client. Subject to the reporting requirements and
other limitations of its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Alliance permits
its employees to engage in personal securities transactions, and also allows
them to acquire investments in the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds through
direct purchase, 401K/profit sharing plan investment and/or notionally in
connection with deferred incentive compensation awards. Alliance's Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct requires disclosure of all personal accounts and
maintenance of brokerage accounts with designated broker-dealers approved by
Alliance.  The Code also requires preclearance of all securities transactions
and imposes a one-year holding period for securities purchased by employees to
discourage short-term trading.

Managing Multiple Accounts for Multiple Clients.  Alliance has compliance
policies and oversight monitoring in place to address conflicts of interest
relating to the management of multiple accounts for multiple clients.
Conflicts of interest may arise when an investment professional has
responsibilities for the investments of more than one account because the
investment professional may be unable to devote equal time and attention to
each account.  The investment professional or investment professional teams for
each client may have responsibilities for managing all or a portion of the
investments of multiple accounts with a common investment strategy, including
other registered investment companies, unregistered investment vehicles, such
as hedge funds, pension plans, separate accounts, collective trusts and
charitable foundations.  Among other things, Alliance's policies and procedures
provide for the prompt dissemination to investment professionals of initial or
changed investment recommendations by analysts so that investment professionals
are better able to develop investment strategies for all accounts they manage.
In addition, investment decisions by investment professionals are reviewed for
the purpose of maintaining uniformity among similar accounts and ensuring that
accounts are treated equitably.  No investment professional that manages client
accounts carrying performance fees is compensated directly or specifically for
the performance of those accounts.  Investment professional compensation
reflects a broad contribution in multiple dimensions to long-term investment
success for our clients and is not tied specifically to the performance of any
particular client's account, nor is it directly tied to the level or change in
level of assets under management.

Allocating Investment Opportunities.  Alliance has policies and procedures
intended to address conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of
investment opportunities.  These policies and procedures are designed to ensure
that information relevant to investment decisions is disseminated promptly
within its portfolio management teams and investment opportunities are
allocated equitably among different clients. The investment professionals at
Alliance routinely are required to select and allocate investment opportunities
among accounts.  Portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector
exposures tend to be similar across similar accounts, which minimizes the
potential for conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of investment
opportunities.  Nevertheless, investment opportunities may be allocated
differently among accounts due to the particular characteristics of an account,
such as size of the account, cash position, tax status, risk tolerance and
investment restrictions or for other reasons.

Alliance's procedures are also designed to prevent potential conflicts of
interest that may arise when Alliance has a particular financial incentive,
such as a performance-based management fee, relating to an account.  An
investment professional may perceive that he or she has an incentive to devote
more time to developing and analyzing investment strategies and opportunities
or allocating securities preferentially to accounts for which Alliance could
share in investment gains.

To address these conflicts of interest, Alliance's policies and procedures
require, among other things, the prompt dissemination to investment
professionals of any initial or changed investment recommendations by analysts;
the aggregation of orders to facilitate best execution for all accounts; price
averaging for all aggregated orders; objective allocation for limited
investment opportunities (e.g., on a rotational basis) to ensure fair and
equitable allocation among accounts; and limitations on short sales of
securities.  These procedures also require documentation and review of
justifications for any decisions to make investments only for select accounts
or in a manner disproportionate to the size of the account.

(a) (3) Portfolio Manager Compensation

Alliance's compensation program for investment professionals is designed to be
competitive and effective in order to attract and retain the highest caliber
employees. The compensation program for investment professionals is designed to
reflect their ability to generate long-term investment success for our clients,
including shareholders of the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds.  Investment
professionals do not receive any direct compensation based upon the investment
returns of any individual client account, nor is compensation tied directly to
the level or change in level of assets under management.  Investment
professionals' annual compensation is comprised of the following:

(i) Fixed base salary:  This is generally the smallest portion of compensation.
The base salary is a relatively low, fixed salary within a similar range for
all investment professionals.  The base salary is determined at the outset of
employment based on level of experience, does not change significantly from
year-to-year and hence, is not particularly sensitive to performance.

(ii) Discretionary incentive compensation in the form of an annual cash bonus:
Alliance's overall profitability determines the total amount of incentive
compensation available to investment professionals. This portion of
compensation is determined subjectively based on qualitative and quantitative
factors.  In evaluating this component of an investment professional's
compensation, Alliance considers the contribution to his/her team or discipline
as it relates to that team's overall contribution to the long-term investment
success, business results and strategy of Alliance.  Quantitative factors
considered include, among other things, relative investment performance (e.g.,
by comparison to competitor or peer group funds or similar styles of
investments, and appropriate, broad-based or specific market indices), and
consistency of performance.  There are no specific formulas used to determine
this part of an investment professional's compensation and the compensation is
not tied to any pre-determined or specified level of performance.  Alliance
also considers qualitative factors such as the complexity and risk of
investment strategies involved in the style or type of assets managed by the
investment professional; success of marketing/business development efforts and
client servicing; seniority/length of service with the firm; management and
supervisory responsibilities; and fulfillment of Alliance's leadership criteria.

(iii) Discretionary incentive compensation in the form of awards under
Alliance's Partners Compensation Plan ("deferred awards"): Alliance's overall
profitability determines the total amount of deferred awards available to
investment professionals.  The deferred awards are allocated among investment
professionals based on criteria similar to those used to determine the annual
cash bonus.  There is no fixed formula for determining these amounts.  Deferred
awards, for which there are various investment options, vest over a four-year
period and are generally forfeited if the employee resigns or Alliance
terminates his/her employment.  Investment options under the deferred awards
plan include many of the same AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds offered to mutual
fund investors, thereby creating a close alignment between the financial
interests of the investment professionals and those of Alliance's clients and
mutual fund shareholders with respect to the performance of those mutual funds.
Alliance also permits deferred award recipients to allocate up to 50% of their
award to investments in Alliance's publicly traded equity securities.(1)

 (iv) Contributions under Alliance's Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan:  The
contributions are based on Alliance's overall profitability.  The amount and
allocation of the contributions are determined at the sole discretion of
Alliance.

(a) (4) The dollar range of the Fund's equity securities owned directly or
beneficially by the Fund's portfolio managers as of the Fund's fiscal year
ended March 31, 2007 is set forth below:

Exhibit 12(a)(1)


CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code


The AllianceBernstein Mutual Fund Complex's code of ethics (this "Code") for
the investment companies within the complex (collectively, the "Funds" and
each, a "Company") applies to each Company's Principal Executive Officer,
Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and Controller (the "Covered
Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

* honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;


* full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
Company;

* compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

* the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

* accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.


II. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts
of Interest

     Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
with the Company.  For the purposes of this Code, members of the Covered
Officer's family include his or her spouse, children, stepchildren, financial
dependents, parents and stepparents.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The Company's
and the investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers
are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that the
Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally
for the Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing
policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
adviser and the Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such
activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and
the adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it
is recognized by the Company's Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Directors")
that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more of
the other Funds or of other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

     Each Covered Officer must:

* not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company whereby
the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Company;

* not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of
the Company;

* not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to trade
personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;

     There are some conflict of interest situations, whether involving a
Covered Officer directly or a member of his family, that should always be
discussed with the General Counsel of Alliance Capital Management L.P.(the
"General Counsel"), if material. Examples of these include:

* service as a director on the board of directors or trustees of any public or
private company (other than a not-for-profit organization);

* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;

* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Company has
current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with,
any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment adviser,
principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof;

* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio transactions or for
selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered
Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III. Disclosure and Compliance
* Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally applicable to the
Company;

* each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the
Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

* each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and the
adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or
submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds; and

* it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.


IV. Reporting and Accountability

     Each Covered Officer must:

* upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the General Counsel that he has
received, read, and understands the Code;

* annually thereafter affirm to the General Counsel that he has complied with
the requirements of the Code;

* complete at least annually a questionnaire relating to affiliations or other
relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest;

* not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
Company or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
are made in good faith; and

* notify the General Counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this
Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by a
Covered Officer will be considered by the Company's Audit Committee (the
"Committee").

The Company will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

* the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations reported to him;

* if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no material
violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any further
action;

* any matter that the General Counsel believes is a material violation will be
reported to the Committee;

* if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
inform and make a recommendation to the Directors, who will consider
appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications
to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the
Covered Officer;

* the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

* any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Company for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Company, the Company's adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, it
is understood that this Code is in all respects separate and apart from, and
operates independently of, any such policies and procedures. In particular, the
Company's and its investment adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.


VI. Amendments

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Directors, including a majority
of independent directors.


VII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Directors, the investment adviser, their
counsel, counsel to the Company and, if deemed appropriate by the Directors of
the Company, to the Directors of the other Funds.


VIII. Internal Use

     The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.


Date: July 22, 2003, as amended March 17, 2004
