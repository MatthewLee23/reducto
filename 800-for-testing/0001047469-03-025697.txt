(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained
under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not
reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period of less
than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

PIMCO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 31, 2003 (unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Corporate Opportunity Fund (the "Fund"), was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on September 13, 2002. Prior to commencing operations on December
27, 2002, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 6,981 shares of
beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,003 to Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"), serves as the Fund's Investment
Manager and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an unlimited amount of
$0.0001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund seeks to maximize total return through a combination of current income
and capital appreciation in a diversified portfolio of U.S. dollar denominated
corporate debt obligations of varying maturities and other income producing
securities.

The Fund issued 55,500,000 shares of common stock, in its initial public
offering. An additional 7,730,000 shares were issued in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. These shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share.
Offering costs of $1,573,068 (representing $0.024 per share) were offset against
the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in excess
of par. The Investment Manager has agreed to pay all offering costs (other than
the sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.03 per share. In
addition, the underwriters' commission and offering costs associated with the
issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of $5,650,000 and $575,000,
respectively, have been charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts
that contain a variety of representations which provide general
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be
remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other assets for which market quotations are readily
available are valued each day at market value. Market value is generally
determined on the basis of the last reported sales price, or if no sales are
reported, based on quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system,
established market makers, or independent pricing services approved by the Board
of Trustees. Any security or other asset for which market quotations are not
readily available is valued at fair value as determined in good faith under
procedures established by the Board of Trustees. The Fund invests substantially
all of its assets in a diversified portfolio of corporate debt obligations of
varying maturities and other corporate income-producing securities. Short-term
debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at
amortized cost or amortized value, which approximates market value. Forward
currency contracts are valued at prevailing forward exchange rates of the
underlying currencies.

(b) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax. Under
certain circumstances, however, the Fund may determine to retain a portion of
its taxable income, if such retention is deemed to be in the interest of the
Fund and its shareholders. In such a circumstance, the Fund may be subject to a
4% excise tax.

(c) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Securities
purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a
month or more after trade date. Realized gains and losses on investments are
determined on the identified cost basis. Interest income is recorded on an
accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities purchased are accreted
or amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities
using the effective interest method. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily.

                                       12
<Page>

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e) INTEREST RATE SWAPS
The Fund may invest in interest rate swap contracts ("swaps") for investment
purposes, to manage its interest rate risk and to add leverage.

Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange by the Fund with a
counterparty of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g.,
an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a
notional amount of principal. Net payments of interest on interest rate swap
agreements are recorded daily as part of interest income.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Investment Manager based upon
quotations from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Fund's Statement of Operations.
Payments received or made, if any, upon termination or maturity of the interest
rate swaps, net of any basis in the interest rate swaps, is recorded as a
realized gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. For a credit default swap
sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the Fund in the
event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of
the referenced debt obligation purchased/received. For a credit default swap
purchased by the Fund, the agreed upon amount received by the Fund in the event
of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as proceeds from
sale/delivery of the referenced debt obligation and the resulting gain or loss
realized on the referenced debt obligation is recorded as such by the Fund.

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit and market
risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no liquid
market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may default
on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the contractual
terms in the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes in net
interest rates.

Interest rate swap contracts outstanding at May 31, 2003 were as follows:

</Table>

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund may enter into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms approved by the Board of Trustees whereby it purchases
securities under agreements to resell at an agreed upon price and date
("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in
the financial statements. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which
consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset backed securities,
are held by the custodian bank until maturity of the repurchase agreement.
Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Fund
require that the market value of the collateral, including accrued interest
thereon, is sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the
counterparty defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if the
counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by
the Fund may be delayed or limited.

                                       13
<Page>

(g) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of
hedging against foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated
investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also
enter these contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign currency
or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country to
another. A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two parties
to buy and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The market
value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in forward
currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at the
applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are
recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the forward contract
matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering these
contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

Forward foreign currency contracts outstanding at May 31, 2003 were:

or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or other
exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund
pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund
bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities
acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid.
The proceeds from the securities sold through the exercise of put options is
decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an written
option could result in the Fund purchasing a security at a price different from
the current market.

Transactions in options written for the period ended May 31, 2003 were:

(i) LOAN PARTICIPATIONS
The Fund may invest in loan participations. When the Fund purchases a loan
participation, the Fund typically enters into a contractual relationship with
the lender or third party selling such participations ("Selling Participant"),
but not the borrower. As a result, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the
borrower, the Selling Participant and any other persons interpositioned between
the Fund and the borrower. The Fund may not directly benefit from the collateral
supporting the senior loan in which it has purchased the loan participation.

(j) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Fund benefits from an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing securities,
they would have generated income for the Fund.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager of the Fund. Subject
to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, the Investment Manager is
responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's business affairs and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment Manager will
receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.60% of the Fund's
average daily net assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding.)

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser") to manage the Fund's investments. Subject to the
supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all investment
decisions with respect to the Fund's assets. The Investment Manager (not the
Fund) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in return for
its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.39% of the Fund's average daily
net assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares that
may be outstanding) for the period from commencement of operations through
December 31, 2007 and at the maximum annual rate of 0.55% of average daily net
assets (inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding) thereafter while the Agreement remains in effect, provided that the
fee will be reduced to 0.325% during the first five years of operations and
0.45% thereafter while the Agreement remains in effect, if and while the
Investment Manager is obligated to pay a fee to Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner &
Smith, Inc. ("Merrill Lynch"), the underwriter of the Fund's shares. The
Investment Manager (not the Fund) has agreed to pay a quarterly fee to Merrill
Lynch at the annual rate of 0.10% of the Fund's average daily net assets
(inclusive of net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding) during the continuance of the Agreement. The Investment Manager
informed the Fund that it paid the Sub-Adviser $2,133,643 in connection with its
sub-advisory services for the period ended May 31, 2003.

3. INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES
For the period ended May 31, 2003, purchases and sales of investments, other
than short-term securities, were $1,441,203,045 and $35,622,477, respectively.

Preferred Shares Series T, 4,520 shares of Preferred Shares Series W, 4,520
shares of Preferred Shares Series TH, and 4,520 shares of Preferred Shares

</Table>

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

We consider customer privacy to be a fundamental aspect of our relationship with
clients. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and
security of our current, prospective and former clients' personal information.
We have developed policies designed to protect this confidentiality, while
allowing client needs to be served.

OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION
In the course of providing you with products and services, we may obtain

information captured on our internet web sites.

RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY
We do not disclose any personal or account information provided by you or
gathered by us to non-affiliated third parties, except as required or permitted
by law. As is common in the industry, non-affiliated companies may from time to
time be used to provide certain services, such as preparing and mailing
prospectuses, reports, account statements and other information, conducting
research on client satisfaction, and gathering shareholder proxies. We may also
retain non-affiliated companies to market our products and enter in joint
marketing agreements with other companies. These companies may have access to
your personal and account information, but are permitted to use the information
solely to provide the specific service or as otherwise permitted by law. We may
also provide your personal and account information to your brokerage or

We do reserve the right to disclose or report personal information to
non-affiliated third parties in limited circumstances where we believe in good
faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law
enforcement authorities, to protect our rights or property, or upon reasonable

may disclose information about you or your accounts to a non-affiliated third
party at your request or if you consent in writing to the disclosure.

your account or to provide you with information about products and services that
we believe may be of interest to you. The information we share may include, for
example, your participation in our mutual funds or other investment programs,
your ownership of certain types of accounts (such as IRAs), or other data about
your accounts. Our affiliates, in turn, are not permitted to share your
information with non-affiliated entities, except as required or permitted by
law.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEDURES
We take seriously the obligation to safeguard your non-public personal
information. We have implemented procedures designed to restrict access to your
non-public personal information to our personnel who need to know that
information to provide products or services to you. To guard your non-public
personal information, physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are in
place.

      (a) All significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
          controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial data and have
          identified for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
          internal controls; and

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of most recent evaluation, including any corrective
     actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
