January 14, 2004

Dear Shareholder:

I am writing to you as the independent chairman of the board of trustees of your
Colonial fund. I have been privileged to serve on the board of the Colonial
funds for more than three years and on the board of many of the affiliated
Columbia funds for more than seven years. On December 8, 2003 the board of
trustees elected me the chairman. Over those seven years I have gained a deep
sense of responsibility for the continued success of our funds. Needless to say,
the entire board shares that commitment to you.

These have been troubling times in the fund industry, with newspapers reporting
widely on trading and governance failings. Your board has been energetic over
the past year in strengthening our organization and our capacity to effectively
oversee the Colonial funds.

First, as already indicated, the trustees in December elected an independent
trustee to chair our twelve person board. All of the trustees are completely
independent of the advisor and its affiliates except for the president of the
funds, Joseph Palombo. Each committee of the board is comprised only of
independent trustees.

Second, last year we reconfigured the membership of the four person audit
committee to include only persons qualifying as "audit committee financial
experts" under the demanding standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Few
audit committees are fortunate to possess such a breadth and depth of financial
experience.

Third, we strengthened our oversight capacity by appointing Martha Fox as chief
compliance officer of the Colonial funds, reporting directly to your fund's
audit committee. We also assigned board members to four separate investment
oversight committees, each better able to monitor performance of individual
funds.

Fourth, with guidance from our board the investment advisor last year increased
its vigilance to identify and discourage trading in open end mutual fund shares
by speculators. Monitoring personnel have attempted to identify and reject
frequent traders, but frankly that effort by itself cannot be 100% effective.
Accordingly, in February 2003 we implemented 2% redemption penalties in the open
end international funds most subject to market timing, and we are considering
still broader application of redemption fees to curb further attempts to profit
from the open end funds by short-term trading. We are also closely monitoring
legislative and regulatory initiatives that would aid in preventing abuses of
open end funds that currently cannot be detected directly by management or our
transfer agent.

Finally, to further align the interests of the trustees with those of our
shareholders, the board late last year voted to double the required investment
by each trustee in the funds that we oversee. At the same time, new policies
were instituted requiring all investment personnel and trustees to hold any
mutual fund shares for a minimum of one year (unless extraordinary circumstances
warrant an exception to be granted by a board committee).

Undoubtedly, more improvements will be made in the period ahead, but the board
wants you to know that we take our responsibilities very seriously and we commit
to you our continued efforts to serve your interests.

Sincerely,

/s/ Thomas C. Theobald

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

                                                                           1

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

It was another solid year for the US bond market. However, the positive gains
reported from all major sectors masked an extremely volatile environment. Most
of the gains were actually earned in the first half of the reporting period and
they were sufficient to offset losses or declining performance in the second
half.

From December through mid-June, interest rates generally declined and bond
prices rose as the economy struggled to gain a solid footing and the nation
prepared to go to war. In June, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to a
45-year low of just over 3.1%. High-yield bonds were the primary beneficiaries
of this trend as investors seemed willing to put their fears aside and look to
better times ahead. However, after the major military battles of the war were
declared over and the economy showed clear signs of picking up, interest rates
began to rise and bond prices came down in most sectors. The 10-year yield
reached a high of 4.4% in August, then moved within a tight range around 4.0% to
4.2% for the remainder of the period. As the environment changed, high-yield and
mortgage bonds held up better than other sectors while Treasury bonds lagged.

This reversal of fortune for bonds and a shift of investor enthusiasm back to
stocks, which drove equity returns back into double digit territory, serve as a
reminder that a diversified portfolio may offer the best opportunity for
long-term investment success. Talk to your financial advisor if you're uncertain
about the level of diversification of your portfolio. Your advisor can help you
keep your investments on track.

As always, thank you for investing in Colonial Funds. We look forward to
continuing to serve you in the years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Joseph R. Palombo
Joseph R. Palombo
President

Sector breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of net assets (including
auction preferred shares). Quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of
total investments, including short-term obligations. Ratings shown in the
quality breakdown represent the highest rating assigned to a particular bond by
one of the following nationally-recognized rating agencies: Standard & Poor's
Corporation, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Investors Service, Inc.

Because the trust is actively managed, there can be no guarantee that the trust
will continue to maintain this quality breakdown or invest in these sectors in
the future.

For the 12-month period ended November 30, 2003, Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust returned 8.75%, based on investment at net asset value. The trust slightly
outperformed its peer group, the Lipper High Yield Municipal Debt Funds Category
average, which averaged 8.61%.(1)

In the first half of the period, the trust's performance was helped by its
underweight in high-yield bonds, which lagged higher-quality issues when
interest rates were falling. This underweight hurt the trust slightly in the
second half of the period, when high-yield, lower-quality bonds outperformed as
the economy improved and interest rates rose. Yet, its position in high yield
was substantial enough to make a positive overall contribution to the fund's
performance.

We kept the trust's duration short relative to its peer group. Duration is a
measure of interest rate sensitivity. We lower, or shorten, duration when we
expect interest rates to rise and bond prices to fall. This move helped
performance as rising interest rates hampered bond returns.

Leveraged positions provided the trust with additional income during the period.
We have, in effect, "borrowed against" the trust's investment positions by
issuing preferred shares, which pay out a short-term variable rate. When those
preferred shares were issued in 1999, we invested the proceeds in bonds with
longer maturities. During this reporting period, the payout rate of preferred
shares was much lower than the yield the trust earned from those longer-maturity
bonds. The trust issued preferred shares because the leverage they provided made
it possible to enhance yield. However, the use of leverage increases the
likelihood of share price volatility and market risk. In order to reduce that
extra price volatility, we can hedge using futures contracts. When we shorten
duration (decrease price volatility) using futures, and bond prices rise, we
show losses on the futures contracts that are typically offset, at least
partially, by unrealized price gains on the bonds held.

Specific issues also contributed positively to performance, including
HealthEast, a Minnesota hospital and US Airways (0.7% and 0.3% of total
investments, respectively)(2) and other airline bonds. The trust's stake in zero
coupon municipal bonds, which did especially well early in the period, further
helped returns.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

The trust's stake in nursing home bonds detracted from performance because many
issuers suffered as liability insurance costs soared and some fiscally-strapped
states lowered Medicaid payments. We have reduced our nursing home stake. We
increased the fund's exposure to more economically-sensitive sectors, such as
paper, where we added bonds issued on behalf of Weyerhaeuser (0.2% of total
investments), which made a positive contribution to performance.

Going forward, we expect high-yield municipal bonds to do well as the economy
improves and interest rates slowly rise.

Past performance is no guarantee of future investment results. Current
performance may be higher or lower than the performance data shown.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in
high-yield securities offers the potential for high current income and
attractive total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks
include default of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax
for individuals and corporations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

November 30, 2003

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial High Income Municipal Trust (the "Trust"), is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.


INVESTMENT GOAL
The Trust seeks to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes. The Trust's secondary goal is to seek total return.


TRUST SHARES
The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 4,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").


NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.


SECURITY VALUATION
Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The service may use
various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Certain securities, which tend to be
more thinly traded and of lesser quality, are priced based on fundamental
analysis of the financial condition of the issuer and the estimated value of any
collateral. Valuations developed through pricing techniques may vary from the
actual amounts realized upon sale of the securities, and the potential variation
may be greater for those securities valued using fundamental analysis. Debt
securities for which quotations are readily available are valued at an
over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation.

Short-term obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost,
which approximates market value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, which tend to
be more thinly traded and of lesser quality are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures established by
and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.


SECURITY TRANSACTIONS
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.


FUTURES CONTRACTS
The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin payable or receivable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

OPTIONS
The Fund may write call and put options on futures it owns or in which it may
invest. Writing put options tends to increase the fund's exposure to the
underlying instrument. Writing call options tends to decrease the Fund's
exposure to the underlying instrument. When the Fund writes a call or put
option, an amount equal to the premium received is recorded as a liability and
subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as
realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or
closed are added to the proceeds or offset against the amounts paid on the
underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. The Fund
as a writer of an option has no control over whether the underlying future may
be sold (call) or purchased (put) and as a result bears the market risk of an
unfavorable change in the price of the future underlying the written option.
There is the risk the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

November 30, 2003

                                                                          22

Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid
market.

The Fund may also purchase put and call options. Purchasing call options tends
to increase the Fund's exposure to the underlying instrument. Purchasing put
options tends to decrease the Fund's exposure to the underlying instrument. The
Fund pays a premium, which is included in the Fund's Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
current value of the option. The risk associated with purchasing put and call
options is limited to the premium paid. Premiums paid for purchasing options
which expire are treated as realized losses. Premiums paid for purchasing
options which are exercised or closed are added to the amounts paid or offset
against the proceeds on the underlying future transaction to determine the
realized gain or loss. The Trust's custodian will set aside cash or liquid
portfolio securities equal to the amount of the written options contract
commitment in a separate account.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES
Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from registration. In
some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust or
in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many
restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale.


DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES
The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Fund
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust's custodian will
set aside cash or liquid portfolio securities equal to the amount of the delayed
delivery commitment in a separate account.


INCOME RECOGNITION
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities.


FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS
The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, by distributing
substantially all of its taxable or tax-exempt income, if any, for its tax year,
and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, by
distributing in each calendar year substantially all of its net investment
income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Trust will not be
subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
provision is recorded.


DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on ex-date. Distributions to
Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of each
dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven
days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on November 30, 2003 was 1.05%.
For the year ended November 30, 2003, the Trust declared dividends to Auction
Preferred shareholders amounting to $1,158,676, representing an average APS
dividend rate of 0.97%.


NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Trust's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

For the year ended November 30, 2003, permanent differences resulting primarily
from differing treatments for market discount reclassifications, discount
accretion/premium amortization on debt securities and expired capital loss
carryforward were identified and reclassified among the components of the
Trust's net assets as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
      UNDISTRIBUTED          ACCUMULATED
  NET INVESTMENT INCOME   NET REALIZED LOSS   PAID-IN CAPITAL

         $(8,547)            $5,276,170         $(5,267,623)
</Table>

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November 30, 2003
and November 30, 2002 was as follows:

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES


On April 1, 2003, Colonial Management Associates, Inc., the previous investment
advisor to the Trust, merged into Columbia Management Advisors, Inc.
("Columbia"), formerly known as Columbia Management Co., an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation. As a result of the
merger, Columbia now serves as the Trust's investment advisor. The merger did
not change the way the Trust is managed, the investment personnel assigned to
manage the Trust or the fees paid by the Trust.


INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE
Columbia is the investment advisor to the Trust and provides administrative and
other services. Columbia receives a monthly fee at the annual rate of 0.75% of
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the APS.


PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street").

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the APS,
exceed $50 million, an additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is
calculated by taking into account the fees payable to State Street under the
Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to the average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to the APS, of the Trust for that month. The Trust
also pays additional fees for pricing services. For the year ended November 30,
2003, the effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.050%. Columbia pays
the total fees collected to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.


CUSTODY CREDITS
The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Trust could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an
income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.


FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES
The Trust pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of
the Trust's assets.


NOTE 5. PREFERRED SHARES


The Trust currently has outstanding 4,800 APS.  The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At November 30, 2003,
there were no restrictions on the Trust.


NOTE 6. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES
For the year ended November 30, 2003, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $42,974,746 and
$48,752,264, respectively.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES

INDUSTRY FOCUS
The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES
Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. Government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk bonds." Economic
downturns and industry events may disrupt the high yield market and impair the
ability of issuers to repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in
interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on the value of such
obligations. Moreover, high-yield securities may be less liquid due to the
extent that there is no established retail secondary market and because of a
decline in the value of such securities.

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
The Trust had greater than 5% of its net assets at November 30, 2003, invested
in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Florida, Illinois,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas and their respective political
subdivisions, agencies and public authorities to obtain funds for various
purposes. The Trust is more susceptible to economic and political factors
adversely affecting issuers of each respective state's specific municipal
securities than are municipal bond funds that are not concentrated to the same
extent in these issuers.

(a) The Trust changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to November 30.
(b) Per share data was calculated using average shares outstanding during the

(c) Effective December 1, 2001, the Trust adopted the provisions of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
    market discount on all debt securities. The effect of this change, for the
    year ended November 30, 2002, was to increase the ratio of net investment
    income to average net assets from 8.31% to 8.36% and increase the ratio of
    net investment income (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders) from 7.48% to 7.53%. The impact to net investment income and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

TO THE TRUSTEES AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF COLONIAL HIGH INCOME MUNICIPAL TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Colonial High Income Municipal
Trust (the "Trust") at November 30, 2003, and the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the periods
indicated, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Trust's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at November 30, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

COLONIAL HIGH INCOME MUNICIPAL TRUST

Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Agent"), as
agent under the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the
Plan, the provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making such
an election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed directly
to the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the Trust.
If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend or
distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will be
issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the market
price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares at such
time, or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable only in
cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust shares in
the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average
per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value
of the Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust. In
circumstances in which the net asset value of Trust shares is more than 5% below
their market price, participants in the Plan will be issued shares through the
Plan at a price exceeding net asset value.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to the
participant's account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be
made for any fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's
notice of election to participate in or withdraw from the Plan must be received
by the Plan Agent before the record date for a dividend in order to be given
effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010, or by phone at 1-800-730-6001.

     Stein Roe Funds were combined into one board of trustees responsible for
     the oversight of both fund groups (collectively, the "Liberty Board"). In
     October 2003, the trustees on the Liberty Board were elected to the boards
     of the Columbia Funds (the "Columbia Board") and of the CMG Fund Trust (the
     "CMG Funds Board"); simultaneous with that election, Patrick J. Simpson and
     Richard L. Woolworth, who had been directors on the Columbia Board and
     trustees on the CMG Funds Board, were appointed to serve as trustees of the

     the All-Star Funds, currently consisting of 2 funds, which are advised by

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of
the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each proposal and votes the
proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the proposal would be
expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund. The Advisor
determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential economic
return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any benefit to
the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. A member of the
Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for which he or she
has a conflict of interest


<PAGE>



by reason of a direct relationship with the issuer or other party affected by a
given proposal. Persons making recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its
members are required to disclose to the Committee any relationship with a party
making a proposal or other matter known to the person that would create a
potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has three classes of proxy proposals. The first two classes are
predetermined guidelines to vote for or against specific proposals, unless
otherwise directed by the Proxy Committee. The third class is for proposals
given special consideration by the Proxy Committee. In addition, the Proxy
Committee considers requests to vote on proposals in the first two classes other
than according to the predetermined guidelines.

The Advisor generally votes in favor of proposals related to the following
matters: selection of auditors (unless the auditor receives more than 50% of its
revenues from non-audit activities from the company and its affiliates),
election of directors (unless the proposal gives management the ability to alter
the size of the board without shareholder approval), different persons for
chairman of the board/chief executive officer (unless, in light of the size of
the company and the nature of its shareholder base, the role of chairman and CEO
are not held by different persons), compensation (if provisions are consistent
with standard business practices), debt limits (unless proposed specifically as
an anti-takeover action), indemnifications (unless for negligence and or
breaches of fiduciary duty), meetings, name of company, principal office (unless
the purpose is to reduce regulatory or financial supervision), reports and
accounts (if the certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been
provided), par value, shares (unless proposed as an anti-takeover action), share
repurchase programs, independent committees, and equal opportunity employment.

The Advisor generally votes against proposals related to the following matters:
super majority voting, cumulative voting, preferred stock, warrants, rights,
poison pills, reclassification of common stock and meetings held by written
consent.

The Advisor gives the following matters special consideration: new proposals,
proxies of investment company shares (other than those covered by the
predetermined guidelines), mergers/acquisitions (proposals where a hostile
merger/acquisition is apparent or where the Advisor represents ownership in more
than one of the companies involved), shareholder proposals (other than those
covered by the predetermined guidelines), executive/director compensation (other
than those covered by the predetermined guidelines), pre-emptive rights and
proxies of international issuers which block securities sales between submission
of a proxy and the meeting (proposals for these securities are voted only on the
specific instruction of the Proxy Committee and to the extent practicable in
accordance with predetermined guidelines).

In addition, if a portfolio manager or other party involved with a client of the
Advisor or Fund account concludes that the interest of the client or Fund
requires that a proxy be voted on a proposal other than according to the
predetermined guidelines, he or she may request that the Proxy Committee
consider voting the proxy differently. If any person (or entity) requests the
Proxy Committee (or any of its members) to vote a proxy other than according to
a predetermined guideline, that person must furnish to the Proxy Committee a
written explanation of the reasons for the request and a description of the
person's (or entity's) relationship with the party proposing the matter to
shareholders or any other matter known to the person (or entity) that would
create a potential conflict of interest.

The Proxy Committee may vary from the predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the


<PAGE>



current or potential market value of the issuer's securities or to affect
adversely the best interest of the client. References to the best interest of a
client refer to the interest of the client in terms of the potential economic
return on the client's investment. In determining the vote on any proposal, the
Proxy Committee does not consider any benefit other than benefits to the owner
of the securities to be voted.

The Advisor's Proxy Committee is composed of operational and investment
representatives of its regional offices as well as senior representatives of the
Advisor's equity investments, equity research, compliance and legal functions.
During the first quarter of each year, the Proxy Committee reviews all
guidelines and establishes guidelines for expected new proposals. In addition to
these reviews and its other responsibilities described above, its functions
include annual review of its Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures to ensure
consistency with internal policies and regulatory agency policies, and
development and modification of voting guidelines and procedures as it deems
appropriate or necessary.

The Advisor uses Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third party
vendor, to implement its proxy voting process. ISS provides proxy analysis,
record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

      similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
      required disclosure.

      reporting that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal half-year (the
      registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that
      has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
      registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 99.CODE ETH

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

                  This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies
         within the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the
         "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal Executive
         Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, and
         Director of Trustee Administration (the "Covered Officers") for the
         purpose of promoting:

                -   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling
                    of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal
                    and professional relationships;

                -   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure
                    in reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits
                    to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in
                    other public communications made by a Fund;

                -   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                    regulations;

                -   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to
                    an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

                -   accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of
           business ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give
           rise to actual or apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

                  . The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
         (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be
         primarily responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code
         Officer"). The Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management
         Group Compliance Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his or
         her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a temporary
         basis.

                  Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief
         Legal Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
         rules promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund shall
         assist the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The
         Chief Legal Officer shall be responsible for applying this Code to
         specific situations in which questions are presented under it (in
         consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and has the
         authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However,
         any
<PAGE>
         waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
         Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

III.     MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
         Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his/her
         service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if
         a Covered Officer, or a family member, receives improper personal
         benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with a Fund.

                  Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships
         between Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict
         of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
         "Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers
         Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
         certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
         other property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated
         persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance
         programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and
         correct, violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not
         intended to, repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and such
         conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

                  Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
         personal benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
         contractual relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser,
         administrator, principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent
         and/or transfer agent (each, a "Service Provider") of which the Covered
         Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
         recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of
         their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for a Service Provider, or
         for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
         decisions that will have different effects on the Service Provider and
         a Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
         inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the
         Service Provider and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
         Officers of their duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is
         recognized by the Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers
         or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this
         or other codes.

                  Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if
         such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the Company
         Act and the Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
         conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep
         in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching
         principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not
         be placed improperly before the interest of a Fund.
<PAGE>
                  Each Covered Officer must:

                    -    not use personal influence or personal relationships
                         improperly to influence investment decisions or
                         financial reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered
                         Officer or an immediate family member would benefit
                         personally to the detriment of a Fund; and

                    -    not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take
                         action, for the individual personal benefit of the
                         Covered Officer or an immediate family member rather
                         than the benefit of the Fund.(1).

                  There are some conflict of interest situations that must be
         approved by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief Legal
         Officer. Those situations include, but are not limited to,:

                    -    service as director on the board of any public or
                         private company;

                    -    the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the
                         aggregate from a third party that does or seeks to do
                         business with the Funds during any 12-month period;

                    -    the receipt of any entertainment from any company with
                         which a Fund has current or prospective business
                         dealings, unless such entertainment is
                         business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
                         time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any
                         question of impropriety;

                    -    any material ownership interest in, or any consulting
                         or employment relationship with, any Fund service
                         providers, other than its investment adviser, principal
                         underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
                         thereof;

                    -    a direct or indirect material financial interest in
                         commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a
                         Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for
                         selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
                         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
                         compensation or equity ownership.

IV.      DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

                  Each Covered Officer shall:

                  -     be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally
                        applicable to the Funds;

- --------

(1) For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered
Officers shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group
Code of Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person"
under such Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as
provided in such Code.
<PAGE>
                  -     not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
                        misrepresent, facts about any Fund to others, whether
                        within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                        trustees and auditors, and to governmental regulators
                        and self-regulatory organizations;

                  -     to the extent appropriate within his/her area of
                        responsibility, consult with other officers and
                        employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of
                        promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                        understandable disclosure in the reports and documents

                  -     promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
                        imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.       REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

                  Each Covered Officer must:

                  -     upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered
                        Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has
                        received, read and understands the Code;

                  -     annually affirm to the Board compliance with the
                        requirements of the Code;

                  -     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                        employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                        reports of potential violations that are made in good
                        faith;

                  -     notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer
                        promptly if he/she knows of any violation of this Code;
                        and

                  -     respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires
                        circulated periodically in connection with the
                        preparation of disclosure documents for the Funds.

                  The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities
            related to this Code.

                  The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in
            investigating and enforcing this Code:

                  -     The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will
                        take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
                        violation reported to him/her;

                  -     If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer
                        and the Code Officer believes that no violation has
                        occurred, the Code Officer will notify the person(s)
                        reporting the potential violation, and no further action
                        is required;

                  -     Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code
                        Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the
                        Audit Committee;
<PAGE>
                  -     If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has
                        occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to
                        the Board, which will consider appropriate action, which
                        may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                        applicable policies and procedures; notification to the
                        Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or
                        a recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered
                        Officer;

                  -     The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting
                        waivers in its sole discretion;

                  -     Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the
                        extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

                  The Chief Legal Officer shall:

                  -     report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals
                        provided in accordance with Section III of this Code;
                        and

                  -     report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations
                        of, or material issues arising under, this Code.


VI.      OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                  This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the
         Funds for the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
         rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies
         thereunder. Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Funds or the
         Funds' Service Providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
         activities (including, but not limited to, personal trading activities)
         of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
         superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
         with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment
         advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1
         under the Company Act and any policies and procedures of the Service
         Providers are separate requirements applicable to the Covered Officers
         and are not part of this Code.

VII.     AMENDMENTS

                  All material amendments to this Code must be approved or
         ratified by the Board, including a majority of independent directors.

VIII.    CONFIDENTIALITY

                  All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to
         this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
         protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this
         Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
         Board, the Covered Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code Officer,
         outside audit firms and legal counsel to the Funds, and senior
         management of Columbia Management Group.
<PAGE>
IX.      INTERNAL USE

                  The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds
         and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as
         to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the

            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
