Item 1. Reports to Shareholders.

The Trust's semi-annual report transmitted to shareholders pursuant to Rule
30e-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is as follows:

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this report, you'll learn about how your investment in Van Kampen High
       Income Trust II performed during the semiannual period. The portfolio
       management team will provide an overview of the market conditions and
       discuss some of the factors that affected investment performance during
       the reporting period. In addition, this report includes the trust's
       financial statements and a list of trust investments as of June 30, 2004.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. Trusts are subject to market risk, which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and
       that the value of trust shares may therefore be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index is generally representative of
high-yield securities. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales
charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be
considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2004

Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the Adviser's High Yield team.
Current team members include Gordon Loery, Executive Director of the Adviser;
Josh Givelber and Chad Liu, Vice Presidents of the Adviser; and Sheila Finnerty,
Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET CONDITIONS

Coming off a banner year in 2003, high-yield bonds continued their strong
performance through the end of January 2004, endured a difficult period from
February through May, then staged a rally during June. The CSFB High Yield
Index, a broad benchmark for the high-yield market, returned 2.47 percent for
the first six months of 2004.

Over the past 18 months, whether the market was rallying or giving back some
gains, high-yield bonds have had strong fundamental factors in their favor.
These factors included an improving U.S. economic environment, better corporate
earnings overall and a low default rate for high-yield issuers. In 2003, and
continuing through January 2004, technical factors, such as supply and demand
within the high-yield bond market, were also very positive. Though high-yield
companies were bringing a tremendous volume of new issues to market--made up
mostly of refinanced high-yield bonds or refinanced bank debt--through January
2004 new-issue supply was easily taken up by strong demand from mutual funds,
institutional investors and individuals. Beginning this past February, however,
demand slackened and money flowed out of high-yield funds as interest rates
began to rise and some investors took profits, while others shifted their
portfolio allocation out of high yield. Typically, high-yield and Treasury-bond
performance are not strongly correlated, but during the first half of 2004 there
was more correlation than usual because of narrow high-yield interest-rate
spreads compared with Treasuries. As Treasuries reacted negatively to
interest-rate fears, high-yield bonds followed, but to a lesser extent.

In addition, from February to May, financial markets experienced significantly
increased volatility--rarely helpful to high-yield performance. The rise in
volatility was attributable to terrorism fears, higher oil prices and higher
interest rates. Attitudes concerning the direction of interest rates underwent a
dramatic shift at that time. Investors went from thinking that interest rates
would remain relatively low for a long period to acknowledging that the Fed
could change direction in order to fight inflation, and push the federal funds
rate up--perhaps as much as 3 percent over the next 12 to 24 months.

Beginning in May, the market began to acclimate itself to the new interest-rate
environment and to settle down somewhat. As a result, the high-yield market
posted gains during June as some new money came into this market. Perhaps

more importantly, there were no significant outflows from most high-yield mutual
funds in June.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly. On an NAV basis, the trust outperformed its
benchmark, the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield Index. (See table below.)

The trust's performance was helped by its lack of exposure to the airline
industry as well as favorable security selection within the utilities sector. In
addition, though the overall default rate with the high-yield bond asset class
was low, there were some defaults among high-yield companies during the period;
the fact that the trust did not hold these problem credits contributed to the
trust's performance. When selecting high-yield issues for the trust's portfolio,
we have historically avoided most start-up companies and attempt to look for
seasoned issuers with positive cash flow--companies that we believe will prosper
in good or bad economic times.

Detracting from overall performance during the period was unfavorable security
selection within the chemicals, forest products and gaming/leisure sectors.
Other factors that detracted from the trust's performance were its relatively
low-yield, higher overall-quality composition and its shorter average maturity
compared with the overall market. During the period we worked to increase the
trust's yield and purchased lower-grade issues at longer maturities.

The trust uses leverage on an ongoing basis to enhance its dividend to common
shareholders. The trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance
of preferred shares. The proceeds are then invested in longer-term securities,
taking advantage of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. Though
short-term rates have risen since the start of 2004, using leverage through the
"carry trade" continued to be beneficial for the trust during the period.

<PAGE>

Going forward, though we think interest rates will continue to rise as the Fed
persists in tightening credit, we believe that high-yield bonds should perform
reasonably well over the coming months for two reasons: First, the performance
of high-yield issues should continue to be driven by favorable fundamental
factors. Second, now that investors have seemingly come to terms with the
necessity for higher interest rates, the relationship between supply and demand
should gradually turn more favorable within the high-yield market.

(a)Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the

   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period

   shareholders.

(c)As required, effective January 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the period ended December 31, 2001 was to decrease net investment income per
   share by $.02, increase net realized and unrealized gains and losses per
   share by $.02 and decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net
   assets applicable to common shares by .40%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to December 31, 2001 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

    The Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed
delivery" basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The
Trust will segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at
least equal to the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase
commitments until after payment is made. At June 30, 2004, the Trust had
$320,000 of when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in terms of debt
instruments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED) continued

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2003, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $25,739,010 which expires between December 31,
2007 and December 31, 2011.

    At June 30, 2004, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                             <C>
Cost of investments for tax purposes........................    $64,710,380
                                                                ===========
Gross tax unrealized appreciation...........................    $ 2,779,092
Gross tax unrealized depreciation...........................     (4,279,787)
                                                                -----------
Net tax unrealized depreciation on investments..............    $(1,500,695)
                                                                ===========
</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually to common shareholders. Distributions from net
realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains which are
included in ordinary income for tax purposes.

    For tax purposes, the determination of a return of capital distribution is
made at the end of the Trust's fiscal year. Therefore, while it is likely that a
portion of the Trust's distribution will ultimately be characterized as a return
of capital for tax purposes, no such designation has been made for the six
months ended June 30, 2004.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31,
2003 was as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                             <C>
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................    $3,889,082
  Return of capital.........................................       101,822
                                                                ----------
                                                                $3,990,904
                                                                ==========
</Table>

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets of the Trust.

    For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $1,800 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the Trust
is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended June
30, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $12,100 representing
Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost
of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are

                                                                              19

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED) continued

reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the Statement
of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments were $23,737,820 and $22,161,747, respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

As of June 30, 2004, the Trust has outstanding 1,112 Auction Preferred Shares
("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is currently reset every
28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on June 30, 2004 was
1.328%. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, the rates ranged from 1.068%
to 1.328%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of Preferred Share Maintenance
expense.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

5. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                                                                              21

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing State Street Bank
and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

      registrant and have:

      a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
         disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

         which this report is being prepared;

         reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting; and

         record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
         controls over financial reporting.
