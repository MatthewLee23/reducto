NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("the  Company")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
         Company  on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
         Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series G is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series G can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series G from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or "the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  G  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series G values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series G's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series G, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series G's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-strategy Series G does not take a liquidity discount on
         any  Investment   Funds  held.  The  underlying   investments  of  each
         Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as described in each
         Investment Fund's financial statements. The Investment Funds may invest
         a  portion  of  their  assets  in  restricted   securities   and  other
         investments that are illiquid.

         B.   FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series G's subsequent
         registration  under  the 1933  Act have  been  deferred  and are  being
         amortized over the twelve months commencing after the effective date of
         such registration statement.

         C.   INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series G's taxable income
         or loss.

         D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus accrued interest.

         E.   CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

         Contributions    received   in   advance   of   $5,467,150   represents
         subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts on
         October 1, 2004.  Such amount is largely  represented  within the short
         term investments  balance as depicted on the  accompanying  schedule of
         investments.

         F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee equal to 0.188%
         (2.25% on an annualized  basis) of end of month Members'  capital.  The
         Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  related  expenses of
         $45,880  to  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  during  the  six  months  ended
         September 30, 2004.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent affiliated with the Adviser, will
         generally  be  entitled  to  receive  a fee from each  investor  in the
         Company  whose  Units  the agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  Units.  For  the  six  months  ended
         September  30,  2004,   CGM  earned   $766,815  in  placement  fees  on
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G  Units.  Such  fees  are  deducted  from  an
         investor's gross contribution amount.

         The Company has entered into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
         additional   placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  Units.
         Placement fees may range from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser, and/or
         its affiliates,  will pay the placement  agents an annual fee,  payable

         resources (or those of its affiliates).

         Multi-Strategy  Series G pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on an
         annualized basis) for  administration  based primarily upon average net
         assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and will reimburse  certain
         expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  has retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),  an
         independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A.,
         to  assist  in the  performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  PFPC

         retainer of $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of
         $500. Such Director fees are allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based
         on the  relative  net assets of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an
         "interested  person"  does not  receive  any  annual  or other fee from
         Multi-Adviser  Hedge Fund  Portfolios LLC. All Directors are reimbursed
         for all  reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed
         related  to  Directors  by  Multi-Strategy  Series G for the six months
         ended September 30, 2004 were $12,528.

         of Multi-Strategy Series G's assets and provides custodial services for

         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series G.

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  Units  may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional  subscriptions for Units in Multi-Strategy Series G. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  to
         repurchase Units from Members pursuant to written tenders by members on
         such terms and  conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects  that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to  repurchase  Units from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series G for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

         Multi-Strategy Series G invests trade various financial instruments and
         enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("the  Company")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
         Company  on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
         Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series M is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series M can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series M from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI",  or the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series M to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series M values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series M's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series M, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  M can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series M's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-Strategy Series M does not take a liquidity discount on
         any  Investment   Funds  held.  The  underlying   investments  of  each
         Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as described in each
         Investment Fund's financial statements. The Investment Funds may invest
         a  portion  of  their  assets  in  restricted   securities   and  other
         investments that are illiquid.

         B.  FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series M's subsequent
         registration  under  the 1933  Act have  been  deferred  and are  being
         amortized over the twelve months commencing after the effective date of
         such registration statement.

         C.  INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series M's taxable income
         or loss.

         D.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A.  account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at
         cost plus accrued interest.

         E.  CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

         Contributions    received   in   advance   of   $1,121,750   represents
         subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts on
         October 1, 2004.  Such amount is largely  represented  within the short
         term investments  balance as depicted in the  accompanying  schedule of
         investments.

         F.  USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series M. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee equal to 0.167%
         (2.00% on an annualized  basis) of end of month Members'  capital.  The
         Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  related  expenses of
         $20,970  to  Multi-Strategy  Series  M  during  the  six  months  ended
         September 30, 2004.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent affiliated with the Adviser, will
         generally  be  entitled  to  receive  a fee from each  investor  in the
         Company  whose  Units  the Agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series  M  Units.  For  the  six  months  ended
         September  30,  2004,   CGM  earned   $226,300  in  placement  fees  on
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M  Units.  Such  fees  are  deducted  from  an
         investor's gross contribution amount.

         Multi-Strategy  Series M pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on an
         annualized basis) for  administration  based primarily upon average net
         assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and will reimburse  certain
         expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  has retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),  an
         independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A.,
         to  assist  in the  performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  PFPC
         provides certain accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.

         Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of Multi-Adviser Hedge
         Fund  Portfolios  LLC,  as defined by the 1940 Act,  receives an annual
         retainer of $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of
         $500. Such Director fees are allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based
         on the  relative  net assets of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an
         "interested  person"  does not  receive  any  annual  or other fee from
         Multi-Adviser  Hedge Fund  Portfolios LLC. All Directors are reimbursed
         for all  reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed
         related  to  Directors  by  Multi-Strategy  Series M for the six months
         ended September 30, 2004 were $5,521.

         PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, N.A.) serves as custodian
         of Multi-Strategy Series M's assets and provides custodial services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and
         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series M.

     5.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  Units  may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional  subscriptions for Units in Multi-Strategy Series M. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  M  to
         repurchase Units from Members pursuant to written tenders by Members on
         such terms and  conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects  that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to  repurchase  Units from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series M for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

     6.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Investment  Funds  in which
         Multi-Strategy Series M invests trade various financial instruments and
         enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk.
         These  include,  but are not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,
         writing option contracts and entering into equity swaps.
