Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.



SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in tax-free investing and a
driving force in fixed income investing around the globe. They also bring
expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Established in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style
of value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.



TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.



RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND PRIMARY INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent possible, through a portfolio consisting
primarily of high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage-
and other asset-backed securities.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's
first semiannual report covering the period from the Fund's commencement of
operations on August 27, 2003, through September 30, 2003.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust posted cumulative total returns
of +1.40% based on net asset value and -0.27% based on market price from the
Fund's commencement of operations on August 27, 2003, through September 30,
2003, as shown in the Performance Summary on page 6. The net asset value rose
from $14.33 per share on August 27, 2003, to $14.53 at period-end, and the
market price decreased from $15.00 to $14.96 over the same period.

Mortgage- & Other Asset-Backed Securities                42.6%
High Yield Corporate Bonds                               39.4%

Short-Term Investments & Other Net Assets                 1.8%


ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Continuing a downward trend that began in 2000, the 10-year Treasury note's
yield fell to 3.11% during June 2003, the lowest level in more than 45 years.
The decline in interest rates had a positive impact on the domestic economy as
lower interest rates allowed both consumers and businesses to transact at
reduced costs. For consumers, historically low mortgage rates enabled many
homeowners to refinance their mortgages, as refinancing applications reached
their highest levels on record. Additionally, rising home values and
refinancings improved many consumers' net worth and allowed them to continue
spending. In fact, retail sales grew 7.5% on a year-over-year basis as of
September 2003, helping to drive overall economic growth.

With regard to businesses, many companies took advantage of the lower interest
rate environment to refinance outstanding debt at more attractive levels,
helping their liquidity and setting the stage for improving overall business
conditions. Moreover, the boom in productivity experienced since 2001 allowed
many companies to achieve greater output per worker, boosting corporate profits.

However, by period-end, yields rose sharply from their June 2003 low, with the
10-year Treasury note ending September 2003 at 3.96%, after reaching an
inter-period high of 4.61% in early September. The rise in intermediate- and
longer-term interest

<PAGE>

rates was driven by a combination of increased optimism for a sustained economic
recovery, which could put upward pressure on the currently benign inflation
level, and the selling of Treasury securities by institutional mortgage
investors as they sought to manage the overall durations, or interest rate
sensitivity, of their portfolios.


INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We seek to maintain a limited duration, or interest rate sensitivity, to
moderate the impact that rising interest rates might have on the Fund's fixed
income portfolio. We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities,
primarily high yield corpo-rate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans,
and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. Our "top-down" analysis of
macroeconomic trends combined with a "bottom-up" fundamental analysis of market
sectors, industries and issuers drives our investment process. Within the
corporate bond and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable
valuations from issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions,
stable cash flows, reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values,
strong sponsorship and improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other
asset-backed securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream
and total return through our proprietary analysis of security prepayment
assumptions, pricing inefficiencies, and underlying collateral characteristics.

The Fund intends to offer preferred shares of beneficial interest representing
approximately 33% of the Fund's total assets. That transaction will give rise to
a form of leverage. By using leverage, we would seek to obtain a higher return
for holders of common shares than if we did not use leverage.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

On September 30, 2003, the Fund had $371.8 million in total net assets. Since
the Fund's commencement of operations on August 27, 2003, we have invested in
three primary asset categories--high yield corporate bonds, senior floating rate
bank loans, and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.

In the high yield sector, a combination of improving credit fundamentals and
declining default rates, a manageable level of new-issue supply, and security
valuations that we believe were reasonable compared with longer-term averages
led to relatively strong returns. We were able to invest in many high yield
issues as the


                                                           Semiannual Report | 3

<PAGE>

period began, and the Fund benefited from a subsequent rise in prices. With high
yield spread levels over Treasury securities of approximately 6 percentage
points at period-end, compared with a 5.9 percentage point 10-year average, and
considering recent improvement in credit fundamentals, high yield bonds
represented 39.4% of the Fund's total net assets on September 30, 2003.

Within the mortgage- and other asset-backed securities sector, we focused our
purchases in areas of the agency mortgage-backed market where we believed
prepayment risk was mispriced, which led us to invest primarily in the 5% to
6.5% coupon range, although we considered higher coupon securities when we saw
value. We also looked to some higher quality mortgage-related securities, as
these securities typically carry a yield premium over their
government-guaranteed counterparts. With the recent decline in interest rates
following July's difficult performance, the mortgage-backed securities market
generally experienced positive total returns since the Fund's late-August
launch. Mortgage- and other asset-backed securities represented 42.6% of the
Fund's total net assets on September 30, 2003.

In the floating rate loan sector, as of period-end, we had purchased or
committed to purchase floating rate loans from 30 different borrowers that met
our fundamental investment criteria. In purchasing securities from this sector,
we found loans in both the primary (new-issue) and secondary markets. Under
normal market conditions, the Fund is expected to have at least 25% of its
assets in each asset category. As of September 30, 2003, 16.2% of the Fund's
total net assets were invested in floating rate securities. Since the date of
this report, proceeds from the Fund's common share offering have been more fully
allocated to the floating rate loan sector.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and
simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions
("Distributions") in shares of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (the "Agent"), P.O. Box
43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the
Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as
your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the



                                                           Semiannual Report | 7

<PAGE>



net asset value of the shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than
if such Distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants
should note that they will not be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares
at a specific time or at a specific price. The Agent may make open-market
purchases on any securities exchange where shares are traded, in the
over-the-counter market or in negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms
as to price, delivery and otherwise as the Agent shall determine.

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American stock exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants of the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distri-bution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

<PAGE>



The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at 1-800/331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (the Fund) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end investment
company. The Fund seeks high current income. The following summarizes the Fund's
significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange or NASDAQ are
valued at the last reported sales price. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the
latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by management in
accordance with procedures established by the Board of Trustees.

The Fund invests in senior secured corporate loans and senior secured debt that
meet credit standards established by Franklin Advisers Inc. The Fund values its
securities based on quotations provided by banks, broker/dealers or pricing
services experienced in such matters.

B. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, OR TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, or to be
announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future date.
These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to the
risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date purchase
price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with the
intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date. Sufficient assets have been segregated for these securities.

C. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its tax-able income.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts and premiums
on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective
securities. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

H. OFFERING COSTS

Offering costs are charged to paid-in-capital upon the sale of Fund shares.

and FT Services of .50% and .20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
net assets, plus the liquidation value of the preferred shares.


4. INCOME TAXES

primarily due to differing treatments of paydown losses, and bond discounts and
premiums.

discounts and premiums.

4. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

At September 30, 2003, net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) based on the
cost of investment for income tax purposes of $404,921,851 was as follows:

Unrealized appreciation ..................................    $5,131,416

5. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of securities (excluding short-term securities) for the
period ended September 30, 2003 aggregated $373,256,348 and $12,597,173,
respectively.


6. INVESTMENTS IN THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund. The Fund earned $46,709 of dividend income from investment in
the Sweep Money Fund for the period ended September 30, 2003.


7. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

The Fund has 47.3% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities may be unsecured and
subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or securities for which income has been
deemed uncollectible. The Fund discontinues accruing income on these securities
and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable. At September 30,
2003, the value of these securities was $3,145,000 representing .85% of the
Fund's net assets. For information as to specific securities, see the
accompanying Statement of Investments.

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On October 14, 2003, the Fund issued 960,000 shares in connection with the final
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment allocation option. Shares were
issued at $15.00 per share, resulting in a $14,400,000 prior to the deduction of
$648,000 for the underwriter discount. Total proceeds received by the Fund were
$13,752,000.

On October 20, 2003, the Board of Trustees indicated its intention to authorize
the issuance of preferred shares of beneficial interest representing
approximately 33%, but not more than 38%, of the Fund's total net assets. The
preferred shares will have voting rights and rank senior to the Fund's common
shares.

Upon the issuance of the preferred shares, the Fund will be required to maintain
on a weekly basis a specified discounted value for its portfolio in compliance
with guidelines established by Moody's Investor Services Inc. and Fitch Ratings,
and is required to maintain asset coverage for the preferred shares of at least
200%.

Offering costs incurred in connection with the preferred shares are estimated to
be 1.2% of the offering amount and will be charged to paid-in-capital upon the
issuance of the preferred shares.

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE
      This code of ethics (the "Code")1 is for the investment companies within
the complex registered with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

o     Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
      other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

o     Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
      appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
      Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his
service to, the FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the FT Funds.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.
Each Covered Officer must:

o     Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
      whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
      the FT Funds;

o     Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      the FT Funds;

o     Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
      Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
      are made in good faith;

o     Report  at  least   annually   the   following   affiliations   or  other
      relationships:/2

o     all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
      required to file reports with the SEC;
o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
      directors;

o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
      accounting firm; and

o     any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
      that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
      the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
      affiliates of Franklin Resources).

   There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3:

  o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

  o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

  o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT
    Funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such
    entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
    time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
    impropriety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must
    obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of
    $1000.

  o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
    adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
    thereof;

  o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
    charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
    transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
    arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

    FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
      outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
      and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
      the adviser and the administrator with the goal of promoting full, fair,
      accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
      documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
      public communications made by the FT Funds; and

o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
      with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
      regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY
 Each Covered Officer must:

o     Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
      read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);
o     Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
      requirements of the Code; and

o     Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he knows
      of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself is a violation
      of this Code.

      FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.4
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

      The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

o     FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
      action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;
o     If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy General
      Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, FT's General Counsel is
      not required to take any further action;
o     Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
      a violation will be reported to the Independent Directors of the
      appropriate FT Fund;
o     If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it will
      inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate Funds,
      which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
      appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
      notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
      board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;
o     The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
      appropriate; and
o     Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS
      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY
      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE
      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

TO:   FT GENERAL COUNSEL, LEGAL DEPARTMENT
I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of Franklin Templeton Fund's code of
ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers (the
"Code") that I have read and understand. I will comply fully with all provisions
of the Code to the extent they apply to me during the period of my employment. I
further understand and acknowledge that any violation of the Code may subject me
to disciplinary action, including termination of employment

                Signature                           Date signed

1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report;
(2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or
(3) undertake in its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in
which such request may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to,
or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the
registrant's annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such information on its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

2 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing the Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel. 3 Any activity or relationship that
would present a conflict for a Covered
  Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a
  member of the Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity
  or has such a relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written
  approval by FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
  a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
  waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
  action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from
  a provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
  officer" of the registrant.

reporting that occurred  during the  registrant's  most recent fiscal  half-year

has  materially  affected,  or is reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5. The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s)  and I have disclosed to the
registrant's  auditors  and the audit  committee  of the  registrant's  board of

deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the design or  operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the registrant's  ability to record,  process,  summarize,  and report financial
information;  and  (b)  Any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves
management or other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
internal control over financial reporting.
