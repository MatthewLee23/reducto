    Company not incurred these fees, the ratio of expenses to average Shareholders capital and the ratio of net investment loss to
    average Shareholders capital would have been 1.99% and (1.98)% for the year end 2010, 2.30% and (2.29)% for the year end 2009
    and 2.40% and (2.37)% for the year ended 2008, respectively. There were no subscription or redemption fees for the years ended

1.   ORGANIZATION

     SkyBridge  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the "Company") (formerly Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser
     Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC) was organized as a Delaware Limited  Liability Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered
     under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended, as a closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
     company. The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act").

     The investment  objective of the Company is to achieve capital  appreciation  principally through investing in investment funds
     ("Investment Funds") managed by third-party  investment managers  ("Investment  Managers") that employ a variety of alternative
     investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies  allow Investment  Managers the flexibility to use leverage or short-side
     positions  to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies  across the global  markets,  often  referred to as  "alternative"
     strategies.  Because  Investment  Funds following  alternative  investment  strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the
     investment program of the Company can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

     Shares of the Company ("Shares") are sold to eligible investors (referred to as "Shareholders"). The minimum initial investment
     in the Company from each Shareholder is $25,000; the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

     SkyBridge Capital II, LLC (the "Adviser"),  a Delaware limited liability company,  serves as the Company's  investment adviser.
     The Adviser is registered as an investment  adviser under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and,  among other
     things, is responsible for the allocation of the Company's assets to various  Investment Funds.  Under the Company's  governing
     documents,  the Company has delegated substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations and assets of the
     Company to the Board of Directors.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
     America ("GAAP") and are expressed in United States dollars. The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting
     policies used in preparing the financial statements.

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms of the respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability
     company  agreements,  offering  memoranda and such  negotiated  "side letter" or similar  arrangements  as the Adviser may have
     entered into with the Investment Fund on behalf of the Company.  The Company's  investments in the Investment Funds are carried
     at fair value as determined by the Company's pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund.


                                                                - 8 -

<TABLE>

SKYBRIDGE MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC
(FORMERLY CITIGROUP ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     All valuations  utilize  financial  information  supplied by each  Investment  Fund and are net of management  and  performance
     incentive fees or other allocations  payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment Funds' agreements.
     Each  Investment  Manager to which the  Adviser  allocates  assets  will charge the  Company,  as an investor in an  underlying
     Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in
     the form of an incentive fee. The  asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3%
     annually of the net assets under their  management and the incentive fee is generally  expected to range from 15% to 25% of net
     profits  annually.  These management and incentive fees are accounted for in the valuations of the Investment Funds and are not
     included in the management fees reflected in the Statement of Operations.

     The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate  certain  investments  within those Investment  Funds,  typically
     those that are especially illiquid and/or hard to value, as "special situation" (often called  "Side-Pocket")  investments with
     additional  redemption  limitations.  Such a  Side-Pocket  is, in effect,  similar to a private  equity fund that  requires its
     investors to remain invested for the duration of the fund and distributes returns on the investment only when liquid assets are
     generated within the fund, typically through the sale of the fund's illiquid assets in exchange for cash.

     As a general  matter,  the fair value of the Company's  investment in an Investment Fund represents the amount that the Company
     can reasonably expect to receive if the Company's  investment was sold in an orderly transaction at the time of valuation.  The
     Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance
     notice of a shareholder's intent to redeem its interest, and may, depending on the Investment Funds' governing agreements, deny
     or delay a redemption request. The Company considers whether a liquidity discount on any Investment Fund should be taken due to
     redemption  restrictions or suspensions by the Investment  Fund.  However,  the effects of any discounts  related to redemption
     restrictions  or lock-up periods were determined by the Adviser to be  insignificant  at September 30, 2010, and therefore,  no
     discounts  were applied to the fair value of the Investment  Funds.  The underlying  investments  of each  Investment  Fund are
     accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  The Investment  Funds may invest a
     portion of their assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid.

     B.   NET ASSET VALUE DETERMINATION

     The net asset value of the Company is determined  as of the close of business at the end of each month in  accordance  with the
     valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of
     Directors.

     Retroactive  adjustments  to the Company's  net asset value might be made after the  valuation  date which could impact the net
     asset value per share at which Shareholders  purchase or sell Company Shares. The valuations  reported by the Investment Funds,
     upon which the Company calculates its month end net asset value, may be subject to adjustment subsequent to the valuation date,
     based on information which becomes available after that valuation date. For example, fiscal year-end net


                                                                - 9 -

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     asset values of an Investment Fund may be revised as a result of a year-end audit performed by the independent auditors of that
     Investment  Fund.  Other  adjustments  to the  Company's  net asset  value may also occur  from time to time,  such as from the
     misapplication by the Company or its agents of the valuation policies described in the Company's valuation procedures.

     Retroactive  adjustments to the Company's net asset value, which are caused by adjustments to the Investment Funds values or by
     a misapplication of the Company's valuation policies, that are able to be made within 90 days of the valuation date(s) to which
     the  adjustment  would apply will be made  automatically  unless  determined  to be de  minimis.  Other  potential  retroactive
     adjustments, regardless of whether their impact increases or decreases the Company's net asset value, will be made only if they
     both (i) are caused by a misapplication  of the Company's  valuation  policies and (ii) deemed to be material.  All retroactive
     adjustments are reported to the Company's Valuation Committee and to affected Shareholders.

     The  Company  follows a policy  which  permits  revisions  to the number of Shares  purchased  or sold by  Shareholders  due to
     retroactive  adjustments  made under the  circumstances  described  above which occur within 90 days of the valuation  date. In
     circumstances where a retroactive  adjustment is not made under the circumstances  described above, Shares purchased or sold by
     Shareholders  will not be adjusted.  As a result,  to the extent that the subsequent impact of the event which was not adjusted
     adversely  affects the Company's net asset value,  the  outstanding  Shares of the Company will be adversely  affected by prior
     repurchases  made at a net asset value per Share higher than the adjusted value.  Conversely,  any increases in net asset value
     per Share resulting from such subsequent impact will be to the benefit of the holders of the outstanding  Shares of the Company
     and to the detriment of Shareholders who previously had their Shares  repurchased at a net asset value per Share lower than the
     post-impact  value.  New  Shareholders  may be affected in a similar way,  because the same principles apply to the purchase of
     Shares.

     C.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

     Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis as earned. Expenses are recognized as incurred. Income, expenses and realized
     and unrealized gains and losses are recorded monthly.

     The change in an  Investment  Fund's net asset  value is  included  in net change in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on
     investments  in Investment  Funds on the Statement of  Operations.  During the six month period ended  September 30, 2010,  the
     Company accounted for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value
     and cost of the underlying  investment at the date of redemption.  Previously,  the Company  utilized the cost recovery method.
     This  retroactive  change in  presentation  resulted in an increase in cost in the amount of  $5,624,268  through a decrease in
     unrealized  appreciation  and a  corresponding  increase  in  realized  gain at March 31,  2010.  The change did not affect the
     Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     The Company bears all expenses  incurred in the course of its  operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all
     costs and expenses related to portfolio transactions and positions for the


                                                               - 10 -

     Company's  account;  professional  fees; costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  and expenses of meetings of the Board of
     Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company became a corporation  that is taxed as a regulated  investment  company  ("RIC') as of October 1, 2005. The Company
     operated as a partnership from inception through September 30, 2005.

     It is the  Company's  intention  to meet the  requirements  of the  Internal  Revenue Code  applicable  to RICs and  distribute
     substantially  all of its taxable net investment  income and capital gains, if any, to Shareholders  each year.  Therefore,  no
     federal  income or excise tax  provision is required  for the  Company's  financial  statements.  While the Company  intends to
     distribute  substantially  all of its taxable  net  investment  income and  capital  gains,  in the manner  necessary  to avoid
     imposition of the 4% excise tax as described  above, it is possible that some excise tax will be incurred.  In such event,  the
     Company will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirements. During
     the six month period ended September 30, 2010, the Company  incurred  $189,591 of excise tax which is recognized as a component
     of miscellaneous expenses on the Statement of Operations.  This expense was attributable to the Company not distributing 98% of
     its income during the March 31, 2010 tax year end.

     The Company has analyzed tax  positions  taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing  the Company's tax return for
     all open tax years and has concluded,  as of September 30, 2010, no provision for income tax would be required in the Company's
     financial  statements.  The  Company's  federal  and state  income and  federal  excise tax returns for tax years for which the
     applicable  statutes of  limitations  have not expired are subject to  examination  by the Internal  Revenue  Service and state
     departments of revenue.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties,  if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income
     tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the six month period ended September 30, 2010, the Company did not incur any
     interest or penalties.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of cash on deposit and monies invested in money market deposit  accounts that are accounted
     for at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Such cash, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has
     not  experienced  any losses in such  accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any  significant  credit risk on such bank
     deposits.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with GAAP  requires  management of the Company to make  estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Changes in the economic
     environment,  financial  markets,  and any other  parameters used in determining  these estimates could cause actual results to
     differ materially.

     Certain amounts have been reclassified from the prior year's information to conform to the current year's presentation.

     G.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued  Accounting  Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-06 which
     requires new  disclosures and provides  amendments to Accounting  Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  Subtopic 820-10  clarifying
     existing  disclosures.  The disclosure regarding the Level 3 investment  rollforward of purchases and sales activity on a gross
     basis is effective for fiscal years beginning  after December 15, 2010. The Company is currently  evaluating the impact of this
     disclosure on its financial statements.

3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

     In accordance with the authoritative  guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures under GAAP, the Company discloses the
     fair value of its  investments  in a hierarchy that  prioritizes  the inputs to valuation  techniques  used to measure the fair
     value.  The  hierarchy  gives the highest  priority to valuations  based upon  unadjusted  quoted prices in active  markets for
     identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that
     are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurement). The guidance establishes three levels of fair value as listed below.

     Level 1- Inputs that reflect  unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities that the Company
     has the ability to access at the measurement date;

     Level 2- Inputs  other than  quoted  prices that are  observable  for the asset or  liability  either  directly or  indirectly,
     including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active;

     Level 3- Inputs that are unobservable.

     The notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the
     asset or liability at the measurement  date.  Under Level 3, the owner of an asset must determine  valuation based on their own
     assumptions about what market  participants  would take into account in determining the fair value of the asset, using the best
     information available.

     The inputs or methodology  used for valuing  securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing
     in those securities.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategies,  their liquidity and redemption notice periods and any restrictions on
     the liquidity provisions of the investments in Investment Funds held by the Company as of September 30, 2010.  Investment Funds
     with no current redemption restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions, in accordance
     with their offering documents which, in accordance with ASU 2009-12,  would affect its disclosure.  The Company had no unfunded
     capital commitments as of September 30, 2010.

     Directional equity funds take long and short stock positions.  The manager may attempt to profit from both long and short stock
     positions  independently,  or profit from the relative  outperformance  of long positions  against short  positions.  The stock
     picking and portfolio  construction  process is usually based on bottom-up  fundamental  stock  analysis,  but may also include
     top-down  macro-based views,  market trends and sentiment factors.  Directional equity managers may specialize by region (e.g.,
     global,  U.S.,  Europe or Japan) or by sector.  No assurance  can be given that the managers  will be able to correctly  locate
     profitable trading  opportunities,  and such  opportunities may be adversely affected by unforeseen events. In addition,  short
     selling  creates the risk of loss if the security that has been sold short  appreciates in value.  The Investment  Funds within
     this strategy have monthly to quarterly  liquidity,  and are generally subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period.  One Investment
     Fund in this strategy,  representing  approximately 1 percent in this strategy, is an illiquid side pocket investment,  and has
     suspended redemptions.  The remaining approximately 99 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy can be redeemed with no
     restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Directional  macro  strategies  require well developed risk management  procedures due to the frequent  employment of leverage.
     Investment managers may trade futures,  options on future contracts and foreign exchange contracts and may trade in diversified
     markets or focus on one market sector.  Two types of strategies  employed by directional  macro managers are  DISCRETIONARY and
     SYSTEMATIC  trading.  Discretionary  trading strategies seek to dynamically  allocate capital to relatively  short-term trading
     opportunities around the world.  Directional  strategies (seeking to participate in rising and declining when the trend appears
     strong and justified by fundamentals) and relative value approaches (establishing long positions in undervalued instruments and
     short positions in related instruments believed to be over valued) or in "spread" positions in an attempt to capture changes in
     the relationships  between instruments.  Systematic trading strategies generally rely on computerized trading systems or models
     to identify and capitalize on trends in financial and commodity markets. This systematic approach allows investment managers to
     seek to take  advantage of price  patterns in very large number of markets.  The trading  models may be focused on technical or
     fundamental  factors or combination of factors.  Generally,  the Investment Funds within this strategy have monthly  liquidity,
     subject to a 5 to 90 day  notice  period.  Investment  Funds in this  strategy,  representing  approximately  2 percent in this
     strategy,  are illiquid side pocket  investments  with suspended  redemptions.  The remaining  approximately  98 percent of the
     Investment  Funds in this strategy can be redeemed with no restrictions  as of the measurement  date, and so, are classified as
     Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Event driven  strategies  involve  investing in opportunities  created by significant  transactional  events such as spin-offs,
     mergers and  acquisitions,  bankruptcies,  recapitalizations  and share  buybacks.  Event  driven  strategies  include  "merger
     arbitrage" and "distressed securities".  Generally, the Investment Funds within this strategy have monthly to annual liquidity,
     subject to a 30 to 180 day notice period.  Investment  Funds in this  strategy,  representing  approximately  3 percent in this
     strategy, are illiquid side pocket investments with suspended  redemptions.  Approximately 5 percent of the Investment Funds in
     this strategy have gated redemptions,  which are expected to be lifted within 12 months. In addition,  approximately 11 percent
     of the Investment  Funds in this strategy are classified as Level 3 investments  due to liquidity  provisions on a greater than
     quarterly basis. The

     remaining  approximately  81 percent of the Investment  Funds in this strategy can be redeemed with no  restrictions  as of the
     measurement date, and so, are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Relative value  arbitrage  strategies  seek to take  advantage of specific  pricing  anomalies,  while also seeking to maintain
     minimal  exposure to  systematic  market  risk.  This may be achieved by  purchasing  one  security  previously  believed to be
     undervalued,  while selling short another  security  perceived to be overvalued.  Relative value arbitrage  strategies  include
     equity market neutral,  statistical  arbitrage,  convertible  arbitrage,  and fixed income arbitrage.  Some investment managers
     classified as multi-strategy relative value arbitrage use a combination of these substrategies. Generally, the Investment Funds
     within this strategy have monthly to quarterly  liquidity,  subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period.  Investment  Funds in this
     strategy,  representing  approximately  2 percent in this  strategy,  are  illiquid  side  pocket  investments  with  suspended
     redemptions.  The  remaining  approximately  98  percent of the  Investment  Funds in this  strategy  can be  redeemed  with no
     restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     The Company follows the  authoritative  guidance under GAAP on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for
     the asset or liability have  significantly  decreased and identifying  transactions that are not orderly.  Accordingly,  if the
     Company determines that either the volume and/or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly  decreased (from
     normal  conditions  for that asset or liability)  or price  quotations or  observable  inputs are not  associated  with orderly
     transactions,  increased analysis and management judgment will be required to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques such as
     an income approach might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market approach in those circumstances.

     The guidance also provides a list of factors to determine  whether there has been a significant  decrease in relation to normal
     market activity. Regardless,  however, of the valuation technique and inputs used, the objective for the fair value measurement
     in those  circumstances  is  unchanged  from what it would be if  markets  were  operating  at normal  activity  levels  and/or
     transactions were orderly; that is, to determine the current exit price.

     A financial  instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is significant
     to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes "observable" requires significant judgment by the
     Adviser. The Adviser considers observable data to be market data which is readily available,  regularly distributed or updated,
     reliable and  verifiable,  not  proprietary,  and provided by  independent  sources that are actively  involved in the relevant
     market.

     Placement  agents may be retained by the Company to assist in the placement of the  Company's  Shares.  A placement  agent will
     generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor in the Company whose Shares the agent places.  The specific amount of
     the placement fee paid with respect to a Shareholder is generally dependent on the size of the investment in the Company.

     The Company has entered into  agreements  with third parties to act as additional  placement  agents for the Company's  Shares.
     Placement fees may range from 0 to 3%. In addition to the placement fee paid by Shareholders, the Adviser and/or its affiliates

     The Company's  officers are appointed by the  Directors and oversee the  management of the day-today  operations of the Company
     under the  supervision  of the Board of Directors.  One of the Directors and all of the officers of the Company are  directors,
     officers or  employees of the Adviser or its  subsidiaries.  The other  Directors  are not  affiliated  with the Adviser or its
     subsidiaries and are not "interested persons" as defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "Independent  Directors").
     The  Directors  and  officers of the Company also may be directors  and  officers of other  investment  companies or managed or
     advised by SkyBridge or its  subsidiaries.  A list of the Directors and officers of the Company and a brief  statement of their
     present positions,  principal occupations and directorships during the past five years are set out below. To the fullest extent
     allowed by applicable  law,  including the 1940 Act, the LLC  Agreement  indemnifies  the Directors and officers for all costs,
     liabilities and expenses that they may experience as a result of their service as such.

     Certain of the Directors and officers of the Company are also directors and/or officers of other investment  companies that are
     advised by the Adviser. (The Company and such other investment  companies,  if also registered under the 1940 Act, are referred
     to collectively in the Prospectus as the "Fund Complex.").  The address for each Director and officer in his or her capacity as
     such is 527 Madison Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10022.

Shareholders.

In addition to his role as Independent Director of the Company,  Steven Krull serves on a special independent committee representing
clients of Citigroup Alternative Investments,  LLC, the Fund's predecessor investment adviser ("CAI"). The committee engagements and
