* Not annualized.

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when sold, may be worth more or
less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information
current to the most recent month-end by visiting seligman.com. J. & W. Seligman
& Co. Incorporated, former investment manager of the Fund, made certain payments
to the Fund in 2004. Absent such payments, the net asset value returns that
include this period would have been lower.

Returns reflect changes in market price or net asset value, as applicable, and
assume reinvestment of distributions. Returns do not reflect the deduction of
taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares.

The index and the averages do not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses
(excluding Lipper) and taxes. It is not possible to invest directly in an index
or an average.

(1) The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&P 500 Index), an
    unmanaged index of common stocks, is frequently used as a general measure of
    market performance. The index reflects reinvestment of all distributions and
    changes in market prices.
(2) The Lipper Closed-End Core Funds Average measures the performance of closed-
    end funds. The average reflects reinvestment of all distributions and
    changes in market prices.
(3) The Lipper Large-Cap Core Funds Average includes open-end funds that, by
    portfolio practice, invest at least 75% of their assets in companies with
    market capitalizations (on a three-year weighted basis) above Lipper's U.S.
    Diversified Equity large-cap floor. Large-cap core funds typically have an
    average price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-
    per-share growth value relative to the S&P 500 Index. The average reflects
    reinvestment of all distributions and changes in market prices. The Lipper
    Large-Cap Core Funds Average is provided for comparative purposes so that
    the Fund's performance can be measured against both closed-end and open-end
    funds with similar portfolio holdings as the Fund. Lipper classifies the
    Fund, based on its portfolio holdings, as a Closed-End Core Fund.

The net asset value of the Fund's shares may not always correspond to the market
price of such shares. Common stock of many closed-end funds frequently trade at
a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is subject to stock market risk,
which is the risk that stock prices overall will decline over short or long
periods, adversely affecting the value of an investment in the Fund.

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS (continued) -------------------------------------------

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS


Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157) requires
disclosure regarding the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair
value and any changes in valuation inputs or techniques. In addition,
investments shall be disclosed by major category.

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair
value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by prioritizing that the most observable input be used when
available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in
pricing an investment based on market data obtained from sources independent of
the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are those that reflect the Fund's
assumptions about the information market participants would use in pricing an
investment. An investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of any input that is deemed significant to the asset or
liability's fair value measurement. When a valuation uses multiple inputs from
varying levels of the hierarchy, the hierarchy level is determined based on the
lowest level input or inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The input levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk
or liquidity associated with investments at that level. For example, certain
U.S. government securities are generally high quality and liquid, however, they
are reflected as Level 2 because the inputs used to determine fair value may not
always be quoted prices in an active market.

Fair value inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:

     - Level 1 -- Valuations based on quoted prices for investments in active
       markets that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date.
       Valuation adjustments are not applied to Level 1 investments.

     - Level 2 -- Valuations based on other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.).

     - Level 3 -- Valuations based on significant unobservable inputs (including
       the Fund's own assumptions and judgment in determining the fair value of
       investments).

Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an investment may include
price information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. These
inputs can be either observable or unobservable. The availability of observable
inputs can vary between investments, and is affected by various factors such as
the type of investment, and the volume and level of activity for that investment
or similar investments in the marketplace. The inputs will be considered by the
Fund Administrator, along with any other relevant factors in the calculation of
an investment's fair value. The Fund uses prices and inputs that are current as
of the measurement date, which may include periods of market dislocations.
During these periods, the availability of prices and inputs may be reduced for
many investments. This condition could cause an investment to be reclassified
between the various levels within the hierarchy.

Non-U.S. equity securities actively traded in foreign markets may be reflected
in Level 2 despite the availability of closing prices, because the Fund
evaluates and determines whether those closing prices reflect fair value at the
close of the NYSE or require adjustment, as described in Note 2 to the financial
statements -- Valuation of securities.

Investments falling into the Level 3 category are primarily supported by quoted
prices from brokers and dealers participating in the market for those
investments. However, these may be classified as

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12  TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)




Level 3 investments due to lack of market transparency and corroboration to
support these quoted prices. Additionally, valuation models may be used as the
pricing source for any remaining investments classified as Level 3. These models
rely on one or more significant unobservable inputs and/or significant
assumptions by the Fund Administrator. Inputs used in a valuation model may
include, but are not limited to, financial statement analysis, discount rates
and estimated cash flows, and comparable company data.

The following table is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's
investments as of June 30, 2009:

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS -----------------------------------------------------------

Per share operating performance data is designed to allow investors to trace the
operating performance, on a per Common shares basis, from the beginning net
asset value to the ending net asset value, so that investors can understand what
effect the individual items have on their investment, assuming it was held
throughout the period. Generally, the per share amounts are derived by
converting the actual dollar amounts incurred for each item, as disclosed in the
financial statements, to their equivalent per Common share amounts, using
average shares outstanding during the period.

Total investment return measures the Fund's performance assuming that investors
purchased shares of the Fund at the market value or net asset value as of the
beginning of the period, invested all distributions paid, as provided for in the
Fund's Prospectus and Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Purchase Plan, and
then sold their shares at the closing market value or net asset value per share
on the last day of the period. The computations do not reflect any sales charges
or transaction costs on your investment or taxes investors may incur on
distributions or on the sale of shares of the Fund, and are not annualized for
periods of less than one year.

The ratios of expenses and net investment income to average net investment
assets and to average net assets for Common Stock for the periods presented do
not reflect the effect of dividends paid to Preferred Stockholders.

    reimbursement, total return would have been lower by 0.48%.
(c) Excluding the effect of the payments received from the Fund's predecessor
    investment manager in 2004, the total investment return would have been
    13.33%.
(d) Adjusted to an annual basis. The Non-Recurring Charges (see Note 4 to the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED AS OF JUNE 30, 2009)

1. ORGANIZATION

Tri-Continental Corporation (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act) as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The Fund has 1 million authorized shares of
preferred capital stock and 159 million authorized shares of common stock which
trades primarily on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "TY".

The Fund invests primarily for the longer term and its objective is to produce
future growth of both capital and income while providing reasonable current
income.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES
Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,
liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.

VALUATION OF SECURITIES
All securities are valued at the close of business of the NYSE. Securities
traded on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems
are valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded
in the over-the-counter market and are valued by an independent pricing service
using an evaluated bid. When market quotes are not readily available, the
pricing service, in determining fair values of debt securities, takes into
consideration such factors as current quotations by broker/dealers, coupon,
maturity, quality, type of issue, trading characteristics, and other yield and
risk factors it deems relevant in determining valuations. Foreign securities are
valued based on quotations from the principal market in which such securities
are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board of Directors (the
Board) generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close
of the NYSE and therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or
on

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22  TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the NYSE, including significant movements in the U.S. market
after foreign exchanges have closed. Accordingly, in those situations,
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial), parent company of RiverSource
Investments, LLC (RiverSource Investments or the Investment Manager), as
administrator to the Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to
procedures adopted by the Board, including utilizing a third party pricing
service to determine these fair values. These procedures take into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. securities markets, to
determine a good faith estimate that reasonably reflects the current market
conditions as of the close of the NYSE.

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates. Typically, those maturing in 60 days or less that originally had
maturities of more than 60 days at acquisition date are valued at amortized cost
using the market value on the 61(st) day before maturity. Short-term securities
maturing in 60 days or less at acquisition date are valued at amortized cost.
Amortized cost is an approximation of market value. Investments in money market
funds are valued at net asset value.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized
between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other
translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign
withholding taxes.

ILLIQUID SECURITIES
At June 30, 2009, investments in securities included issues that are illiquid
which the Fund currently limits to 15% of net assets, at market value, at the
time of purchase. The aggregate value of such securities at June 30, 2009 was
$4,898,405 representing 0.60% of net assets. Certain illiquid securities may be
valued by management at fair value according to procedures approved, in good
faith, by the Board. According to Board guidelines, certain unregistered
securities are determined to be liquid and are not included within the 15%
limitation specified

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT  23

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) --------------------------------------

above. Assets are liquid if they can be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the
asset is valued by the Fund.

PAYMENT FROM THE INVESTMENT MANAGER
During the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Investment Manager voluntarily
reimbursed the Fund $3,120,206 for a loss on a trading error.

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.

FEDERAL TAXES
The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially
all of its taxable income (which includes net short-term capital gains) to
Stockholders. No provision for income or excise taxes is thus required.

Management of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax
positions that would require recognition in the financial statements. Generally,
the tax authorities can examine all the tax returns filed for the last three
years.

DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS
Effective Jan. 8, 2009, the Fund adopted an earned distribution policy. Under
this policy, the Fund intends to make distributions to holders of Common Stock
that are approximately equal to net investment income, less dividends payable on
the Fund's Preferred Stock. Capital gains, when available, are distributed to
Common Stockholders along with the last income dividend of the calendar year.

Prior to Jan. 8, 2009, the Fund had a level rate distribution policy which
called for quarterly distributions to holders of Common Stock equal to 2.75% of
the net asset value attributable to a share of the Fund's Common Stock on the
last business day of the preceding calendar quarter (or approximately 11%
annually) consisting of distributions of income and one or both of net realized
capital gains and returns of capital.

Dividends and other distributions to Stockholders are recorded on ex-dividend
dates.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24  TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OTHER
Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or
sold. Dividends receivable are recognized on ex-dividend dates, except that
certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend dates may have
passed are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the dividend. Interest
income, including amortization of premium, market discount and original issue
discount using the effective interest method, is accrued daily.

3. INVESTMENTS IN DERIVATIVES

The Fund may invest in certain derivative instruments, which are transactions
whose values depend on or are derived from (in whole or in part) the value of
one or more other assets, such as securities, currencies, commodities or
indices. Such derivative instruments may be used to maintain cash reserves while
maintaining exposure to certain other assets, to offset anticipated declines in
values of investments, to facilitate trading, to reduce transaction costs, and
to pursue higher investment returns. The Fund may also use derivative
instruments to mitigate certain investment risks, such as foreign currency
exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS
The Fund may buy and sell financial futures contracts traded on any U.S. or
foreign exchange to produce incremental earnings, hedge existing positions or
protect against market changes in the value of equities, interest rates or
foreign currencies. The Fund may also buy and write put and call options on
these futures contracts. A futures contract represents a commitment for the
future purchase or sale of an asset at a specified price on a specified date.

Futures and options on futures are valued daily based upon the last sale price
at the close of the market on the principal exchange on which they are traded.
Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit either
cash or securities in an amount (initial margin) equal to a certain percentage
of the contract value. Subsequent payments (variation margin) are made or
received by the Fund each day. The variation margin payments are equal to the
daily changes in the contract value and are recorded as unrealized gains and
losses. The Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed
or expires.

Upon entering into futures contracts, the Fund bears the risk of interest rates,
exchange rates or securities prices moving unexpectedly, in which case, the Fund
may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the futures contracts and may
realize a loss. Additional risks include counterparty credit risk, the
possibility of an illiquid market, and that a change in the value of the
contract or option may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying
securities. The gross

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT  25

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) --------------------------------------


notional amount of long contracts was $10.5 million at June 30, 2009. The fair
value of such contracts on June 30, 2009 is set forth in the table below.

OPTION TRANSACTIONS
The Fund may buy and write options traded on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in
the over-the-counter (OTC) market to produce incremental earnings, protect
gains, and facilitate buying and selling of securities for investments. The Fund
may also buy and sell put and call options and write covered call options on
portfolio securities. Options are contracts which entitle the holder to purchase
or sell securities or other financial instruments at a specified price, or in
the case of index options, to receive or pay the difference between the index
value and the strike price of the index option. Completion of transactions for
options traded in the OTC market depends upon the performance of the other
party. Cash collateral may be collected or posted by the Fund to secure certain
OTC options trades. Cash collateral held or posted by the Fund for such option
trades must be returned to the counterparty or the Fund upon closure, exercise
or expiration of the contract.

Option contracts purchased are recorded as investments and options contracts
written are recorded as liabilities of the Fund. Option contracts are valued
daily at the closing prices on their primary exchanges and unrealized
appreciation or depreciation is recorded. Option contracts, including OTC option
contracts, with no readily available market value are valued using quotations
obtained from independent brokers as of the close of the NYSE. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or is exercised. When
options on debt securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a
gain or loss. When other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a
written call option, the purchase cost for a written put option or the cost of a
security for a purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium
received or paid.

The risk in buying an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the
option is exercised. The Fund also has the additional risk of being unable to
enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not exist.
The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for
profit if the market price of the security increases. The risk in writing a put
option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the security
decreases and the option is exercised. The Fund's maximum payout in the case of
written put option contracts represents the maximum potential amount of future
payments (undiscounted) that the Fund could be required to make as a guarantor
for written put options. For OTC options contracts, the transaction is also
subject to counterparty credit risk. The maximum payout amount may be offset by
the subsequent sale, if any, of assets obtained upon the exercise of the put
options by

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



holders of the option contracts or proceeds received upon entering into the
contracts. At June 30, 2009, the Fund had no outstanding written or purchased
options.

4. EXPENSES

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES
Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager
determines on behalf of the Fund which securities will be purchased, held or
sold. Effective June 15, 2009, the management fee charged by the Investment
Manager is 0.355% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Prior to June 15,
2009, the Investment Manager received a fee equal to 0.40% of the Fund's average
daily net assets. The management fee for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was
0.40% of the Fund's average daily net assets. The reduction in the investment
management services fee on June 15, 2009 is related to the elimination of the
administrative portion of the management fee that is now being charged
separately to the Fund through the Administrative Services Agreement with
Ameriprise Financial. See Administrative services fees below for more
information.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES
Under an Administrative Services Agreement, effective June 15, 2009, the Fund
pays Ameriprise Financial a fee for administration and accounting services equal
to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.06%
to 0.03% annually as the Fund's net assets increase. The administrative services
fee was 0.01% of the Fund's average daily net assets for the six months ended
June 30, 2009 (annualized). Prior to June 15, 2009, Ameriprise Financial
administered certain aspects of the Fund's business and other affairs for no
additional fee. The fees payable under the Administrative Services Agreement
beginning on June 15, 2009 are offset by corresponding decreases in the
investment management fees charged to the Fund and the elimination of separate
fees that were previously payable to State Street Bank and Trust Company, in its
capacity as the Fund's prior administrative agent.

OTHER FEES
Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited
administrative services to the Fund and the Board. For the six months ended June
30, 2009, other expenses paid to this company were $3,873.

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS
Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), the board members who are not
"interested persons" of the Fund under the 1940 Act may defer receipt of their
compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts
had been invested in shares of the Fund or other funds in the RiverSource Family


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28  TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


of Funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market value
changes and remains in the Fund until distributed in accordance with the Plan.

STOCKHOLDER SERVICING FEES
Under a Stockholder Service Agent Agreement, RiverSource Service Corporation
(the Stockholder Servicing Agent) maintains Fund Stockholder accounts and
records and provides Fund Stockholder services. Effective June 15, 2009, the
Fund pays the Stockholder Servicing Agent a fee equal to 0.10% of the average
daily net assets of the Fund's shares of Common Stock.

Prior to June 15, 2009, Seligman Data Corp. (SDC), owned by six associated
investment companies, including the Fund, provided Stockholder servicing and
transfer agency services to the Fund, as well as certain other Seligman funds.
The Fund's ownership interest in SDC at June 30, 2009 is included in other
assets in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities at a cost of $43,681. In
January 2009, the Board approved the Fund's termination of the Stockholder
account servicing and transfer agency relationship with SDC, and the engagement
of RiverSource Service Corporation to provide Stockholder account and transfer
agency services. As a result of the Board's termination of the Stockholder
servicing and transfer agency relationship with SDC (which was SDC's sole
business), SDC has exited the Stockholder servicing and transfer agent business,
effective June 15, 2009.

For the period from Jan. 1, 2009 to June 15, 2009, SDC charged the Fund $915,850
for Stockholder account and transfer agency services in accordance with a
methodology approved by the Fund's Board.

In connection with the termination of the Fund's relationship with SDC, the Fund
incurred certain non-recurring charges, including charges relating to SDC's
leases (the Non-Recurring Charges). These Non-Recurring Charges were incurred
over a period from Jan. 28, 2009 to June 12, 2009, and amounted to $1,174,205,
or 0.16% of the Fund's average daily net assets for the six months ended June
30, 2009 (not annualized). These Non-Recurring Charges are included in the
Stockholder servicing and transfer agency fees in the Statement of Operations.
The liability remaining at June 30, 2009 for the Non-Recurring Charges amounted
to $935,293 and is included in the accrued Stockholder servicing and transfer
agency fees in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

The Fund and certain other associated investment companies (together, the
Guarantors) have severally but not jointly guaranteed the performance and
observance of all the terms and conditions of a lease entered into by SDC,
including the payment of rent by SDC (the Guaranty). The lease and the related
Guaranty expire in January 2019. The obligation of the Fund to pay any amount

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT  29

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) --------------------------------------


due under the Guaranty is limited to a specified percentage of the full amount,
which generally is based on the Fund's percentage of the expenses billed by SDC
to all Guarantors in the preceding calendar quarter. As of June 30, 2009, the
Fund's total potential future obligation under the Guaranty over the life of the
Guaranty is $921,300. The net present value of this obligation as of June 12,
2009 has been expensed as part of the aforementioned Non-Recurring Charges.

5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of securities (other than short-term
obligations) aggregated $299,026,571 and $377,204,666, respectively, for the six
months ended June 30, 2009. Realized gains and losses are determined on an
identified cost basis.

6. CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS

Under the Fund's Charter, dividends on Common Stock cannot be declared unless
net assets, after such dividends and dividends on Preferred Stock, equal at
least $100 per share of Preferred Stock outstanding. The Preferred Stock is
subject to redemption at the Fund's option at any time on 30 days' notice at $55
per share (or a total of $41,400,700 for the shares outstanding) plus accrued
dividends, and entitled in liquidation to $50 per share plus accrued dividends.

The Fund, in connection with its Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Purchase
Plan and other Stockholder plans, acquires and issues shares of its own Common
Stock, as needed, to satisfy Plan requirements. For the six months ended June
30, 2009, the Fund purchased 629,207 shares of Common Stock from Plan
participants at a cost of $5,569,768, which represented a weighted average
discount of 13.8% from the net asset value of those acquired shares. A total of
238,102 shares were issued to Plan participants during the period for proceeds
of $2,096,305, a weighted average discount of 14.4% from the net asset value of
those shares. In addition, a total of 348,285 shares were issued at market price
in distributions during the period for proceeds of $2,958,559, a weighted
average discount of 15.2% from the net asset value of those shares.

The Fund may make additional purchases of its Common Stock in the open market
and elsewhere at such prices and in such amounts as the Board may deem
advisable. No such additional purchases were made during the six months ended
June 30, 2009.

At June 30, 2009, the Fund reserved 229,587 shares of Common Stock for issuance
upon exercise of 9,491 Warrants, each of which entitled the holder to purchase
24.19 shares of Common Stock at $0.93 per share.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30  TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Assuming the exercise of all Warrants outstanding at June 30, 2009, net
investment assets would have increased by $213,516 and the net asset value of
the Common Stock would have been $11.09 per share. The number of Warrants
exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and the year ended Dec. 31,
2008 was 500 and 994, respectively.

The Fund conducted a cash tender offer for up to 12.5% of its issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock, which expired on Feb. 11, 2009. The number
of shares of Common Stock that were tendered through the expiration date was
9,247,000 (or approximately 11.7% of the Fund's Common Stock outstanding).
Because less than 12.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Fund was tendered through the expiration date, all properly tendered shares
were accepted for purchase. The purchase price was equal to 99.25% of the net
asset value per share of the Fund's Common Stock as of the close of the regular
trading session of the NYSE on Feb. 12, 2009. The total value of the Common
Stock shares purchased was $93,024,820, which was paid in cash.

7. AFFILIATED MONEY MARKET FUND

The Fund may invest its daily cash balance in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund,
a money market fund established for the exclusive use of funds in the
RiverSource Family of Funds and other institutional clients of RiverSource
Investments. The cost of the Fund's purchases and proceeds from sales of shares
of RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund aggregated $20,183,964 and $1,138,836,
respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The income distributions
received with respect to the Fund's investment in RiverSource Short-Term Cash
Fund can be found in the Statement of Operations and the Fund's invested balance
in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund at June 30, 2009, can be found in the
Portfolio of Investments.

8. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of options contracts,
investments in partnerships, post-October losses and losses deferred due to wash
sales. The character of distributions made during the year from net investment
income or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for
federal income tax purposes. Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions,
the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may differ from the year that
the income or realized gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       TRI-CONTINENTAL CORPORATION -- 2009 SEMIANNUAL REPORT  31

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) --------------------------------------

For federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry-over of
$217,818,492 at Dec. 31, 2008, that if not offset by capital gains will expire
in 2016.

Because the measurement periods for a regulated investment company's income are
different for excise tax purposes versus income tax purposes, special rules are
in place to protect the amount of earnings and profits needed to support excise
tax distributions. As a result, the Fund is permitted to treat net capital
losses realized between Nov. 1, 2008 and its fiscal year end (post-October loss)
as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. At Dec. 31, 2008, the
Fund had a post-October loss of $414,241,970 that is treated for income tax
purposes as occurring on Jan. 1, 2009.

It is unlikely the Board will authorize a distribution of any net realized
capital gains until the available capital loss carry-over has been offset or
expires. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to utilize all of its
capital loss carry-over before it expires.

9. RISKS RELATING TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

To the extent that the Fund invests a substantial percentage of its assets in an
industry, the Fund's performance may be negatively affected if that industry
falls out of favor. Stocks of large-capitalization companies have at times
experienced periods of volatility and negative performance. During such periods,
the value of such stocks may decline and the Fund's performance may be
negatively affected.

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated Fund related events and transactions that occurred
during the period from the date of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities
through Aug. 24, 2009, the date of issuance of the Fund's financial statements.
There were no events or transactions that occurred during the period that
materially impacted the amounts or disclosures in the Fund's financial
statements.

11. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc. was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege
that they are investors in several American Express Company (now known as

behalf of those funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs
allege that fees allegedly paid to the defendants by the funds for investment

advisory and administrative services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies
including restitution and rescission of investment advisory and distribution
agreements. The plaintiffs voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the
United States District Court for the District of Minnesota (the District Court).
In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court
dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted plaintiffs limited
discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April 2007. Summary judgment
was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals (the Eighth Circuit)
on August 8, 2007. On April 8, 2009, the Eighth Circuit reversed summary
judgment and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. On August
6, 2009, defendants filed a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court,
asking the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the District Court proceedings while the
U.S. Supreme Court considers and rules in a case captioned Jones v. Harris
Associates, which involves issues of law similar to those presented in the
Gallus case.

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
(Ameriprise Financial), entered into settlement agreements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC)
related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million
and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain an
independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan for
distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the SEC in
accordance with various undertakings detailed at
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,
and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees.

On November 7, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC, a subsidiary of Ameriprise
Financial, Inc., acquired J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated (Seligman). In
late 2003, Seligman conducted an extensive internal review concerning mutual
fund trading practices. Seligman's review, which covered the period 2001-2003,
noted one arrangement that permitted frequent trading in certain open-end
registered investment companies managed by Seligman (the Seligman Funds); this
arrangement was in the process of being closed down by Seligman before September
2003. Seligman identified three other arrangements that permitted frequent
trading, all of which had been terminated by September 2002. In January 2004,
Seligman, on a voluntary basis, publicly disclosed these four arrangements to
its clients and to shareholders of the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) --------------------------------------


Seligman Funds. Seligman also provided information concerning mutual fund
trading practices to the SEC and the Office of the Attorney General of the State
of New York (NYAG).

In September 2006, the NYAG commenced a civil action in New York State Supreme
Court against Seligman, Seligman Advisors, Inc. (now known as RiverSource Fund
Distributors, Inc.), Seligman Data Corp. and Brian T. Zino (collectively, the
Seligman Parties), alleging, in substance, that the Seligman Parties permitted
various persons to engage in frequent trading and, as a result, the prospectus
disclosure used by the registered investment companies then managed by Seligman
was and had been misleading. The NYAG included other related claims and also
claimed that the fees charged by Seligman to the Seligman Funds were excessive.
On March 13, 2009, without admitting or denying any violations of law or
wrongdoing, the Seligman Parties entered into a stipulation of settlement with
the NYAG and settled the claims made by the NYAG. Under the terms of the
settlement, Seligman paid $11.3 million to four Seligman Funds. This settlement
resolved all outstanding matters between the Seligman Parties and the NYAG. In
addition to the foregoing matter, the New York staff of the SEC indicated in
September 2005 that it was considering recommending to the Commissioners of the
SEC the instituting of a formal action against Seligman and Seligman Advisors,
Inc. relating to frequent trading in the Seligman Funds. Seligman responded to
the staff in October 2005 that it believed that any action would be both
inappropriate and unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that Seligman had
previously resolved the underlying issue with the Independent Directors of the
Seligman Funds and made recompense to the affected Seligman Funds. There have
been no further developments with the SEC on this matter.

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise
Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate
to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be
obtained by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the funds. Further,
although we believe

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the funds or the
ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their
contracts with the funds, these proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as
such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may
result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in
adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief that could have
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of
operations of Ameriprise Financial.

PROXY VOTING  ------------------------------------------------------------------

The policy of the Board is to vote the proxies of the companies in which the
Fund holds investments consistent with the procedures as stated in the Statement
of Additional Information (SAI). You may obtain a copy of the SAI without charge
by calling the RiverSource Family of Funds at 1(800) 221-2450; visiting
seligman.com; or searching the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) at http://www.sec.gov. Information regarding how the Fund voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities is filed with the SEC by August 31 for the most
recent 12-month period ending June 30 of that year, and is available without
charge by visiting seligman.com; or searching the website of the SEC at

CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  -----------------------

On March 11, 2009, Ernst & Young LLP was selected as the Fund's independent
registered public accounting firm for the 2009 fiscal year. A majority of the
Fund's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors,
approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP effective March 18, 2009. On June
9, 2009, Fund Stockholders ratified the Board's selection of Ernst & Young LLP
as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for 2009. The
predecessor independent registered public accounting firm's reports on the
Fund's financial statements for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and the year ended
Dec. 31, 2007 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During such fiscal periods and through March 11, 2009 there were no
disagreements between the Fund and the predecessor independent registered public
accounting firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which such disagreements,
if not resolved to the satisfaction of the predecessor independent registered
public accounting firm, would have caused them to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports on the financial
statements for such fiscal periods.

(1)  On January 8, 2009, the registrant's Board renewed a modified version of
     the registrant's stock repurchase program. For 2009, the registrant is
     authorized to repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding Common Stock directly
     from stockholders and in the open market, provided that, with respect to
     shares repurchased in the open market the excess of the net asset value of
     a share of Common Stock over its market price (the discount) is greater
     than 10%. The registrant's 2008 stock repurchase program allowed the
     registrant to repurchase up to 5% of the registrant's outstanding Common
     Stock during the period directly from stockholders and in the open market,
     provided that, with respect to shares purchased in the open market, the
