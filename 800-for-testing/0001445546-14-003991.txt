                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                    ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                                  MAY 31, 2014


Dear Shareholders:

I am pleased to present you with the annual report for your investment in First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund").

As a shareholder, twice a year you receive a detailed report about your
investment, including portfolio commentary from the Fund's management team, a
performance analysis and a market and Fund outlook. Additionally, First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") compiles the Fund's financial statements for you
to review. These reports are intended to keep you up-to-date on your investment,
and I encourage you to read this document and discuss it with your financial
advisor.

As you are probably aware, the twelve months covered by this report saw both
challenging economic and political issues in the U.S. However, the period was
still positive for the markets. In fact, the S&P 500(R) Index, as measured on a
total return basis, rose 20.45% during the twelve months ended May 31, 2014. Of
course, past performance can never be an indicator of future performance, but
First Trust believes that staying invested in quality products through up and
down markets and having a long-term horizon can help investors as they work
toward their financial goals.

First Trust continues to offer a variety of products that we believe could fit
the financial plans for many investors seeking long-term investment success.
Your financial advisor can tell you about the other investments First Trust
offers that might fit your financial goals. We encourage you to discuss those
goals with your financial advisor regularly so that he or she can help keep you
on track and help you choose investments that match your goals.

First Trust will continue to make available up-to-date information about your
investments so you and your financial advisor are current on any First Trust
investments you own. We value our relationship with you, and thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
The primary investment objective of the Fund is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP
During the past 12 months, financial markets were largely influenced by both
positive and negative economic data in the U.S., the government shutdown in
October and geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia. Moreover,
investors placed increased scrutiny on the rhetoric from the Federal Reserve,
attempting to gauge the potential pace and timing of interest rate increases
given the fact that the Federal Reserve is now tapering its quantitative easing
bond buying stimulus, and guidance around the timing of short-term rate
increases has been inconsistent.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields began the period at 2.13%, increased above 3% at
the end of December, and ended the period at 2.48%, essentially up 35 basis
points from one year ago and down 52 basis points from the end of 2013. Despite
the measured pace of the quantitative easing taper from the Federal Reserve,
interest rates have not yet established a firm course. Amid the fluctuating rate
environment, Senior Loans returned 4.36% during the 12 months ended May 31,
2014, based on information gathered from S&P's "Leveraged Commentary & Data."
All subsequent citations in this commentary are derived from S&P's Leveraged
Commentary & Data.

We remain convinced that the economy will find its footing and economic data
will begin to improve. After all, monetary policy remains incredibly
stimulative, with the Federal Reserve buying bonds and maintaining low
short-term interest rates. Additionally, corporate profits remain healthy. As a
result, we believe interest rate risk is a more significant threat than credit
risk to fixed-income investors today. Moreover, the low corporate default risk
today should allow Senior Loans to perform well relative to other traditional
fixed-income asset classes in 2014, especially if interest rates begin to rise
in the back half of 2014.

SENIOR LOAN MARKET
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index ("Index") returned a modest 4.36% for the
12-month period ended May 31, 2014. Performance throughout the period was
consistently positive, with ten of twelve months posting positive performance.

From a credit quality perspective, lower credit-rated issues within the Index
provided the strongest performance for the period. Lower-quality CCC- rated
issues returned 7.74% in the period, significantly outperforming the returns of
higher-quality B- rated issues at 4.63% and BB- rated issues at 3.08%. The
average price of Senior Loans began the period at $98.2 and rose over the

12-month period to a high of $98.8. After 95 consecutive weeks of inflows into
the Senior Loan market via mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, the market
experienced its first retail fund outflow in April. Despite the modest retail
outflows recently, we continue to see strong inflows from institutional
investors. We believe this relief in retail demand is both modest in amount and
healthy after such an incredible run.


                                                                          Page 3

PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY (CONTINUED)

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


CREDIT QUALITY/DEFAULT RATES
One important factor helping support the positive returns for the period was the
continuation of a strong credit environment. The trailing 12-month default rate
at the end of May 2014 was 4.60% for Senior Loans. However, the default rate
increased primarily due to the default of a single issuer. TXU (Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Co. LLC; also known as Energy Future Holdings),
the largest Senior Loan issuer and a large high-yield bond issuer, defaulted
during the period, which was widely anticipated by investors. In our opinion,
this default is not a sign of weakening credit conditions in the overall credit
markets, nor is it a sign of heightened defaults. TXU is a single issuer that
struggled with an overleveraged balance sheet for several years. Excluding TXU
from the default rate provides a much clearer picture of the underlying
corporate fundamentals in the Senior Loan market. The default rate, excluding
TXU, was 1.13%. The long-term average default rate for Senior Loans is 3.25%
(for the period March 1999 - May 2014). As of May 31, 2014, TXU was a holding of
the Fund, representing 0.85% of the Fund's net assets.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The Fund's NAV outperformed the Index for the one-year period ended May 31,
2014. The Fund generated an NAV return(1) of 5.35% versus the 4.36% return for
the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index. Contributing to the Fund's NAV outperformance
relative to the Index over the period was the Fund's use of leverage and issuer
selection. Leverage at the end of May was approximately 30.37% of managed
assets. The Fund's relatively conservative credit quality positioning detracted
slightly from performance as CCC+ and lower-rated issues led the market return.
At the end of the period, the Fund held only 4.6% of assets in issues rated CCC+
or below, compared to 7.8% for the Index.

The Fund's market price return(1) for the period was -2.82%. The Fund's market
price return faced a headwind as the Fund's market price began at a slight
premium to NAV and moved to a discount to NAV by the end of the period. At the
start of the period, the Fund's market price was at a 1.52% premium to NAV, and
moved to a -6.35% discount to NAV by the end of the period.

The monthly distribution began the period at $0.0875 per share and ended at
$0.07125 per share. The consequence of strong demand for the Senior Loan asset
class has been the ability for issuers to refinance at lower rates and a
subsequent reduction in the yield on the Fund's holdings. At a $0.07125 per
share monthly distribution, the annualized distribution rate as of May 31, 2014
was 5.72% at NAV and 6.11% at market price.

OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the credit markets remains positive. The combination of a modest
default environment, better economic growth, sound corporate fundamentals and
strong investor demand for income provides a firm backdrop for future returns,
in our opinion.

We continue to believe that the primary hurdle facing the Senior Loan market
will be the strong demand for the asset class, as investors seek shelter from
the potential threat of increasing interest rates. The net effect of the strong
demand over the past year has been a refinancing wave, which has reduced coupons
within the market, and most notably, resulted in weaker Senior Loan structures
(e.g., loose terms on newly originated Senior Loans). In every market cycle, the
power shifts between arrangers of financial instruments and buyers of financial
instruments at different points. Today, the power is in the hands of the
arrangers; for example covenant lite transactions (loan agreements that do not
contain the usual protective covenants for the benefit of the lending party) and
shorter call protection have all become commonplace. While some would have
investors run for the hills under such conditions, we tend to have a more
practical perspective. The simple reality is that weaker structures do not cause
corporations to default, nor, in our opinion, do they cause losses to occur.
However, we believe weaker Senior Loan structures have the potential to
introduce more volatility into the asset class in the future. For example,
covenant lite Senior Loan transactions that defaulted experienced recovery rates
in 2008 and 2009 largely consistent with covenanted Senior Loans. However,
covenant lite Senior Loans traded with more volatility relative to Senior Loans
that had financial maintenance covenants (in covenant lite transactions, there
were no covenant traps to allow for a re-pricing of risk). In summary, while
structures have weakened, corporate fundamentals remain sound, and strong asset
selection with a deep understanding of the businesses and documentation are
vital to generating attractive long term returns within the Senior Loan asset
class. We also believe that asset value and cash flow are the predominant
drivers of returns within the asset class. Despite the risk factors, we believe
Senior Loans remain attractive, and could return 4.5%-5% in calendar-year 2014,
although there can be no assurance these returns will be achieved.

As we evaluate new investment opportunities, decisions will continue to be
rooted in our rigorous bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the opportunities
that we believe offer the best risk and reward balance. Despite the many
distractions that ebb and flow every quarter, we remained firmly focused on
finding value in the Senior Loan market.

1     Total return is based on the combination of reinvested dividend, capital
      gain and return of capital distributions, if any, at prices obtained by
      the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in NAV per share for net asset
      value returns and changes in Common Share price for market value returns.
      Total returns do not reflect sales load and are not annualized for periods
      less than one year. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
      prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
      certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
      floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
      reflects the rate in effect at May 31, 2014. When a range of rates is
      disclosed, the Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche
      at varying rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   This issuer has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(e)   This issuer is in default but interest is still being accrued by the Fund
      and paid by the issuer.

(f)   This Senior Loan is a subordinated payment-in-kind ("PIK") loan that pays
      1.00% PIK interest. Interest is to be paid annually in the form of
      additional principal. The first interest payment is scheduled for March 3,
      2015.

(g)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended, and may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant to
      procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has been
      determined to be liquid by First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's advisor.
      Although market instability can result in periods of increased overall
      market illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on
      security specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective
      judgment. At May 31, 2014, securities noted as such are valued at
      $12,023,437 or 3.01% of net assets.

(h)   This security is fair valued in accordance with procedures adopted by the
      Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(i)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(j)   Non-income producing security.

(k)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $566,480,563. As of May
      31, 2014, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $1,847,561 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $2,153,691.

</TABLE>

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.

All transfers in and out of Level 3 during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. As of May 31,
2014, the Fund transferred Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests valued at
$4,067,775 from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Senior
Floating-Rate Loan Interests that transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 did so
primarily as a result of a change in information obtained from an independent
third party pricing service relating to the market activity of individual Senior
Floating-Rate Loan Interests. Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are
valued using third party pricing service prices. These values are based on
unobservable and non-quantitative inputs, such as dealer runs and indicative
sheets from brokers. The Fund's Board of Trustees has adopted valuation
procedures that are utilized by the Pricing Committee to oversee the day-to-day
valuation of the Fund's investments. The Pricing Committee, through the Fund's
fund accounting agent, monitors daily pricing via tolerance checks and stale and
unchanged price reviews. The Pricing Committee also reviews monthly back testing
of pricing service prices by comparing sales prices of Fund investments to prior
day pricing service prices. Additionally, the Pricing Committee reviews periodic
information from the Fund's third party pricing service that compares secondary
market trade prices to their daily valuations.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior
floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans").(1) There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value, in
accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with provisions of the 1940 Act. Market quotations and prices
used to value the Fund's investments are primarily obtained from third party
pricing services. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

     The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
     exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
     institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
     that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
     although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
     grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and
     less liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities.
     Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and
     information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or
     may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the market value of
     Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated information. Because
     there is less reliable, objective data available, elements of judgment may
     play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans than for other types of
     securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued using information provided
     by a third party pricing service. The third party pricing service primarily
     uses over-the-counter pricing from dealer runs and broker quotes from
     indicative sheets to value the Senior Loans.

     Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or foreign
     exchange (excluding The NASDAQ(R) Stock Market, LLC ("NASDAQ") and the
     London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at
     the last sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded
     or, for NASDAQ and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities
     traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale
     price or official closing price, as applicable, at the close of the
     securities exchange representing the principal market for such securities.

     Bonds, notes and other debt securities are valued on the basis of
     valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such securities or by an
     independent pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees, which
     may use the following valuation inputs when available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;
      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.



(1)   The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.


                                                                         Page 23

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


     Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when
     purchased are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
     accretion of discounts.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate at fair value. These securities generally include, but are not limited
to, restricted securities (securities which may not be publicly sold without
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")) for
which a pricing service is unable to provide a market price; securities whose
trading has been formally suspended; a security whose market price is not
available from a pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to
which an event has occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the
security after the market has closed but before the calculation of the Fund's
NAV or make it difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation;
and a security whose price, as provided by the pricing service, does not reflect
the security's "fair value." As a general principle, the current "fair value" of
a security would appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect
to receive for the security upon its current sale. The use of fair value prices
by the Fund generally results in prices used by the Fund that may differ from
current market quotations or official closing prices on the applicable exchange.
A variety of factors may be considered in determining the fair value of such
securities, including, but not limited to, the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;
      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
      10)   the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
      11)   the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
      12)   borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
      13)   borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
      14)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2014, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward purchase commitments as of May
31, 2014.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had no unfunded delayed draw loan commitments as
of May 31, 2014.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior
to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt
from registration under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified
institutional buyers. As of May 31, 2014, the Fund held restricted securities as
shown in the following table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that
such securities be registered. These securities are valued according to the
valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and
are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted investments with the same
maturity date and yield for this issuer.

* Amount is less than 0.01%.


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the
year ended May 31, 2014, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have
been reclassified at year end to reflect an increase in accumulated net
investment income (loss) of $962,822, an increase in accumulated net realized
gain (loss) on investments of $1,552 and a decrease to paid-in capital of
$964,374. Net assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2014 and 2013 is as follows:


                 Distributions paid from:             2014             2013
                                                  -------------   -------------

As of May 31, 2014, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years after December 31, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term
and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for
up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the
Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment
net capital losses. At May 31, 2014, the Fund had pre-enactment net capital
losses for federal income tax purposes of $98,951,987 expiring as follows:

         EXPIRATION DATE             AMOUNT
         May 31, 2016           $   422,155
         May 31, 2017            25,585,953
         May 31, 2018            68,278,827
         May 31, 2019             4,665,052

During the taxable year ended May 31, 2014, the Fund utilized pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $689,527.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for federal
income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, the Fund incurred
and elected to to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses    $         --
Capital Losses        3,099,237

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2011, 2012,
2013 and 2014 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2014,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

retainer that is allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex based on net assets. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an annual per

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2014


Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee Chairmen rotate every
three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from
the Fund for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2014, were $530,956,559 and
$553,440,011, respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

Effective July 13, 2012, the Fund entered into a Revolving Credit and Security
Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit
lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as secondary lender and agent for the secured
parties under the agreement. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of
credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the
Fund. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit
Facility bear interest for each settlement period at a rate per annum based on
the commercial paper rate of the conduit lender. Effective July 12, 2013, the
Credit Facility was amended, whereby; the expiration date of the Credit Facility
was extended until July 11, 2014 and an upfront amendment fee of $95,000 was
paid by the Fund. Such fees are amortized over a one year period and are
included with the other borrowing costs in "Interest and fees on loan" on the
Statement of Operations. The Credit Facility may be renewed annually. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets
after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$190,000,000 (prior to July 12, 2013, the total commitment was $175,000,000). In
addition, the Fund pays a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.35% (prior to
July 12, 2013, the per annum rate was 0.40%) of the average daily of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar
month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.35%
(prior to July 12, 2013, the per annum rate was 0.40%) of the daily average of
the total commitment in effect (or if terminated, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the advances funded or maintained) during the preceding
calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

For the year ended May 31, 2014, the average amount outstanding under the Credit
Facility was $174,383,562. The high and low annual interest rates for the loan
under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the year ended May
31, 2014, were 0.21% and 0.20%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.20%. The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at May 31,
2014, was 0.20%.

                           6. COMMON SHARE OFFERINGS

On November 21, 2012, the Fund and the Advisor entered into a sales agreement
with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC ("JonesTrading") whereby the Fund
may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 Common Shares from time to time through
JonesTrading as agent for the offer and sale of the Common Shares. Effective
August 22, 2013, the sales agreement with JonesTrading was amended and as a
result, the Fund may offer and sell up to 4,225,967 Common Shares. Sales of
Common Shares pursuant to the sales agreement may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" as defined in
Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales
made through a market maker other than on an exchange, at an offering price
equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share of the Fund's Common
Shares at the time such Common Shares are initially sold. The Fund intends to
use the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares in accordance with its
investment objectives and policies. Transactions related to offerings under such
sales agreement are as follows:


                                                                  NET PROCEEDS

                     -----------  ------------  ---------------  --------------
Year Ended 5/31/14     196,487    $  3,035,923  $     2,952,237  $       83,686
Year Ended 5/31/13   1,029,480      16,309,080       15,524,292         784,788


Estimated offering costs of $235,169 related to the November 21, 2012 offering
were recorded as a prepaid asset and were amortized to expense by the Fund on a
straight line basis over a one year period and included in "Prepaid expenses" on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Additionally, on August 23, 2013,
estimated offering costs of $175,000 related to the offering were recorded as a
prepaid asset and are being amortized to expense by the Fund on a straight line
basis over the lesser of one year or until the Fund sells 4,225,967 Common
Shares related to this offering.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.


                                                                         Page 27

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2014, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2014, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian and agent banks; where replies were not received, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2014, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree. High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and
risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an
issuer's creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the
default by an issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for
high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade
securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including


                                                                         Page 31

                            MAY 31, 2014 (UNAUDITED)


dividends and distributions with respect to Common Shares or purchase Common
Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the likelihood of greater
volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares. Leverage also increases
the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt
that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to the Common Shareholders or will
result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy
experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become
distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in
sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to
raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by
Fund shareholders.

that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

      (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
             through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
             adviser of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
             pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph
             (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
             are as follows:

                          (b)  0%
                          (c)  0%
                          (d)  0%

      (f)   The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
            engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the
            most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
            persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent
            employees was less than fifty percent.

      (g)   The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
            for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the
            registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
            provides ongoing services to the Registrant for 2013 were $5,200 and
            $3,000 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser,
            respectively, and for 2014 were $5,200 and $36,800 for the
            Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser, respectively.

      (h)   The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
            that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not
            pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
            Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
            accountant's independence.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Team
adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations.

In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the Code of Ethics
and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the Leveraged Finance
Team currently are prohibited from buying or selling equity securities
(including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and futures) and
corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over which they
exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Team are also prohibited
from engaging in any personal transaction while in possession of material
non-public information regarding the security or the issuer of the security.
First Trust and FTP also maintain a confidential watch list of all issuers for
which the Leveraged Finance Team has material non-public information in its
possession an all transactions executed for a product advised or supervised by
First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the restricted list.

      (A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
             MEMBERS

INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF MAY 31, 2014

The compensation structure for the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined
by the management of First Trust.

Salaries are determined by management and are based upon an individual's
position and overall value to the firm. Bonuses are also determined by
management and are based upon an individual's overall contribution to the
success of the firm and the profitability of the firm. Salaries and bonuses for
members of the Leveraged Finance Team are not based upon criteria such as
performance of the Registrant or the value of assets of the Fund, although
discretionary bonuses for Leveraged Finance Team members are based on the
profitability of the leveraged finance department.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.

<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.

            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
