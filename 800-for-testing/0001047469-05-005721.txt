                      PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS, AND PROXY VOTING

PRIVACY. The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial
privacy. Each of the financial institutions identified below has in effect the
following policy ("Privacy Policy") with respect to nonpublic personal
information about its customers:

   -  Only such information received from you, through application forms or
      otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will
      be collected. This may include information such as name, address, social
      security number, tax status, account balances and transactions.

   -  None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed
      to anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to
      employees necessary to service your account). In the normal course of
      servicing a customer's account, Eaton Vance may share information with
      unaffiliated third parties that perform various required services such as
      transfer agents, custodians and broker/dealers.

   -  Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural
      safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality
      of such information.

   -  We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time upon proper
      notification to you. Customers may want to review our Policy periodically
      for changes by accessing the link on our homepage: www.eatonvance.com.

Our pledge of privacy applies to the following entities within the Eaton Vance
organization: the Eaton Vance Family of Funds, Eaton Vance Management, Eaton
Vance Investment Counsel, Boston Management and Research, and Eaton Vance
Distributors, Inc.

In addition, our Privacy Policy only applies to those Eaton Vance customers who
are individuals and who have a direct relationship with us. If a customer's
account (i.e., fund shares) is held in the name of a third-party financial
adviser/broker-dealer, it is likely that only such adviser's privacy policies
apply to the customer. This notice supersedes all previously issued privacy
disclosures.

      For more information about Eaton Vance's Privacy Policy, please call
                                 1-800-262-1122.

DELIVERY OF SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS. The Securities and Exchange Commission
permits funds to deliver only one copy of shareholder documents, including
prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder reports, to fund investors with
multiple accounts at the same residential or post office box address. This
practice is often called "householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate
mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS. Each Eaton Vance Fund and its underlying Portfolio (if
applicable) will file a schedule of its portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the first and third quarters of each
fiscal year. The Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance website
www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the EDGAR
database on the Securities and Exchange Commision's website at www.sec.gov. Form
N-Q may also be reviewed and copied at the SEC's public reference room in
Washington, D.C. (call 1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the
public reference room).

PROXY VOTING. From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to
the securities held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying
Portfolios (if applicable) vote proxies according to a set of policies and
procedures approved by the Funds' and Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a
description of these policies and procedures and information on how the Funds or
Portfolios voted proxies relating to Portfolio securities during the most recent
12 month period ended June 30, without charge, upon request, by calling
1-800-262-1122. This description is also available on the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of December 31, 2004

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

THE TRUST

    PERFORMANCE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004
- -   Based on the Trust's December 2004 monthly dividend payment of $0.037 and a
    closing share price of $8.73, the Trust had a market yield of 5.09%.(1) The
    Trust's market yield represented a yield advantage over many other
    income-producing vehicles during the period.

- -   Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had
    a total return of -5.44% for the six months ended December 31, 2004.(2) That
    return was the result of a decrease in share price from $9.46 on June 30,
    2004 to $8.73 on December 31, 2004 and the reinvestment of $0.217 in monthly
    dividend payments.

- -   Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 2.71% for the six
    months ended December 31, 2004.(2) That return was the result of an increase
    in net asset value from $8.78 on June 30, 2004 to $8.80 on December 31,
    2004, and the reinvestment of all distributions.

- -   For performance comparison, the S&P/Loan Syndications and Trading
    Association (LSTA) Index , had a return of 2.26% for the six months ended
    December 31, 2004.(3)

    THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS
- -   The Trust is a closed-end fund and trades on the New York Stock Exchange.
    The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current
    income, consistent with preservation of capital, by investing primarily in
    senior loans. The Trust invests primarily in senior secured floating-rate
    loans. The Trust also employs leverage through the issuance of preferred
    shares and participation in a commercial paper program.(4)

- -   The Trust's senior floating-rate loan investments included 347 borrowers,
    ranging across 37 industries at December 31, 2004. The Trust's average loan
    size was just 0.25% of loan assets (based on net assets), and no industry
    constituted more than 7.0% of the Trust's loan investments.
    Telecommunications, automotive, publishing, containers and glass products
    and health care were the Trust's largest loan sector weightings.*

- -   The Federal Reserve raised its Federal Funds rate - a short-term interest
    rate benchmark - five times from June 30, 2004 through December 31, 2004.
    With their relatively short interest rate reset provisions, floating-rate
    loans have historically generated higher income in response to rising
    short-term rates.

- -   Due to improving fundamentals and strong technical factors in the loan
    market, loan credit spreads for new issues narrowed and prices averaged
    above-par in the secondary market. These trends have increased the
    importance of diligent credit risk-management.

- -   The Trust's high-yield corporate bond holdings constituted 16.3% of its net
    assets at December 31, 2004 (9.6% of total investments). This component
    provided a yield enhancement for the Trust and performed well during the
    past year.

- -   At December 31, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
    42% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust uses leverage through the
    issuance of preferred shares and participation in a commercial paper
    program. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased
    income but, at the same time, creates special risks (including the
    likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
    common shares).

     * HOLDINGS AND SECTOR WEIGHTINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO ACTIVE
       MANAGEMENT.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND
ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE
PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. THE RETURNS DO NOT
INCLUDE DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN DECEMBER 2004 AND PAYABLE IN 2005. INVESTMENT
RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE
WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME
PERIOD ONLY; DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE FUND'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE
LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND ARE
CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE COVER.
THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR OTHER
CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH VIEWS.
THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE INVESTMENT
DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED
ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY EATON VANCE FUND.

(1) THE TRUST'S MARKET YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MOST RECENT DIVIDEND
    PER SHARE BY THE SHARE MARKET PRICE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND ANNUALIZING
    THE RESULT. (2) RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE
    PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN SHARE PRICE OR NET ASSET VALUE WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS
    REINVESTED. PERFORMANCE RESULTS REFLECT THE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE RESULTING
    FROM THE TRUST'S ISSUANCE OF AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES. (3) IT IS NOT
    POSSIBLE TO INVEST DIRECTLY IN AN INDEX. THE INDEX'S TOTAL RETURN DOES NOT
    REFLECT THE COMMISSIONS OR EXPENSES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED IF AN
    INVESTOR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED OR SOLD THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED IN THE
    INDEX. (4) IN THE EVENT OF A RISE IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, THE VALUE OF
    THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE ASSET
    COVERAGE FOR ITS AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES.

SHARES OF THE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES ARE SUBJECT
TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTED. YIELD WILL
VARY.

Note: The Trust has made commitments to fund specified amounts under certain
      existing credit arrangments. Pursuant to the terms of these arrangements,
      the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of $3,817,240 as of December 31,
      2004.
PIK - Payment In Kind.
(1)  Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
     flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
     borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election,
     cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
     maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
     However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests will
     have an expected average life of approximately two to three years. The
     stated interest rate represents the weighted average interest rate of all
     contracts within the senior loan facility. Interest rates are periodically
     predetermined by a reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These
     base lending rates are generally (i) the prime rate offered by one or more
     major United States banks or (ii) the lending rate offered by one or more
     European banks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
(2)  Security valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
     at the direction of the Trustees.
(3)  Defaulted security.
(4)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. These securities may be sold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At December 31,
     2004, the aggregate value of the securities is $16,963,390 or 5.3% of the
     Trust's net assets.
(5)  Non-income producing security.
(6)  Restricted security.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of December 31, 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. The
Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing primarily in senior,
floating rate loans. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- The Trust's investments are primarily in interests in
senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). Certain Senior Loans are deemed
liquid because reliable market quotations are readily available for them. Liquid
loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service. Other
Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's investment adviser, Eaton
Vance Management (EVM), under procedures established by the Trustees as
permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such
procedures include the consideration of relevant factors, data and information
relating to fair value, including (i) the characteristics of and fundamental
analytical data relating to the Senior Loan, including the cost, size, current
interest rate, period until next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending
rate of the Senior Loan, the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any
related agreements and the position of the loan in the borrower's debt
structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the
Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the
creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on evaluations of its financial
condition, financial statements and information about the Borrower's business,
cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv) information relating to
the market for the Senior Loan including price quotations for and trading in the
Senior Loan and interests in similar loans and the market environment and
investor attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar loans; (v)
the experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and
any intermediate participant in the loan; and (vi) general economic and market
conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Non-loan portfolio
holdings (other than short-term obligations, but including listed issues) may be
valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing services which
determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units of such securities
using market information, transactions for comparable securities and various
relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional
traders. In certain circumstances, portfolio securities will be valued at the
last sales price on the exchange that is the primary market for such securities,
or the average of the last quoted bid price for those securities for which the
over-the-counter market is the primary market or for listed securities in which
there were no sales during the day. Marketable securities listed in the NASDAQ
National Market System are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. The
value of interest rate swaps will be based upon a dealer quotation. Short-term
obligations which mature in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if
their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was 60 days or less
or are valued at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior to
maturity, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was more
then 60 days, unless in each case this is determined not to represent fair
value. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Other
portfolio securities for which there are no quotations or valuations are valued
at fair value as determined in good faith by or on behalf of the Trustees.

B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual basis
at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is determined
on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or
discount. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends
received in cash and/or securities.

C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
or excise tax is necessary. At June 30, 2004, the Trust, for federal income tax
purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $49,875,806, which will expire on June
30, 2009 ($1,925,241), June 30, 2010 ($27,557,475), June 30, 2011 ($13,711,847)
and June 30, 2012 ($6,681,243). These amounts will reduce the Trust's taxable
income arising from future net realized gain on investments, if any, to the
extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of
the distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve
the Trust of any liability for federal income or excise tax.

Additionally, at June 30, 2004, the Trust had net capital losses of $850,511
attributable to security transactions incurred after October 31, 2003. These are
treated as arising on the first day of the Trust's current taxable year.

                                       25

D CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts
for risk management purposes, including diversification. When the Trust is a
buyer of a credit default swap contract, the Trust is entitled to receive the
par (or other agreed-upon) value of a referenced debt obligation from the
counterparty to the contract in the event of a default by a third party, such as
a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the debt obligation. In return, the Trust
would pay the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default occurs,
the Trust would have spent the stream of payments and received no benefit from
the contract. When the Trust is the seller of a credit default swap contract, it
receives the stream of payments, but is obligated to pay upon default of the
referenced debt obligations. As the seller, the Trust would effectively add
leverage to its portfolio because, in addition to its total net assets, the
Trust would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the
swap. The Trust will segregate assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap of
which it is the seller, marked to market on a daily basis. These transactions
involve certain risks, including the risk that the seller may be unable to
fulfill the transaction.

E EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a fee reduced by
credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balances the Trust
maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the Trust's custodian
fees are reported as a reduction of expenses in the statement of operations.

F USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

G INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers
and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties of the Trust and shareholders are
indemnified against personal liability for obligations of the Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into agreements
with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Trust's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

H OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the investments
are purchased or sold. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the
basis of identified cost.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

The Trust issued 2,200 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,200
shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on June 27, 2001 in a public
offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as a
reduction to paid in capital. Dividends on the APS, which accrue daily, are paid
cumulatively at a rate which was established at the offering of the APS and have
been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates ranged from
0.85% to 2.65% for Series A and 1.22% to 2.67% for Series B, during the six
months ended December 31, 2004. Series A and Series B are identical in all
respects except for the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust at a redemption price equal to
$25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend payment
date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a redemption price
equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if the Trust
is in default on its asset maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If
the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full
years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a
majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the
common shares have equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the
holders of the APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two
members of the Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of
$25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required
to maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
Trust's By-Laws. The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred
shares' liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the
preferred auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Trust intends to make monthly distributions to common shareholders of net
investment income, after payment of any dividends on any outstanding preferred
shares. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
preferred shareholders are recorded daily

                                       26
<Page>

and are payable at the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period
for the APS is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on
December 31, 2004 was 2.65% and 2.67%, for Series A and Series B shares,
respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, the Trust paid
dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $489,157 and $494,381
for Series A and Series B shares, respectively, representing an average APS
dividend rate for such period of 1.76% and 1.79%, respectively.

4  COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

5  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The investment adviser fee, computed at a monthly rate of 17/240 of 1% (0.85%
annually) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by EVM as
compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
Trust. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, the fee was equivalent to
0.85% (annualized) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets and amounted to
$2,354,870. Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members of EVM's
organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services to
the Trust out of such investment adviser fee. EVM also serves as the
administrator of the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the monthly rate
of 1/48 of 1% (0.25% annually) of the average weekly gross assets of the Trust,
is paid to EVM for managing and administering business affairs of the Trust. For
the six months ended December 31, 2004, the fee was equivalent to 0.25%
(annualized) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets for such period and
amounted to $692,609.

Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
organization.

6  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Trust invests primarily in Senior Loans. The ability of the issuers of the
Senior Loans held by the Trust to meet their obligations may be affected by
economic developments in a specific industry. The cost of purchases and the
proceeds from principal repayments and sales of Senior Loans, corporate bonds
and equities aggregated $202,425,804 and $199,895,573, respectively, for the six
months ended December 31, 2004.

7  SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS

The Trust has entered into a revolving credit agreement that will allow the
Trust to borrow $120 million to support the issuance of commercial paper and to
permit the Trust to invest in accordance with its investment practices. Interest
is charged under the revolving credit agreement at the bank's base rate or at an
amount above either the bank's adjusted certificate of deposit rate or federal
funds effective rate. Interest expense includes commercial paper program fees of
approximately $186,000 and a commitment fee of approximately $92,000 which is
computed at the annual rate of 0.15% on the unused portion of the revolving
credit agreement. There were no significant borrowings under this agreement
during the period. As of December 31, 2004, the Trust had commercial paper
outstanding of $120,000,000, at an interest rate of 2.24% and is reflected in
the demand note payable on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Maximum and
average borrowings for the six months ended December 31, 2004 were $120,000,000
and $120,000,000, respectively, and the average interest rate was 1.74%.

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Portfolio may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
the normal course of its investing activities and to assist in managing exposure
to various market risks. These financial instruments include written options,
financial futures contracts and interest rate swaps and may involve, to a
varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for
financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these
instruments represent the investment the Portfolio has in particular classes of
financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially
subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments
is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

At December 31, 2004, the Trust had entered into credit default swaps with
Credit Suisse First Boston dated

                                       27
<Page>

February 6, 2004 whereby the Trust will receive 2.45% per year times the
notional amount of $2,600,000. The Trust makes payment only upon a default event
on underlying loan assets (47 in total, each representing 2.128% of the notional
value of the swap). At December 31, 2004, the Trust had sufficient cash
segregated to cover potential obligations arising from open swap contracts.

   (UNAUDITED)

The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of the investment
securities at December 31, 2004, as computed on a federal income tax basis, were

NET UNREALIZED APPRECIATION            $    8,203,247
- -----------------------------------------------------
</Table>

10 RESTRICTED SECURITIES

At December 31, 2004, the Trust owned the following securities (representing
less than 0.1% of net assets) which were restricted as to public resale and not
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (excluding Rule 144A securities).
The Portfolio has various registration rights (exercisable under a variety of
circumstances) with respect to these securities. The fair value of these
securities is determined based on valuations provided by brokers when available,
or if not available, they are valued at fair value using methods determined in
good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST as of December 31, 2004

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) as
of December 31, 2004, and the related statements of operations and cash flows
for the six months then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the
six months ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ended June 30, 2004, and the
financial highlights for the six months ended December 31, 2004 and for each of
the years in the five-year period ended June 30, 2004. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and supplementary data are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities and Senior
Loans owned at December 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and
selling or agent banks; where replies were not received from selling or agent
banks, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Senior Income Trust at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations,
the changes in its net assets, its cash flows and its financial highlights for
the respective stated periods in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc. at
1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 8. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

No such purchases this period.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 7, 2005, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
revised the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees to
the registrant's Board of Trustees to add the following (highlighted):

The Governance Committee shall, when identifying candidates for the position of
Independent Trustee, consider any such candidate recommended by a shareholder of
a Fund if such recommendation contains (i)sufficient background information
concerning the candidate, INCLUDING EVIDENCE THE CANDIDATE IS WILLING TO SERVE
AS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE IF SELECTED FOR THE POSITION; AND (ii) is received in
a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the date specified
