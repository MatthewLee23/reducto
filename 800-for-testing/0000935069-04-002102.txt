1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. is a limited liability company recently
formed  under  the laws of the  State  of  Delaware  and  registered  under  the
Investment   Company   Act  of  1940  (the  "1940   Act"),   as  a   closed-end,
non-diversified,  management investment company. The Fund's investment objective
is to  generate  consistent  capital  appreciation  over  the  long  term,  with
relatively low  volatility and a low  correlation  with  traditional  equity and
fixed-income  markets.  The Fund  will  seek to  accomplish  this  objective  by
allocating its assets primarily among  professionally  selected investment funds
("Investment  Funds")  that are managed by  experienced  third-party  investment
advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets and employ,
as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ("J.P. Morgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation
of assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board
of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited  liability
company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),
serves as the managing  member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as
a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The Special  Member is  entitled  to all  performance-based
incentive allocations, if any from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager as of the last business day of each month in accordance with
the valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to
time pursuant to policies established by the Board.

The Fund's investments in the Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and
can only be redeemed periodically. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to
which the Fund values its  investments  in  Investment  Funds at fair value.  In
accordance with these procedures,  fair value as of each month-end ordinarily is
the value determined as of such month-end for each Investment Fund in accordance
with the Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies and reported at the time of the
Fund's valuation.

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that the Fund could  reasonably  expect to receive from an
Investment  Fund  if the  Fund's  interest  were  redeemed  at the  time  of the
valuation,  based on information  reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would  determine  the fair value of such  Investment  Fund based on the
most recent value  reported by the  Investment  Fund, as well any other relevant
information  available  at the time the Fund  values its  portfolio.  The values
assigned to these  investments  are based on  available  information  and do not
necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such amounts
depend on future  circumstances  and cannot  reasonably be determined  until the
individual investments are actually liquidated.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund.

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance;  registration expenses; due diligence,  including travel and
related expenses;  expenses of meetings of the Board and Members; all costs with
respect to  communications  to  Members;  and other  types of expenses as may be
approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the payment of Federal,
state or local  income  taxes has been  provided.  Each  Member is  individually
required  to report on its own tax return its  distributive  share of the Fund's
taxable income or loss.

G. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies on deposit at PNC Bank, N.A.

H. INITIAL OFFERING COSTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

The  Fund  incurred  initial  offering  costs  totaling  approximately  $409,796
comprised principally of legal costs pertaining to the preparation of the Fund's
offering  documents.  These costs are being amortized over a twelve-month period
from the commencement of operations.

Costs incurred in connection with the  organization of the Fund were expensed at
the commencement of operations.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.0125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) and an additional
administrative  services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis)
of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive  Allocation
do not exceed 2.30%  (compromising  the 1.5%  Management  Fee, the 0.15% Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee  and not  more  than a  further  0.65%  for  other
operating  expenses) on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense limitations.  Total
expenses  of the Fund  assumed by the  Investment  Manager  for the period  from
August 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004 were $106,166.

The  Fund has  entered  into an  investor  services  agreement  with  PFPC  Inc.
("PFPC"), whereby PFPC provides fund accounting,  investor services and transfer
agency  functions  for the Fund. As  compensation  for services set forth herein
that are rendered by PFPC during the term of this Agreement,  the Fund pays PFPC
a fee for services rendered. PFPC waived $12,500 of its fees for the period from
August  1,  2004  through  September  30,  2004.  Any  fees  waived  by PFPC are
recoverable  from the Fund if the agreement  with PFPC is terminated  within the
first three years.

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

PFPC  Trust  Company  serves as  custodian  of the Fund's  assets  and  provides
custodial services to the Fund.

4. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate  purchases of Investment  Funds amounted to $54,468,000 for the period
ended September 30, 2004.

At September 30, 2004, the estimated cost of investments  for Federal income tax
purposes  was  substantially  the  same  as the  cost  for  financial  reporting
purposes.   Accordingly,   gross  unrealized  depreciation  on  investments  was
$919,937,  gross unrealized appreciation on investments was $530,008,  resulting
in net unrealized depreciation on investments of $389,929.

5. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date, the Fund intends to
accept subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September,  and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the
day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a Member's purchase of its
Interests.

At the end of each Allocation  Period of the Fund, any net capital  appreciation
or net capital  depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized),  as the
case  may  be,  is  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all of the  Members
(including  the Special  Member and the Managing  Member) in proportion to their
respective  opening capital account  balances for such  Allocation  Period.  The
initial  "Allocation  Period"  began on the  Initial  Closing  Date,  with  each
subsequent  Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the  last  day of each  month,  (2) the  date  immediately  prior  to the
effective  date of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an  increase  in a
Member's  capital  contribution,  (3) the  effective  date of any  repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

5. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

At the end of each calendar  year, a Member's  return on its  investment for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital  account  during the year,  net of such Member's pro rata
share of the  Management  Fee,  is  reallocated  to the  capital  account of the
Special Member in the following manner: (1) net capital  appreciation up to a 6%
return  remains  allocated  to such Member  (the  "Preferred  Return");  (2) net
capital  appreciation  in excess of the Preferred  Return is  reallocated to the
Special  Member  until  it has been  allocated  the next  0.30% of  return  (the
"Catch-Up");  and (3) thereafter,  95% of any net capital appreciation in excess
of the Preferred Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member,  and
the remaining 5% of such net capital  appreciation is reallocated to the Special
Member.  The amounts  reallocated  to the Special Member under (2) and (3) above
are referred to as the "Incentive Allocation."

No Incentive  Allocation is made,  however,  with respect to a Member's  capital
account until any cumulative net capital  depreciation  previously  allocated to
such Member's  capital  account plus any Management Fees charged to such capital
account (the "Loss Carryforward") have been recovered.  Any Loss Carryforward of
a Member is reduced  proportionately to reflect the repurchase of any portion of
that Member's Interest.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these
investments reported by the Fund.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment  Funds invest in actively  traded  securities and other
financial  instruments  using  different  strategies and investment  techniques,
including leverage, that may involve significant risks. The Investment Funds may
invest a high  percentage  of their assets in specific  sectors of the market in
order to achieve a  potentially  greater  investment  return.  As a result,  the
Investment Funds may be more susceptible to economic,  political, and regulatory
developments in a particular  sector of the market,  positive and negative,  and
may experience  increased  volatility of the Investment  Funds' net asset value.
The Fund invests in a limited number of Investment Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

J.P. MORGAN MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK (CONTINUED)

Because of the  limitation on rights of redemption  and the fact that the Fund's
limited  liability  company  interests  will  not be  traded  on any  securities
exchange  or other  market and will be subject to  substantial  restrictions  on
transfer,  and because of the fact that the Fund may invest in Investment  Funds
that do not  permit  frequent  withdrawals  and  that  may  invest  in  illiquid
securities,  an  investment  in the Fund is a  highly  illiquid  investment  and
involves a substantial degree of risk.  Illiquid  securities owned by Investment
Funds are riskier than liquid securities because the Investment Funds may not be
able to dispose  of the  illiquid  securities  if their  investment  performance
deteriorates,  or may be able to dispose of the  illiquid  securities  only at a
greatly reduced price.  Similarly,  the illiquidity of the Investment  Funds may
cause  investors  to incur  losses  because of an  inability  to withdraw  their
investments from the Fund during or following  periods of negative  performance.
Although the Investment Manager and the Managing Member intend to recommend that
quarterly offers be made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there
can be no assurance that the Fund will make such offers.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Fund received subscriptions from investors of $4,820,000 on October 1, 2004.
