                               GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                               Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                               structure combines the specialized expertise of
                               three world-class investment management groups--
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE          Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                               autonomously, relying on its own research and
                               staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                               that underlie its success.

                               FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                               recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                               also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                               U.S. equity investing.

                               TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                               international investing and, in 1954, launched
                               what has become the industry's oldest global
                               fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                               Templeton offers investors a truly global
                               perspective.

                               MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                               dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                               searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                               it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                               arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION           Because our management groups work independently
                               and adhere to different investment approaches,
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                               typically have distinct portfolios. That's why
                               our funds can be used to build truly diversified
                               allocation plans covering every major asset
                               class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST      At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                               consistently provide investors with exceptional
                               risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                               as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                               that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                               names in financial services.

REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was
originally implemented in October 1997. The Fund's Board of Directors had
discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the six months under review, emerging market equities recorded strong
positive performance, despite volatility in Asia. A sharp sell-off in China's
Shanghai (A shares) stock market in late February triggered widespread selling
that resonated throughout the global markets. Furthermore, investor concerns
about weakness in the U.S. subprime mortgage market and its implications for the
greater economy, as well as currency volatility led to more selling. Although
some investors chose to lock in gains accrued over the past few years, most
concerns proved to be short-lived as investor confidence was restored in the
second half of the reporting period. Many market participants used the
correction as an opportunity to build positions at more attractive prices.

In February, China's A shares market correction preceded the annual National
People's Congress meeting in March against an uncertain backdrop of feverish
growth rates and record high valuations. The government attempted to cool the
economy by tripling the stamp duty paid on share transactions to 0.3%, which
subsequently, in May, led to the Chinese stock market's largest single-day
decline since February. Although both corrections were relatively brief, the
scope of February's adjustment was widespread, whereas May's drop was limited
mostly to Asia. Chinese stocks overcame the volatility and ended the period with
gains as investors remained confident in the country's rapidly growing economy.

China's expansion of the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII)
program that allows domestic fund managers and brokerages to invest in foreign
securities provided a boost to Hong Kong-listed H and Red Chip shares as these
companies were expected to attract significant fund flows from China's domestic
investors.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or

sectors of the economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our
buy decisions. Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary
factor in selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's
current price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

During the six months under review, the Fund benefited from its exposure to the
energy, food and staples retailing, and capital goods sectors. 1

A rebound in oil prices during the reporting period and growing demand for
energy and commodities in China and other emerging markets benefited many of the
Fund's energy sector investments. Among the Fund's most significant contributors
to performance were China Petroleum & Chemical (Sinopec), China's largest
integrated energy company; China Shenhua Energy, China's principal coal
producer; and CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil and natural gas exploration
and production company.

Within food and staples retailing, the Fund's only sector holding was its
investment in Dairy Farm International Holdings, which operates supermarkets,
drugstores, convenience stores and restaurants in Asia. The stock performed well
largely due to greater private consumption in the region. Capital goods
companies that recorded significant price appreciation during the reporting
period included industrial conglomerates Citic Pacific and Shanghai Industrial
Holdings, and China International Marine Containers (Group), the world's largest
manufacturer of marine containers.

In contrast, the insurance; food, beverage and tobacco; and media sectors
detracted from performance. 2 A position in China Life Insurance, the Fund's
only insurance sector investment, was among the most significant detractors from
performance during the reporting period. Lagging results in the food, beverage
and tobacco, and media sectors were largely due to the negative performance of
relatively small holdings in new Fund position Xiwang Sugar Holdings, a leading
glucose manufacturer in China and Next Media, one of the largest
Chinese-language print media companies in Hong Kong. Although increased
competition from free daily publications pressured Next Media's stock price
during the reporting period, we believed the company's growing penetration into
the Taiwan market was positive for its long-term prospects. Our outlook for
Xiwang was also positive at period-end, as we believed the company could benefit
from a rapidly growing food-processing industry that

1. The energy sector comprises oil, gas and consumable fuels in the SOI. The
capital goods sector comprises electrical equipment, industrial conglomerates
and machinery in the SOI.

2. The food, beverage and tobacco sector comprises food products in the SOI.

continues to evolve to keep pace with the changing consumption patterns of a
large domestic market.

Other detractors from performance included several of the Fund's bank holdings
such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Mega Financial Holding and Bank
of China. Our industry outlook was positive at period-end, as we believed
continued liberalization of the financial sector could unlock hidden value and
allow banks to benefit from the growing financial needs of consumers in the
greater China region.

During the review period, the Fund made several major purchases in Hong
Kong-listed Chinese H shares, which we believed were attractively valued and
might benefit from the expanded QDII program. New Fund H share positions
included major commercial banks China Construction Bank and Bank of China;
Dongfeng Motor, one of China's leading automobile manufacturers; and Yanzhou
Coal Mining, a major coal producer in China.

With oil prices expected to remain high, we increased our investments in the oil
and gas exploration and production, and coal and consumable fuels industries. 3
Coupled with growing global energy demand, companies in these industries could
experience higher earnings. Greater demand for consumer products and services
led us to increase our holdings in the automobile manufacturers, integrated
telecommunication services, packaged food and meat, and apparel retail
industries. 4 New Fund positions included China Netcom Group, the dominant
telecommunication services provider in Northern China, and I.T., a major fashion
retail operator in Hong Kong. The Fund also initiated exposure to Cambodia with
an investment in NagaCorp. The company manages and operates the only licensed
casino in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.

During the period, the Fund undertook selective sales in Hong Kong, China Red
Chip shares and the U.K. to realize gains and raise cash for the Fund's dividend
and capital gains distribution. The Fund reduced its positions in China Mobile,
the dominant mobile services provider in China, and Cheung Kong Holdings, a
major property developer in Hong Kong. The Fund significantly reduced its
position in U.K.-based HSBC Holdings, one of the world's largest banking and
financial services organizations.

3. The oil and gas exploration and production industry; and the coal and
consumable fuels industry are part of oil, gas and consumable fuels in the SOI.

4. The automobile manufacturers industry is part of automobiles and auto
components in the SOI. The integrated telecommunication services industry is
part of diversified telecommunication services in the SOI. The packaged food and
meat industry is part of food products in the SOI. The apparel retail industry
is part of specialty retail in the SOI.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements
following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of
country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository
Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements
are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market
proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred. If such an event
occurs, the securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may
include the use of independent pricing services. All security valuation
procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign
securities are recognized as soon as the Fund is notified of the ex-dividend
date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences
are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

At June 30, 2007, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par value).
During the period ended June 30, 2007, 103,212 shares were issued for $2,783,627
from reinvested distributions. During the year ended December 31, 2006, there
were no share transactions.

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Under the program,
the Fund may purchase, from time to time, fund shares in open-market
transactions, at the discretion of management. This authorization remains in
effect. During the period ended June 30, 2007, and the year ended December 31,
2006, there were no share repurchases.

4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of

custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

5. INCOME TAXES

For tax purposes realized currency losses occurring subsequent to October 31,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

5. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

At June 30, 2007, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments ............................................   $520,824,372
                                                                   ============

Unrealized appreciation ........................................   $648,754,838
Unrealized depreciation ........................................     (1,784,318)
                                                                   ------------

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions and passive foreign
investment company shares.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions and passive foreign investment company shares.

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended June 30, 2007, aggregated $91,210,213 and $127,681,775,
respectively.

7. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Franklin Advisers, Inc. (an affiliate of the investment manager). Management
fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep Money Fund, in
an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees paid by the Sweep
Money Fund.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. REORGANIZATION TO A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

10. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares ("marketing support"), Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"),
entered into settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental
entities. Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among
others, concerning market timing and marketing support.

On June 6, 2007, the SEC posted for public comment the proposed plan of
distribution for the market timing settlement. Following the public comment
period, and once the SEC approves the final plan of distribution, disbursements
of settlement monies will be made promptly to individuals who were shareholders
of the designated funds during the relevant period, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the settlement and plan.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above, as well as to allegedly excessive commissions and
advisory and distribution fees.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

11. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), on June 29, 2007. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement,
recognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with
accounting for the related interest and penalties. The Fund has determined that
the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial
statements.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund
believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will have no material impact on its financial
statements.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan, unless he elects to withdraw.
Shareholders holding their shares through Japan Securities Depository Center,
Inc., will not be enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and
they elect to participate. If shares are registered in the name of a
broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the broker-dealer or
nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the shareholder's behalf unless
the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless the reinvestment service is
not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for a
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attention:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares on the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held February 27, 2007, the Board of Directors (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Directors, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (Fund). In
reaching this decision, the Board took into account information furnished
throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information prepared
specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process. Information
furnished and discussed throughout the year included investment performance
reports on the Fund, information on its share price discount to net asset value,
and other related financial information, as well as periodic reports on legal,
compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and other services
provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates. Information
furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process included a report
prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent organization, as well as a
Fund profitability analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper report
compared the Fund's investment performance and expenses with those of other
funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund
profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton
Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual
fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis report was
information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and other
accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by the
Manager and its affiliates including management's explanation of differences
where relevant, and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a
memorandum prepared by management describing project initiatives and capital
investments relating to the services provided to the Funds by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Directors received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Directors, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's continuous
efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery

procedures to function in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted that
such systems and procedures had functioned smoothly during the Florida
hurricanes and blackouts experienced in recent years. Among other factors taken
into account by the Board were the Manager's best execution trading policies,
including a favorable report by an independent portfolio trading analytical
firm. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's portfolio
management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of the level of a portfolio manager's bonus
compensation was the relative investment performance of the funds he or she
managed and that a portion of such bonus was required to be invested in a
predesignated list of funds within such person's fund management area so as to
be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement renewal.
The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment performance during
2006 and the previous 10 years ended December 31, 2006, in comparison with a
six-fund performance universe consisting of the Fund and all other non-leveraged
closed-end Pacific region funds as selected by Lipper. Such report considers
total return on a net asset value basis without regard to market discounts or
premiums to accurately reflect investment performance. The Lipper report showed
the Fund's total return for 2006 was the second highest of such group, and its
total return on an annualized basis was the highest in such group during each of
the previous three-, five- and 10-year periods.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a Lipper report analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with those of a
group of four other funds selected by Lipper as its appropriate Lipper expense
group. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a survey showing
that the scope of services covered under the Fund's investment management
agreement was similar to those provided by fund managers to other fund groups.
In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was given to the Fund's contractual
investment management fee rate in comparison with the contractual investment
management fee rate that would have been charged by other funds within its
Lipper expense group assuming they were similar in size to the Fund, as well as
the actual total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison with those of such
expense group. The Lipper management effective fee analysis considers
administrative fees to be part of management fees and the results of such
expense comparisons showed the Fund's contractual investment management fee rate
to be the highest in its expense group, and the Fund's actual total expense
ratio to be the second highest in such Lipper expense group. The Board found
such expenses to be acceptable in light of the Fund's investment performance,
noting that the Fund's total expense ratio was within 20 basis points of the
median of its Lipper expense group.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund. Specific attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating
costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are
inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, the allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations made in prior years and that the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been engaged by the
Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial basis, specified and
approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their purposes and use
in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing and discussing such
analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in
establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of fund operations
conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully reflected in the
expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its profitability, as well as the
fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by management. In addition, the Board
considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the Manager's
parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers broken
down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of distribution
expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses. The Board
also considered the extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive
ancillary benefits from fund operations, as well as potential benefits resulting
from allocation of fund brokerage and the use of "soft" commission dollars to
pay for research. Based upon its consideration of all these factors, the Board
determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates
from providing services to the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature,
quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
Manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders and intends to monitor
future growth of the Fund accordingly. The Board noted at the end of 2006 the
Fund's net assets were slightly in excess of $1 billion and that it had recently
added a breakpoint to the Fund's investment advisory fee at the $1 billion
level.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
        CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
will refer the matter, along with the recommended course of action by the
manager to an interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include
portfolio managers and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for
evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the
voting recommendation of ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third
party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with a
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. Where the Proxy Review Committee
refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board of directors or a committee of the
board.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the ISS quantitative model utilized to assess such plans
and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

There have been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and
