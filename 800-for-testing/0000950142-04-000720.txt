                          Independent Auditors' Report
                          ----------------------------

The Trustees and Shareholders of
Taiwan Greater China Fund:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and
liabilities of the Taiwan Greater China Fund, a Massachusetts business trust
(the "Trust"), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of
December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statement of operations for the
year then ended, the consolidated statements of changes in net assets for each
of the years in the two-year period then ended, and the consolidated financial
highlights for each of the years in the five-year period then ended. These
consolidated financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and financial
highlights. Our procedures included physical inspection or confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2003, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Taiwan Greater China Fund as of December 31, 2003, the
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(e)(1)  AUDIT COMMITTEE'S PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In accordance with paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, the
audit committee of the registrant's board of trustees approves the engagement of
the registrant's accountants before such accountants are engaged to render audit
or non-audit services. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X, the registrant's audit committee also pre-approves its
independent accountants' engagements for non-audit services with the
registrant's investment adviser, its parent company, and any entity controlled
by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing
services to the registrant, if such engagement relates directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the registrant.

(e)(2)  PERCENTAGE OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

All services described in each of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this Item 4 were
pre-approved before the engagement by the registrant's audit committee pursuant
to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. Consequently, none of
such services were required to be approved by the audit committee pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

(f) Not applicable.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) The fees paid by the registrant's investment adviser to the registrant's
principal accountant that are listed in sub-item (g) of this Item 4 related
solely to applications for distributing fund status on behalf of other, non-U.S.
funds managed by the registrant's investment adviser, and hence were not fees
that in any way relate to the operations and financial reporting of the
registrant. Therefore, such fees were not fees subject to approval pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X and were not submitted for
pre-approval by the registrant's audit committee.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

                            TAIWAN GREATER CHINA FUND

                            OFFICERS' CODE OF ETHICS



         I.       COVERED OFFICERS; PURPOSE OF THE CODE

                  This code of ethics (this "Code") for the Taiwan Greater China
Fund (the "Trust") applies to the Trust's chief executive officer and chief
financial officer (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships;

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that the Trust files with or submits to
                  the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Trust;

         o        compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;

         o        the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in this Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to this Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or
apparent conflicts of interest.


         II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
                  OF INTEREST ETHICALLY

                  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
Trust. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer or a
member of his or her family received improper personal benefits as a result of
his or her position with the Trust or its investment adviser.

                  Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships
between Covered Officers and the Trust and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers
Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with
the Trust because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Trust. The
Trust's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are
designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions.
This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those programs and
procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

                  Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Trust and its investment adviser, of which the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes
that the Covered Officers will, in the

<PAGE>

normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Trust or for its
adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the Trust and its adviser. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationship between the Trust and the adviser and is consistent
with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the
Trust. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment
Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to
have been handled ethically.

                  Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code even if
those conflicts are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and
the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts
of interest under this Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Trust.

                  Each Covered Officer must:

         o        not use his or her personal influence or personal
                  relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
                  financial reporting by the Trust whereby the Covered Officer
                  would benefit personally;

         o        not cause the Trust to take action, or fail to take action,
                  for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer
                  rather than the benefit the Trust; and

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                  employee of the Trust or their affiliated persons for reports
                  of potential violations that are made in good faith.

                  There are some conflict of interest situations that should
always be discussed with the chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust's
Board of Trustees (the "Board"). Examples of these include:

         o        service as a director on the board of any public company;

         o        the receipt of any non-nominal gift;

         o        the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                  the Trust has current or prospective business dealings unless
                  such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate as to time and place and not so frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

         o        an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Trust's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                  administrator or any of their affiliated persons; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Trust for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or purchasing its shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

<PAGE>

         III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
                  disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Trust.

         o        Covered Officers must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Trust to others,
                  whether within or outside the Trust, including to the Trust's
                  trustees and auditors, governmental regulators and
                  self-regulatory organizations.

         o        Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his or her area of responsibility, consult with other officers
                  and employees of the Trust and its investment adviser with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents that
                  the Trust files with or submits to the SEC and in the Trust's
                  other public communications.

         o        It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.


         IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

                  Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of this Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer) affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he or she has received, read and understands this Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has
                  complied with the requirements of this Code;

         o        report at least annually categories of affiliations or other
                  relationships related to conflicts of interest that the
                  Trust's Directors and Officers Questionnaire covers; and

         o        notify the chairman of the Board's Audit Committee promptly if
                  he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
                  so is itself a violation of this Code.

                  The chairman of the Trust's Audit Committee is responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.
However, any approvals or waivers sought by a Covered Officer will also be
reported to and considered by the Audit Committee as a whole. The chairman of
the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee as a whole will take such actions as
they deem appropriate in response to any question concerning, or violation of,
this Code that comes to their attention.


         V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                  This Code is the sole code of ethics adopted by the Trust for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies under that Act. Insofar as
other policies or procedures

<PAGE>

of the Trust or the Trust's investment adviser, principal underwriter or other
service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the
Covered Officers, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Trust's and its
investment adviser's codes of ethics under rule 17j-1 under the Investment
Company Act and any more detailed policies and procedures set forth in the
adviser's code of ethics or compliance manual are separate requirements applying
to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.


         VI.      AMENDMENTS

                  Any amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a
majority vote of the Board.


         VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

                  All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to
this Code shall be considered confidential and be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than members of the Audit Committee,
other members of the Board, counsel to the Board or the Audit Committee and the
Trust's investment adviser.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

SUMMARY

The following is a condensed version of all proxy voting recommendations
contained in The ISS Proxy Voting Manual.

1.       OPERATIONAL ITEMS

ADJOURN MEETING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to provide management with the authority to
adjourn an annual or special meeting absent compelling reasons to support the
proposal.

AMEND QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings
below a majority of the shares outstanding unless there are compelling reasons
to support the proposal.

AMEND MINOR BYLAWS

Vote FOR bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (updates or
corrections).

CHANGE COMPANY NAME

Vote FOR proposals to change the corporate name.

CHANGE DATE, TIME, OR LOCATION OF ANNUAL MEETING

Vote FOR management proposals to change the date/time/location of the annual
meeting unless the proposed change is unreasonable.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to change the date/time/location of the
annual meeting unless the current scheduling or location is unreasonable.

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

o        an auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company,
         and is therefore not independent

o        Fees for non-audit services are excessive, or

o        There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an
         opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
         financial position.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for audit firm rotation,
taking into account the tenure of the audit firm, the length of rotation
specified in the proposal, any significant audit-related issues at the company,
and whether the company has a periodic renewal process where the auditor is
evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price.

TRANSACT OTHER BUSINESS

Vote AGAINST proposals to approve other business when it appears as a voting
item.

<PAGE>

2.       BOARD OF DIRECTORS

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS

Votes on director nominees should be made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, examining the
following factors: composition of the board and key board committees, attendance
at board meetings, corporate governance provisions and takeover activity,
long-term company performance relative to a market index, directors' investment
in the company, whether the chairman is also serving as CEO, and whether a
retired CEO sits on the board.

However, there are some actions by directors that should result in votes being
WITHHELD. These instances include directors who:

o        Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without
         a valid excuse

o        Implement or renew a dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill

o        Ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of the
         shares outstanding

o        Ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of the
         votes cast for two consecutive years

o        Failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the shareholders
         tendered their shares

o        Are inside directors or affiliated outsiders and sit on the audit,
         compensation, or nominating committees

o        Are inside directors or affiliated outsiders and the full board serves
         as the audit, compensation, or nominating committee or the company does
         not have one of these committees

o        Are audit committee members and the non-audit fees paid to the auditor
         are excessive.

o        Are inside directors or affiliated outside directors and the full board
         is less than majority independent o Sit on more than six boards

o        Are members of a compensation committee that has allowed a
         pay-for-performance disconnect as described in Section 8 (Executive and
         Director Compensation).

In addition, directors who enacted egregious corporate governance policies or
failed to replace management as appropriate would be subject to recommendations
to WITHHOLD votes.

AGE LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors either through term limits or mandatory retirement ages.

BOARD SIZE

Vote FOR proposals seeking to fix the board size or designate a range for the
board size.

Vote AGAINST proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the
board outside of a specified range without shareholder approval.

CLASSIFICATION/DECLASSIFICATION OF THE BOARD

Vote AGAINST proposals to classify the board.

Vote FOR proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors
annually.

<PAGE>

CUMULATIVE VOTING

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.

Vote proposals to restore or permit cumulative voting on a CASE-BY-CASE basis
relative to the company's other governance provisions.

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY PROTECTION

Proposals on director and officer indemnification and liability protection
should be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, using Delaware law as the standard.

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability
for monetary damages for violating the duty of care.

Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just
legal expenses to actions, such as negligence, that are more serious violations
of fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness.

Vote FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the following
apply:

o        The director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner that
         he reasonably believed was in the best interests of the company, and

o        Only if the director's legal expenses would be covered.

ESTABLISH/AMEND NOMINEE QUALIFICATIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals that establish or amend director qualifications.
Votes should be based on how reasonable the criteria are and to what degree they
may preclude dissident nominees from joining the board.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring two candidates per board seat.

FILLING VACANCIES/REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

Vote AGAINST proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for
cause.

Vote FOR proposals to restore shareholder ability to remove directors with or
without cause.

Vote AGAINST proposals that provide that only continuing directors may elect
replacements to fill board vacancies.

Vote FOR proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board
vacancies.

INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN (SEPARATE CHAIRMAN/CEO)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring the position of
chairman be filled by an independent director unless there are compelling
reasons to recommend against the proposal, such as a counterbalancing governance
structure. This should include all of the following:

o        Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
         members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties

o        Two-thirds independent board

o        All-independent key committees

o        Established governance guidelines.

<PAGE>

MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be
independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by
ISS's definition of independence.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or
nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors if they
currently do not meet that standard.

OPEN ACCESS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for open access taking into
account the ownership threshold specified in the proposal and the proponent's
rationale for targeting the company in terms of board and director conduct.

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum
amount of stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to
remain on the board. While ISS favors stock ownership on the part of directors,
the company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE shareholder proposals asking that the company adopt a holding
or retention period for its executives (for holding stock after the vesting or
exercise of equity awards), taking into account any stock ownership requirements
or holding period/retention ratio already in place and the actual ownership
level of executives.

TERM LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors either through term limits or mandatory retirement ages.

3.       PROXY CONTESTS

VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS
Votes in a contested election of directors must be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, considering the following factors:

o        Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
         industry

o        Management's track record

o        Background to the proxy contest

o        Qualifications of director nominees (both slates)

o        Evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders as well as the
         likelihood that the proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock
         ownership positions.

REIMBURSING PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

Voting to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses should be analyzed on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. In cases where ISS recommends in favor of the dissidents, we
also recommend voting for reimbursing proxy solicitation expenses.

<PAGE>

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that corporations adopt confidential
voting, use independent vote tabulators and use independent inspectors of
election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy contests as
follows:

In the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to request
that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the dissidents
agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents will not agree, the
confidential voting policy is waived.
Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

4.       ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES AND VOTING RELATED ISSUES
         ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS/NOMINATIONS

Votes on advance notice proposals are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, giving
support to those proposals that allow shareholders to submit proposals as close
to the meeting date as reasonably possible and within the broadest window
possible.

AMEND BYLAWS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.

Vote FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
to shareholders.

POISON PILLS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that any future pill be put to a
shareholder vote.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take
action by written consent.

Vote FOR proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written
consent.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

special meetings.

independently of management.

appraisal.

increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond the allowable increase when a
company's shares are in danger of being delisted or if a company's ability to
continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.

DUAL-CLASS STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or subvoting common stock

current shareholders O It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an
insider or significant shareholder

ISSUE STOCK FOR USE WITH RIGHTS PLAN

Vote AGAINST proposals that increase authorized common stock for the explicit
purpose of implementing a shareholder rights plan (poison pill).

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

Review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis shareholder proposals that seek preemptive
rights. In evaluating proposals on preemptive rights, consider the size of a
company, the characteristics of its shareholder base, and the liquidity of the
stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred
shares after analyzing the number of preferred shares available for issue given
a company's industry and performance in terms of shareholder returns.

RECAPITALIZATION

Votes CASE-BY-CASE on recapitalizations (reclassifications of securities),
taking into account the following: more simplified capital structure, enhanced
liquidity, fairness of conversion terms, impact on voting power and dividends,
reasons for the reclassification, conflicts of interest, and other alternatives
considered.

<PAGE>

REVERSE STOCK SPLITS

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split when the number
of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced.

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split to avoid
delisting.

Votes on proposals to implement a reverse stock split that do not
proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized for issue should be
determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a model developed by ISS.

Vote FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans in
which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

STOCK DISTRIBUTIONS: SPLITS AND DIVIDENDS

Vote FOR management proposals to increase the common share authorization for a
stock split or share dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares
would not result in an excessive number of shares available for issuance as
determined using a model developed by ISS.

TRACKING STOCK

Votes on the creation of tracking stock are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis,
weighing the strategic value of the transaction against such factors as: adverse
governance changes, excessive increases in authorized capital stock, unfair
method of distribution, diminution of voting rights, adverse conversion
features, negative impact on stock option plans, and other alternatives such as
spinoff.

8.       EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Votes with respect to equity-based compensation plans should be determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. Our methodology for reviewing compensation plans primarily
focuses on the transfer of shareholder wealth (the dollar cost of pay plans to
shareholders instead of simply focusing on voting power dilution). Using the
expanded compensation data disclosed under the SEC's rules, ISS will value every
award type. ISS will include in its analyses an estimated dollar cost for the
proposed plan and all continuing plans. This cost, dilution to shareholders'
equity, will also be expressed as a percentage figure for the transfer of
shareholder wealth, and will be considered along with dilution to voting power.
Once ISS determines the estimated cost of the plan, we compare it to a company
specific dilution cap.

Our model determines a company-specific allowable pool of shareholder wealth
that may be transferred from the company to plan participants, adjusted for: O
Long-term corporate performance (on an absolute basis and relative to a standard
industry peer group and an appropriate market index),

o        Cash compensation, and

o        Categorization of the company as emerging, growth, or mature.

These adjustments are pegged to market capitalization.

Vote AGAINST plans that expressly permit the repricing of underwater stock
options without shareholder approval.

<PAGE>

Generally vote AGAINST plans in which the CEO participates if there is a
disconnect between the CEO's pay and company performance (an increase in pay and
a decrease in performance) and the main source of the pay increase (over half)
is equity-based. A decrease in performance is based on negative one- and
three-year total shareholder returns. An increase in pay is based on the CEO's
total direct compensation (salary, cash bonus, present value of stock options,
face value of restricted stock, face value of longterm incentive plan payouts,
and all other compensation) increasing over the previous year. Also WITHHOLD
votes from the Compensation Committee members.

         the outstanding shares

Vote AGAINST employee stock purchase plans where any of the following apply:

         the outstanding shares

INCENTIVE BONUS PLANS AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSALS (OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION
PROPOSALS)

Vote FOR proposals that simply amend shareholder-approved compensation plans to
include administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one
participant may receive to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m).

Vote FOR proposals to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) unless they are clearly
inappropriate.

favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section 162(m) should be
considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a proprietary, quantitative model
developed by ISS.

Generally vote FOR cash or cash and stock bonus plans that are submitted to
shareholders for the purpose of exempting compensation from taxes under the
provisions of Section 162(m) if no increase in shares is requested.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)

Vote FOR proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized shares for
existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive
(more than five percent of outstanding shares.)

401(K) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS REGARDING EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director pay information, provided the information requested is

options, unless the company has already publicly committed to expensing options
by a specific date.

<PAGE>

PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK OPTIONS

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based
stock options (indexed, premium-priced, and performance-vested options), unless:

o        The proposal is overly restrictive (e.g., it mandates that awards to
         all employees must be performance-based or all awards to top executives
         must be a particular type, such as indexed options)

o        The company demonstrates that it is using a substantial portion of
         performance-based awards for its top executives

proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment
contracts.

An acceptable parachute should include the following:

o        The parachute should be less attractive than an ongoing employment
         opportunity with the firm

o        The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management

o        The amount should not exceed three times base salary plus guaranteed
         benefits

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals to exclude pension plan income in the
calculation of earnings used in determining executive bonuses/compensation.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS (SERPS)

9.       SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

CONSUMER ISSUES AND PUBLIC SAFETY

ANIMAL RIGHTS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to phase out the use of animals in product
testing, taking into account:

o        The nature of the product and the degree that animal testing is
         necessary or federally mandated (such as medical products),

o        The availability and feasibility of alternatives to animal testing to
         ensure product safety, and

o        The degree that competitors are using animal- free testing.

Generally vote FOR proposals seeking a report on the company's animal
welfare standards unless:

o        The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and
         monitors compliance

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking the company to implement price restraints
on pharmaceutical products, taking into account:

<PAGE>

o        Whether the proposal focuses on a specific drug and region

o        Whether the economic benefits of providing subsidized drugs (e.g.,
         public goodwill) outweigh the costs in terms of reduced profits, lower
         R&D spending, and harm to competitiveness

o        The extent that reduced prices can be offset through the company's
         marketing budget without affecting R&D spending

o        Whether the company already limits price increases of its products

o        Whether the company already contributes life-saving pharmaceuticals to
         the needy and Third World countries

o        The extent that peer companies implement price restraints

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

Vote AGAINST proposals asking companies to voluntarily label genetically
engineered (GE) ingredients in their products or alternatively to provide
interim labeling and eventually eliminate GE ingredients due to the costs and
feasibility of labeling and/or phasing out the use of GE ingredients.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for a report on the feasibility of
labeling products containing GE ingredients taking into account:

o        The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and
         the proportion of it affected by the resolution

o        The quality of the company's disclosure on GE product labeling and
         related voluntary initiatives and how this disclosure compares with
         peer company disclosure

o        Company's current disclosure on the feasibility of GE product labeling,
         including information on the related costs

o        Any voluntary labeling initiatives undertaken or considered by the

         the proportion of it affected by the resolution

o        The quality of the company's disclosure on risks related to GE product
         use and how this disclosure compares with peer company disclosure

o        The percentage of revenue derived from international operations,
         particularly in Europe, where GE products are more regulated and
         consumer backlash is more pronounced.

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking a report on the health and environmental effects
of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Health studies of this sort are better
undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the company's
products or proposals asking for reports outlining the steps necessary to
eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to federal regulators) that outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.

<PAGE>

HANDGUNS

         tobacco-related liabilities.

Spinoff tobacco-related businesses:

o        The percentage of the company's business affected

o        The feasibility of a spinoff

o        Potential future liabilities related to the company's tobacco business.

Stronger product warnings:

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking stronger product warnings. Such decisions are
better left to public health authorities.

Investment in tobacco stocks:

Vote AGAINST proposals prohibiting investment in tobacco equities. Such
decisions are better left to portfolio managers.

Generally vote FOR requests for reports disclosing the company's environmental
policies unless it already has well-documented environmental management systems
that are available to the public.

GLOBAL WARMING

Generally vote FOR reports on the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the

company's current environmental disclosure and reporting or is not integral to
the company's line of business. However, additional reporting may be warranted
if:

o        The company's level of disclosure lags that of its competitors, or

o        The costs of implementation

o        The company's initiatives to address climate change

Generally vote FOR requests for reports on the feasibility of developing
renewable energy sources, unless the report is duplicative of the company's
current environmental disclosure and reporting or is not integral to the
company's line of business.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on its policies
and practices related to social, environmental, and economic sustainability,
unless the company is already reporting on its sustainability initiatives
through existing reports such as:

o        A combination of an EHS or other environmental report, code of conduct,
         and/or supplier/vendor standards, and equal opportunity and diversity
         data and programs, all of which are publicly available, or

o        A report based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or similar
         guidelines.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking companies to provide a sustainability

GENERAL CORPORATE ISSUES

LINK EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO SOCIAL PERFORMANCE

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to review ways of linking executive compensation
to social factors, such as corporate downsizings, customer or employee
satisfaction, community involvement, human rights, environmental performance,
predatory lending, and executive/employee pay disparities. Such resolutions
should be evaluated in the context of:

o        The relevance of the issue to be linked to pay

o        The degree that social performance is already included in the company's
         pay structure and disclosed

o        The degree that social performance is used by peer companies in setting
         pay

o        Violations or complaints filed against the company relating to the
         particular social performance measure

o        Artificial limits sought by the proposal, such as freezing or capping

o        Current company pay levels.

CHARITABLE/POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking the company to affirm political

o        The company has procedures in place to ensure that employee
         contributions to company-sponsored political action committees (PACs)
         are strictly voluntary and not coercive.

Vote AGAINST proposals to report or publish in newspapers the company's
political contributions. Federal and state laws restrict the amount of corporate
contributions and include reporting requirements.

Vote AGAINST proposals disallowing the company from making political
contributions. Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and
local level and barring contributions can put the company at a competitive
disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals restricting the company from making charitable
contributions. Charitable contributions are generally useful for assisting
worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill in the community. In the absence of
bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management should determine which
contributions are in the best interests of the company.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have prior
government service and whether such service had a bearing on the business of the
company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without providing any
meaningful information to shareholders.

o        There are serious controversies surrounding the company's China
         operations, and

         requirements

o        The cost and feasibility of adopting all nine principles

o        The cost of duplicating efforts to follow two sets of standards (Fair
         Employment and the MacBride Principles)

<PAGE>

o        The potential for charges of reverse discrimination

o        The potential that any company sales or contracts in the rest of the
         United Kingdom could be negatively impacted

o        The level of the company's investment in Northern Ireland

o        The number of company employees in Northern Ireland

components and delivery systems, including disengaging from current and proposed
contracts. Components and delivery systems serve multiple military and
non-military uses, and withdrawal from these contracts could have a negative
impact on the company's business.
