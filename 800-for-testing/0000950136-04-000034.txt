(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained
under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not
reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period greater
than one year represents the average annual total return. Total return for a
period of less than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the current annualized per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share at
October 31, 2003.

(1) Inclusive of net assets to attributable Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker commissions
or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one year represents the
average annual total return. Total return for a period of less than one year is
not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at October 31, 2003.

(1)Inclusive of net assets to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker commissions
or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one year represents the
average annual total return. Total return for a period for less than one year is
not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at October 31, 2003.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
October 31, 2003 (unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal Income Fund ("Municipal"), PIMCO California Municipal Income
Fund ("California Municipal") and PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund ("New
York Municipal"), collectively referred to as the "Funds", were organized as
Massachusetts business trusts on May 10, 2001. Prior to commencing operations
on June 29, 2001, the Funds had no operations other than matters relating to
their organization and registration as non-diversified, closed-end management
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of
6,667 shares of beneficial interest of each Fund at an aggregate purchase price
of $100,005 per Fund to Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P.,
("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"), serves
as the Fund's Investment Manager and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
ADAM. ADAM is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds
have an unlimited amount of no par value common stock authorized.

Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal
bonds, the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes. California
Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which pay
interest that is exempt from federal and California state income taxes. New
York Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which
pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York state and New York City
income taxes. The Funds will seek to avoid bonds generating interest income
which could potentially subject individuals to alternative minimum tax. The
issuers' abilities to meet their obligations may be affected by economic and
political developments in a specific state or region.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Funds'
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have
not yet occurred. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

(A) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
The Funds determine their net asset value at the close of regular trading
(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on
each day the NYSE is open. Debt securities are valued by an independent pricing
service approved by the Board of Trustees. Any security or other asset for
which market quotations are not readily available is valued as determined in
good faith under procedures established by the Board of Trustees. Short-term
investments having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

(B) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized daily to non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(C) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Funds intend to distribute all of their taxable income and to comply with
the other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
substantially all of their taxable ordinary income and long-term capital gains,
if any, during each calendar year, the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.
federal excise tax.

(D) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Funds declare dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. Each Fund records dividends and distributions to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either
considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
the capital accounts based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or
distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal
income tax purposes, they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of
paid-in capital.

(E) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Funds are required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value
at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation
recorded is simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involve
the risk of an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures
contracts, interest rates and the underlying hedged assets, and the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(F) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
For hedging purposes, the Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options on municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements,
indexes or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or
other exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities.

The cost of securities acquired through the exercise of call options is
increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds from the securities sold through
the exercise of put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a
put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an option
written could result in the Funds purchasing a security at a price different
from the current market price.

(G) RESIDUAL INTEREST MUNICIPAL BONDS (RIBS)
The Funds invest in Residual Interest Municipal Bonds ("RIBS") whose interest
rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or
the value of an index, RIBS are created by dividing the income stream provided
by the underlying bonds to create two securities, one short-term and one
long-term. The interest rate on the short-term component is reset by an index
or auction process normally every seven to 35 days. After income is paid on the
short-term securities at current rates, the residual income from the underlying
bond(s) goes to the long-term securities. Therefore, rising short-term interest
rates result in lower income for the longer-term portion, and vice versa. The
longer-term bonds may be more volatile and less liquid than other Municipal
Bonds of comparable maturity. An investment in RIBS typically will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

(H) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Funds benefit from an expense offset arrangement with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
and accounting agent expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income
producing securities, they would have generated income for the Funds.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the
"Agreements") with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to
each Fund. Subject to the supervision of each Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through
others selected by it, the investment activities of each Fund and the Fund's
business affairs and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,
the Investment Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly, at the annual
rate of 0.65% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order to
reduce Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to
reimburse each Fund for fees and expenses at the annual rate of 0.20% of the
Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding) from the commencement of operations
through June 30, 2006, and for a declining amount thereafter through June 30,
2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage each Fund's investments.
Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all
investment decisions with respect to each Fund's assets. The Investment Manager
(not the Funds) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in
return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.37% of each Fund's
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding). The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of the fees it is entitled to receive from the Investment
Manager, such that the Sub-Adviser will receive 0.25% of each Fund's average
daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred shares
that may be outstanding) from the commencement of the Funds' operations through
June 30, 2006, and will receive an increasing amount (not to exceed 0.37% of
each Fund's average daily net assets, including net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through June 30, 2009. The
Investment Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser $671,361,
$496,835 and $201,565 in connection with sub-advisory services for Municipal,
California Municipal and New York Municipal, respectively, for the six months
ended October 31, 2003.

The Funds are subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Funds from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation
value.

the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on
any matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

(1)   Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
      at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current
      market price on the last day of each period reported. Dividends and
      distributions are assumed, for purposes of this calculation, to be
      reinvested at prices obtained under the Funds' dividend reinvestment
      plan. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage commissions or
      sales charges. Total investment return for a period of less than one year
      is not annualized.
(2)   Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common
      and preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common
      shareholders.
(3)   Inclusive of expenses offset by custody credits earned on cash balances
      at custodian bank. (See note 1(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).
(4)   Annualized.
(5)   During the periods indicated above the Investment Manager waived a
      portion of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in
      effect, the ratio of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets would have been 1.34%
      (annualized) and 8.06% (annualized), respectively, for the six months
      ended October 31, 2003, 1.32% and 7.89%, respectively for the year ended
      April 30, 2003 and 1.21% (annualized) and 7.34% (annualized),
      respectively, for the period June 29, 2001 (commencement of operations)
      through April 30, 2002.
