                 Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

                                 June 30, 2008

1. ORGANIZATION

SEI Structured Credit Fund, LP (the "Fund") is a Delaware limited partnership
established on June 26, 2007. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") as a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund offers limited
partnership interest ("Interests") of the Fund solely through private placement
transactions to investors ("limited partners") that have signed an investment
management agreement with SEI Investments Management Corporation ("SIMC" or the
"Adviser"), the investment adviser to the Fund. As of June 30, 2008, SEI
Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio owned 46% of the Fund; while the
remaining shareholders owned 54% of the Fund.

The Fund's objective is to seek to generate high total returns. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its objective. The Fund pursues its
investment objective by investing in a portfolio comprised of collateralized
debt obligations ("CDOs") and other structured credit investments. CDOs involve
special purpose investment vehicles formed to acquire and manage a pool of
loans, bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various types. The CDO funds
its investments by issuing several classes of securities, the repayment of which
is linked to the performance of the underlying assets, which serve as collateral
for certain securities issued by the CDO. In addition to CDOs, the Fund's
investments may include fixed income securities, loan participations,
credit-linked notes, medium term notes, registered and unregistered investment
companies or pooled investment vehicles, and derivative instruments, such as
credit default swaps and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, "Structured
Credit Investments").

SEI Investment Strategies, LLC (the "General Partner"), a Delaware limited
liability company, serves as the General Partner to the Fund and has no
investment in the Fund as of June 30, 2008. The General Partner has delegated
the management and control of the business and affairs of the Fund to the Board
of Directors (the "Board"). A majority of the Board is and will be persons who
are not "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) with respect to the
Fund.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
the Fund's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual
results could differ from these estimates.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

CDOs and other Structured Credit Investments are priced based upon valuations
provided by independent, third-party pricing agents, if available. Such values
generally reflect the last reported sales price if the security is actively
traded. The third-party pricing agents may also value structured credit
investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize
actual market transactions, broker-supplied valuations, or other methodologies
designed to identify the market value for such securities. Such methodologies
generally consider such factors as security prices, yields, maturities, call
features, ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving
at valuations.

If a price for a CDO or other structured credit investment cannot be obtained
from an independent, third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall seek to obtain a
bid price from at least one independent broker. In such cases, it is possible
that the independent broker providing the price on the CDO or structured credit
investment is also a market maker, and in many cases the only market maker, with
respect to that security.

Securities listed on a securities exchange, market or automated quotation system
for which quotations are readily available (except for securities traded on
NASDAQ) are valued at the last quoted sale price on the primary exchange or
market (foreign or domestic) on which they are traded, or, if there is no such
reported sale, at the most recent quoted bid price. For securities traded on
NASDAQ, the NASDAQ Official Closing Price will be used. The prices of foreign
securities are reported in local currency and converted to U.S. dollars using
currency exchange rates. Debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty
days or less may be valued at their amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

Securities for which market prices are not "readily available" or may be
unreliable are valued in accordance with Fair Value Procedures established by
the Board. The Fund's Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair Value
Committee (the "Committee") designated by the Board. When a security is valued
in accordance with the Fair Value Procedures, the Committee will determine the
value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available
to the Committee. Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the facts
giving rise to the need to fair value, the last trade price, the performance of
the market or of the issuer's industry, the liquidity of the security, the size
of the holding in the Fund, or any other appropriate information. The
determination of a security's fair value price often involves the consideration
of a number of subjective factors, and is therefore subject to the unavoidable
risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the
security's value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was
readily available.

Certain Structured Credit Investments may be structured as private investment
partnerships. Traditionally, a trading market for holdings of this type does not
exist. As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in such a
private investment fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonable
expect to receive from the private investment fund if the Fund's interest were
redeemed at the time of valuation, determined based on information reasonably
available at the time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be
reliable. Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Fund's procedures,
the fair value of the Fund's interest in a private investment fund shall be the
value attributed to such interest, as of that time of valuation, as reported to
the Fund by the private investment fund's manager, administrator, or other
designed agent. Such a valuation may be a preliminary valuation and, therefore,
may be later revised or adjusted by the private investment fund. Such adjustment
or revision will have no affect on the Fund's net asset value as of any prior
valuation time. As a practical matter, the Adviser and the Board have little or
no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private
investment funds. As a result, information available to the Fund concerning the
value of such investments may not reflect market prices or quotations for the
underlying assets. In the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not
report a value to the Fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by
independent pricing agents of the Fund, the Fund would determine the fair value
of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the
private

investment fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the time
the Fund values its portfolio.

The Board will periodically review the Fund's valuation policies and will update
them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which the
Fund invests.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("FAS 157"), is effective for the Fund's
financial statements issued after December 31, 2007. In accordance with FAS 157,
fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive upon selling an
investment in a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or
most advantageous market of the investment. FAS 157 established a three-tier
hierarchy to maximize the use of the observable market data and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of the fair value
measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset. Inputs may be observable
or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based
on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own
assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances.

The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad Levels
listed below:

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.)
Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions
in determining the fair value of investments)

The valuation techniques used by the Fund to measure fair value in accordance
with FAS 157 during the six months ended June 30, 2008 maximized the use of
observable inputs and minimized the use of unobservable inputs.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial
instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, approximates the carrying
amounts presented on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Management of the
Partnership deems these estimates reasonable.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Costs used in determining
net realized capital gains and losses on the sale of securities are on the basis
of specific identification. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend
date, and interest income is recognized using the accrual basis of accounting.
Amortization and accretion is calculated using the scientific interest method,
which approximates the effective interest method over the holding period of the
security. Amortization of premiums and discounts is included in interest income.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

The Fund invests in CDOs which include collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs")
and other similarly structured securities. CLOs are a type of asset-backed
securities. A CLO is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which
may include, among others, domestic and foreign senior secured loans, senior
unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans, including loans that may be
rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans. CDOs may charge
management fees and administrative expenses. For CDOs, the cashflows from the
trust are split into two or more portions, called tranches, varying in risk and
yield. The riskiest portion is the "equity" tranche which bears the bulk of
defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other,
more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances.
Since it is partially protected from defaults, a senior tranche from a CDO trust
typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities,
and can be rated investment grade. Despite the protection from the equity
tranche, CDO tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults,
increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of
protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults, as well as aversion to CDO
securities as a class.

The risks of an investment in a CDO depend largely on the type of the collateral
securities and the class of the CDO in which the Fund invests. Normally, CLOs
and other CDOs are privately offered and sold, and thus, are not registered
under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized
by the Fund as illiquid securities; however, an active dealer market may exist
for CDOs, allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions. In addition to
the normal risks associated with fixed income securities (e.g., interest rate
risk and default risk), CDOs carry additional risks including, but are not
limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral

securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the
quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) the Funds may
invest in CDOs that are subordinate to other classes; and (iv) the complex
structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment
and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.

FEDERAL TAXES

The Fund's taxable income or loss is reported by the limited partners
individually. The liability for payment of federal and state income tax on the
Fund's earnings is the responsibility of its partners, rather than that of the
Fund. Accordingly, no provision on liability for U.S. federal income taxes has
been recorded in the financial statements.

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
INTERPRETATION NO. 48, "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES" ("FIN 48")
upon commencement of operations on August 1, 2007. Based on its analysis,
management has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have a material
impact to the Funds' financial statements upon adoption. However, managements
conclusions regarding FIN 48 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later
date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation and
guidance expected from the FASB, and on-going analyses of and changes to tax
laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING COSTS

Costs incurred in connection with the organization of the Fund were expensed as
incurred. Initial offering costs have been deferred and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the first twelve months of the Fund's operations.
Unamortized offering costs at June 30, 2008, were $5,669.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, since
inception the Fund has not had claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and
expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

RESTRICTED SECURITIES

At June 30, 2008, the Fund owned private placement investment that was purchased
through private offerings or acquired through initial public offerings and
cannot be sold without prior registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or
pursuant to an exemption therefrom. In addition, the Fund has generally agreed
to further restrictions on the disposition of certain holdings as set forth in
various agreements entered into in connection with the purchase of this
investment. This investment is valued at fair value as determined in accordance
with the procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. For the acquisition dates
of this investment, the enforceable right to acquire this security, along with
the cost and value at June 30, 2008, please see the Schedule of Investments.

3. ADVISER, ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

The Adviser does not charge a management fee to the Fund. Limited partners are
responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser directly under their individual
investment management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the
fees to be paid to the Adviser, which are ordinarily expressed as a percentage
of the limited partners assets managed by the Adviser. This fee, which is
negotiated between the limited partner and the Adviser, may include a
performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.

The Adviser has voluntarily agreed that certain expenses of the Fund, including
custody fees and administrative fees shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per
annum of the Fund's net asset value, and the Adviser or its affiliates will
waive Fund fees or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent necessary so that such
0.50% limit is not exceeded. The following expenses of the Fund are specifically
excluded from the expense limit: organizational expenses; extraordinary,
non-recurring and certain other unusual expenses; taxes and fees; and expenses
incurred indirectly by the Fund through its investments in Structured Credit
Investments. The Adviser may discontinue all or part of this waiver at any time.

SEI Global Services, Inc. (the "Administrator"), serves as the Fund's
administrator. The Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments
Company. The Administrator provides certain administrative, accounting, and
transfer agency services to the Fund. The services to be performed by the
Administrator may be completed by one or more of its affiliated companies. The
Fund pays the Administrator a fee equal to 0.10% (on an annualized basis) of the
Fund's Net Asset Value which is accrued monthly

based on month-end net assets and is paid monthly, and reimburses the
Administrator for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Investments Distribution Co. (the "Placement Agent") serves as the Fund's
placement agent pursuant to an agreement with the Fund. The Placement Agent is a
wholly owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company. It is not anticipated that
the Placement Agent will be compensated by the Fund for its services rendered
under the agreement.

4. ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

The Fund maintains a separate capital account for each of its limited partners.
As of the last day of each fiscal period, the Fund shall allocate net profits or
losses for that fiscal period to the capital accounts of all limited partners,
in proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such
fiscal period (after taking into account any capital contributions deemed to be
made as of the first day of such fiscal period).

5. PARTNERS' CAPITAL

The Fund, in the discretion of the Board, may sell Interests, at net asset
value, to new limited partners and may allow existing limited partners to
purchase additional Interests in the Fund on such days as are determined by the
Board in its sole discretion. It is the Fund's intention to allow limited
purchases of Interests only during designated subscriptions periods as may be
established by the Board or its designees (currently, the Adviser) and
communicated to limited partners. The Board or its designee will determine the
amount of Interests offered to limited partners during a subscription period at
its discretion. During the established subscription periods, Interests may be
purchased on a business day, or at such other times as the Board may determine,
at the offering price (which is net asset value). The Fund may discontinue its
offering at any time.

The Fund is a closed-end investment company, and therefore no limited partner
will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Interests.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase outstanding Interests
pursuant to written tenders by limited partners. Repurchase offers will be made
at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its sole
discretion. In determining whether the Fund should repurchase Interests from
limited partners pursuant to written tenders, the Board will consider the

5. PARTNERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Fund does not intend to conduct any repurchase offers until two years after the
commencement of the Fund's operation. After the initial two year period, the
Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day of March,
June, September, and December. However, limited partners will not be permitted
to tender for repurchase Interests that were acquired less than two years prior
to the effective date of the proposed repurchase.

Capital contributions received in advance are comprised of cash received prior
June 30, 2008, for which member interests of the Fund were issued on July 1,
2008. Capital contributions received in advance do not participate in the
earnings of the Fund until the related member interests are issued.

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The cost of security purchases and proceeds from the sale and maturity of
securities, other than temporary cash investments, during the period from
January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008 were $44,604,962 and $1,946,481,
respectively.

As of June 30, 2008, the aggregate cost of investments for tax purposes was
expected to be similar to book cost of $68,634,243. Net unrealized depreciation
on investments for tax purposes was $2,793,936 consisting of $3,638,332 of gross
unrealized appreciation and $6,432,268 of gross unrealized depreciation.

7. CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

In the normal course of business, the Fund trades various financial instruments
and enters into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. The
Fund's satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the
statement of assets and liabilities.

The market value of the Fund's investments will change in response to interest
rate changes and other factors. During periods of falling interest rates, the
values of fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely, during periods of
rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline. Changes
by recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in
the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also
affect the value of these investments.
