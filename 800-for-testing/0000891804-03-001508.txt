Portfolio Manager's
               COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom Spalding reviews economic and market conditions, key
investment strategies, and the recent performance of these Nuveen National
Funds. A 27-year Nuveen veteran, Tom has managed NXZ since its inception in
March 2001, and assumed responsibility for NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF in January
2003.



WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE PERIOD
ENDED APRIL 30, 2003?

The underlying economic and market conditions have not changed much since our
last shareholder report dated October 31, 2002. We believe the most influential
factors shaping the U.S. economy and the municipal market during this reporting
period continued to be the sluggish pace of economic growth and interest rates
that remained at 40-year lows. At the same time, continued geopolitical
concerns, centering on the ongoing threat of terrorism and the situation in
Iraq, also had an impact during this reporting period, particularly in terms of
investor sentiment.

In the municipal market, the slow economic recovery and the continued lack of
inflationary pressures created conditions that helped many bonds perform well
during this reporting period. As of April 2003, inflation was running at 1.5%
annualized, the lowest annual rate in 37 years. Following a record year in 2002,
municipal issuance nationwide remained very heavy during the first four months
of 2003, with $113.5 billion in new municipal bonds coming to market, an
increase of 21% over the same period in 2002. Despite the large supply of new
municipal bonds, firm or improving prices indicated continued strong demand from
investors. In particular, institutional investors such as property/ casualty
insurance companies, hedge funds, arbitrage accounts and pension funds were
active buyers in the municipal market over much of this reporting period.

For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for your
Fund in this report.

For the twelve months ended April 30, 2003, all six of the Funds in this report
outperformed the unleveraged, unmanaged Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index.
All except NMO also outperformed their Lipper Fund peer group average.


1    The total annual returns on common share net asset value (NAV) for these
     Funds are compared with the total annual return of the Lehman Brothers
     Municipal Bond Index, an unleveraged index comprising a broad range of
     investment-grade municipal bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not
     reflect any expenses.

2    The total returns of these Nuveen Funds are compared with the average
     annualized return of the 58 funds in the Lipper General Leveraged Municipal
     Debt Funds category. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of
     dividends.

3    The taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Nuveen Fund on an
     after-tax basis. The taxable-equivalent yield is based on the Fund's market
     yield on the indicated date and a federal income tax rate of 30%.


                                       2

<PAGE>

Much of this outperformance relative to the Lehman Index is attributable to the
Funds' leveraged capital structures and to their relatively long durations4.
While leverage adds volatility to a Fund, it can help enhance the amount of
income paid to common shareholders, especially during a period of low short-term
interest rates as was the case during the twelve-month period. The Funds'
performances compared with the Lehman index also was helped by their relatively
long durations. Duration is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest
rates, and, generally, the longer the duration, the more the price of an
investment will react to a change in prevailing interest rates. In a time of
generally declining interest rates, as was the case during much of the
twelve-month period, longer duration investments would be expected to outperform
shorter duration investments, all other things being equal. The durations of the
six Funds as of April 30, 2003, ranged from 9.15 to 10.09, compared with 7.84
for the Lehman index.

In addition to leverage and duration, the relative performances of these Funds
were influenced by factors such as call exposure, portfolio trading activity and
the price movement of specific sectors and holdings. During the twelve-month
period, for example, the performance of NMO was impacted by its holdings of
bonds backed by American Airlines and United Air Lines. Over the past year, the
market value of most airline-backed bonds fell, due in part to a decline in
passenger volume and in part to the well-documented financial struggles of the
industry's two largest carriers.

As of April 30, 2003, NMO held $50.1 million par value, or 4.8% of its
portfolio, in airline-backed bonds, and their depreciation over the twelve-month
period cost the Fund approximately 375 basis points in total return performance.

HOW DID THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates at historically low levels, the dividend-payment
capabilities of these Funds benefited from their use of leverage. The amount of
this benefit is tied in part to the short-term rates the Funds pay their
MuniPreferred(R) shareholders. Low short-term rates can enable the Funds to
reduce the amount of income they pay MuniPreferred holders, which potentially
can leave more earnings to support common share dividends. During the twelve
months ended April 30, 2003, the continued low level of short-term interest
rates enabled us to implement four dividend increases in NPP, NMA, and NXZ;
three in NMO and NAD; and one in NZF.

Over the course of this twelve-month period, strong demand and favorable market
conditions helped to



4    Duration is a measure of a Fund's NAV volatility in reaction to interest
     rate movements. Fund duration, also known as leverage-adjusted duration,
     takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is
     generally longer than the duration of the actual portfolio of individual
     bonds that make up the Fund. References to duration in this commentary are
     intended to indicate Fund duration unless otherwise noted.

boost the share prices of all six Funds. Since their NAVs also increased, NAD
moved from trading at a premium to its common share net asset value to trading
at a discount, while the remaining five Funds continued to trade at discounts as
of April 30, 2003 (see charts on individual Performance Overview pages).

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE PERIOD ENDED
APRIL 30, 2003?

Over the reporting period, we continued to place strong emphasis on diversifying
the Funds' port-folios, enhancing call protection and supporting their future
dividend-paying capabilities. Strategically, our main focus centered on
systematically shortening the Funds' durations, which we believe will help us
better control the Funds' interest rate risk over time and enhance their ability
to produce consistent returns. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of
a Fund's portfolio will decline when market interest rates rise (since bond
prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates). The longer the
duration of a Fund's portfolio, the greater its interest rate risk.

In line with our moderated duration strategy, we concentrated on finding value
in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve (i.e., bonds that mature in
about 20 years). In many cases, these long-intermediate bonds were offering
yields similar to those of longer bonds but, in our opinion, had less inherent
interest rate risk. Over the period, the purchase of bonds in this part of the
curve helped to shorten the durations of these Funds, making their portfolios
less sensitive to any changes in the interest rate environment while still
allowing them to provide competitive yields.

In general, the heavy issuance in the municipal market over the past year
provided us with increased opportunities to purchase the types of bond
structures that we favor. We also continued to look for individual issues that
we believed would perform well regardless of the future direction of interest
rates. Overall, we emphasized undervalued sectors of the market and geographical
areas with healthy levels of issuance, such as Texas and Florida. All six Funds
also maintained substantial weightings in healthcare bonds, the top performing
group among the Lehman revenue sectors for the twelve months ended April 30,
2003.

Each of these Funds held modest positions (less than 5% of its portfolio) in
bonds backed by the 1998 Master Tobacco Settlement Agreement. Over the past five
years, fourteen states, the


                                       4

<PAGE>

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, New York City, and individual counties
in California and New York have issued almost $20 billion of tobacco
securitization bonds backed by this agreement. In recent months, the prices of
these bonds weakened as the result of lawsuits involving the major tobacco
companies as well as the increased issuance of such bonds by states planning to
use the proceeds to help close budget gaps. Although the sector as a whole
produced negative returns over the twelve-month period, tobacco bonds showed
some recovery toward the end of the period.

Given the current geopolitical and economic climate, we believe that maintaining
strong credit quality remains a vital requirement, and we continued to emphasize
higher rated and insured bonds in our purchases for the Funds. As of April 30,
2003, each of these Funds offered excellent credit quality, with allocations of
bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed and AA ranging from 69% to 84%. In general, our
weightings in higher quality and insured bonds benefited the performance of
these Funds during the twelve-month period.

WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE MUNICIPAL MARKET IN GENERAL AND THESE NUVEEN FUNDS
IN PARTICULAR?

We think new issuance volume should remain strong, as issuers continue to take
advantage of the low rate environment. Adding to our expec tations for continued
strong issuance are the budget deficits affecting many states, and their
continued need to raise money for infrastructure, education and healthcare
needs. Over coming months, we will continue to closely monitor the states'
budgetary situations to watch for any potential impact on credit ratings.

Looking at the bond call exposure, we believe these Funds offer good levels of
call protection during the remainder of 2003 and through 2004. As of April 30,
2003, the percentage of bonds eligible for calls ranged from 1% in NZF to 14% in
NPP during 2003 and 2004. The number of actual calls during this time will
depend largely on market interest rates and the specific situations of
individual issuers.

In the coming months, our primary goal will continue to be moderating the Funds'
durations. In addition, we plan to watch for opportunities to purchase or swap
for issues that we perceive to be under-valued, particularly in sectors of the
market that have recently underperformed. The expected strong supply of new
bonds should help us in this effort.

                         payment of principal or interest or has filed for
                         bankruptcy.

                         was likely United would not remain current of their
                         interest payment obligations with respect to these
                         bonds and thus has stopped accruing interest.

                         variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a

Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation
The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers and general
market conditions. If it is determined that market prices for a security are
unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or
its designee, may establish a fair value for the security. Temporary investments
in securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term securities are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

Securities Transactions
Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2003,
Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) had outstanding when-issued and delayed delivery
purchase commitments of $7,074,657. There were no such outstanding purchase
commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income
Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.

Federal Income Taxes
Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the
Funds.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared and paid monthly.
Net realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions,
if any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares
The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the six months ended April 30, 2003.

Custodian Fee Credit
Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Offering Costs
Costs incurred by Performance Plus (NPP) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) in
connection with their offerings of Preferred shares ($501,135 and $3,495,003,
respectively) were recorded as a reduction to paid-in surplus.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

SIDEBAR TEXT: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

On November 14, 2002, the Board adopted a policy that allows these Funds, in
addition to investments in municipal bonds, to invest up to 5% of its net assets
(including assets attributable to preferred shares, if any) in tax-exempt or
taxable fixed-income securities or equity securities for the purpose of
acquiring control of an issuer whose municipal bonds (a) the Fund already owns
and (b) have deteriorated or are expected shortly to deteriorate significantly
in credit quality, provided Nuveen Advisory determines that such investment
should enable the Fund to better maximize the value of its existing investment
in such issuer. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of each Fund which means
that it can be changed at any time by the Board of Trustees without vote of the
shareholders.


GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

Average Effective Maturity: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

Net Asset Value (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ---------
Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock in
the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed advisable. No shares
were repurchased during the six-month period ended April 30, 2003. Any future
repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual or semiannual
report.
