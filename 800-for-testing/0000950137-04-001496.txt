Item 1. Report to Shareholders.

The Trust's annual report transmitted to shareholders pursuant to Rule 30e-1
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is as follows:

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this report, you'll learn about how your investment in Van Kampen High
       Income Trust II performed during the annual period. The portfolio
       management team will provide an overview of the market conditions and
       discuss some of the factors that affected investment performance during
       the reporting period. In addition, this report includes the trust's
       financial statements and a list of trust investments as of December 31,
       2003.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. The trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and,
       therefore, the value of the trust shares may be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return, net asset
value (NAV) and common share market price will fluctuate and trust shares, when
sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor. The NAV per share is determined by dividing
the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share
market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust
at a given time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an
investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for
the period in accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
of all shares at the end of the period.

The Chase High Yield Index is generally representative of high-yield securities.
The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales charges, which would
lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be considered an
investment.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Van Kampen High Income Trust II is managed by the adviser's High Yield team.(1)
Current team members include Gordon Loery, Executive Director; Josh Givelber,
Vice President; Chad Liu, Vice President; and Sheila Finnerty, Managing
Director.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The high-yield market entered the 12-month period on a strong footing and
continued to rally sharply through the end of the year. The CSFB High Yield
Index, a broad benchmark for the high-yield bond market, returned 27.94 percent
for calendar 2003, its second-best annual performance since the asset class
developed in the mid-1980s.

Many factors contributed to the high-yield market's stellar performance in 2003.
Improving perceptions regarding the economy, the credit cycle, and defaults led
to renewed investor interest in credit-sensitive issues. Several highly visible
high-yield companies produced positive earnings surprises, and the Moody's
issuer-based default rate fell by more than half over the course of the year.
Low interest rates added to the allure of high-yield bonds for yield-hungry
investors. The resulting record inflows into the asset class provided portfolio
managers with large amounts of cash that handily offset a near-record amount of
new issuance. In addition, many high-yield mutual funds, which began the year
with conservative portfolios relative to the high-yield indices, began heavily
buying lower-rated credits in an attempt to catch up to the rallying market.

These factors combined to produce significant price appreciation across all
sectors of the high yield-market, with the most speculative companies in the
lowest credit tiers tending to perform most strongly. Wireless communications,
utilities, telecom, and cable--among the worst performers in 2001 and 2002--were
the best performing sectors in 2003. More typically defensive sectors, such as
consumer products and food and drug, lagged, as did forest products and metals.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated based upon either the market price
or the net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by
dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets,
less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while
market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly. On both a market-price and a NAV basis, the
trust outperformed its benchmark, the Chase High Yield Index. (See table below.)

In keeping with our focus on bottom-up issue selection, the greatest driver of
the trust's performance was strong credit selection. Many of the portfolio's
best performers entered the year at a steep discount to their par (or face)
value, and enjoyed robust price appreciation as well as attractive income over
the course of the year. In the wireless sector, the portfolio's position in
Nextel benefited from the company's continued financial strength coupled with a
low valuation at the beginning of the period. The trust enjoyed similarly strong
performance from companies in the broadcasting, utilities, cable,
telecommunications and chemicals industries.

The trust uses leverage on an ongoing basis to enhance its dividend to common
shareholders. The trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance
of preferred shares. The proceeds are invested in longer-term securities, taking
advantage of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. With
short-term rates at historic lows during the period, the difference between
short- and longer-term rates was relatively high. This made using leverage a
particularly profitable approach during the period, and added to the trust's
strong performance.

While the trust's performance outpaced its benchmark, not all of its positions
were beneficial. The rapid rise in the market price of CCC-rated debt led us to
trim some of the trust's exposure to those securities in order to redeploy
assets into parts of the market we viewed as more attractive. While we remain
convinced of the wisdom of this approach in the long-term, it did cause the
portfolio to miss some of the price performance of these lower-rated securities.
The trust benefited from strong credit selection within utilities, though our
stringent investment criteria made it difficult to find attractive companies in

that sector given its widespread problem of overcapacity. As a result, the trust
did not fully benefit from this sector's strong performance during the year.
Going forward, we hope to see continued improvement in the economy, which should
bode well for the high-yield market, and we will continue to closely monitor the
market for compelling investment opportunities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide high current
income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital through investment in a
professionally managed diversified portfolio of high yield, fixed income
securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on April 28, 1989.
Effective November 30, 2003, the Trust's investment adviser, Van Kampen
Investment Advisory Corp. merged into its affiliate, Van Kampen Asset
Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute

substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no
provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2003, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $25,739,010 which expires between December 31,
2007 and December 31, 2011.

    At December 31, 2003, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually to common shareholders. Distributions from net
realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains which are
included in ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 was as follows:

Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................  $3,889,082    $5,224,881
  Return of capital.........................................     101,822       383,362

                                                              $3,990,904    $5,608,243
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting for the 2003 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified. Permanent differences of $132,940
relating to book to tax amortization differences were reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss, $5,860 relating to fee income received from tender offers were
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss, $101,601 relating to return of capital distributions were
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to paid in
surplus, and $2,448,303 relating to a portion of the capital loss carry forward
that expired during the tax year ended December 31, 2003, were reclassified from
accumulated net realized loss to paid in surplus.

                                                                              19

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes as a result of post-October losses of $1,506,389 which are not
recognized for tax purposes until the first day of the following year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets of the Trust.

    For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $4,400 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the year ended December
31, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $23,800 representing
Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen") cost
of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are reported as
part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments were $43,360,860 and $43,510,470, respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

As of December 31, 2003, the Trust has outstanding 1,112 Auction Preferred
Shares ("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is currently
reset every 28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on December
31, 2003 was 1.128%. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the rates ranged
from 0.95% to 1.39%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of Preferred Share Maintenance
expense.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen High Income Trust II

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2003, the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
four years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits. The Trust's financial highlights for the periods ended
prior to December 31, 2000, were audited by other auditors whose report, dated
February 4, 2000, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2003, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II as of December 31, 2003, the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. All Common Shareholders are deemed to be participants in the Plan unless
they specifically elect not to participate. Common Shareholders who elect not to
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions of dividends and capital
gains in cash paid by check mailed directly to the Common Shareholder by the
Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    All Common Shareholders of the Trust are deemed to be participants in the
Plan unless they specifically elect not to participate. You may withdraw from
the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by writing State Street Bank
and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made for any fractional
Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

                           AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different
period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and
pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent Auditors
without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.

- --------
(1)      This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
         Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), adopted as of the date above,
         supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been
         adopted from time to time.

(2)      Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have
         the meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.



<PAGE>

The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the list of general
pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.

2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit services. All
other Audit services not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated):

     -   Statutory audits or financial audits for the Fund
     -   Services associated with SEC registration statements (including new
         funds), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or
         other documents issued in connection with securities offerings (e.g.,
         comfort letters for closed-end fund offerings, consents), and
         assistance in responding to SEC comment letters
     -   Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or standard
         setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may be
         "audit related" services rather than "audit" services)

4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or

<PAGE>

regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with internal control reporting
requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following Audit-related
services. All other Audit-related services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):

     -   Attest procedures not required by statute or regulation (including
         agreed upon procedures related to the Closed-End Fund asset coverage
         tests required by the rating agencies and/or lenders)
     -   Due diligence services pertaining to potential fund mergers
     -   Issuance of SAS-70 reports on internal controls of Morgan Stanley
         Trust Co. and MSIM Trade Operations
     -   Consultations by the Fund's management as to the accounting or
         disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or
         potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or
         interpretations by the SEC, FASB, or other regulatory or
         standard-setting bodies (Note: Under SEC rules, some consultations may
         be "audit" services rather than "audit-related" services)
     -   Information systems reviews not performed in connection with the audit
         (e.g., application data center and technical reviews)
     -   General assistance with implementation of the requirements of SEC
         rules or listing standards promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
         Act
     -   Audit of record keeping services performed by Morgan Stanley Trust
         Fund related to the New Jersey State Retirement Plan


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the following Tax Services. All Tax services involving large and
complex transactions not listed below must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies):

     -   U.S. federal, state and local tax planning and advice
     -   U.S. federal, state and local tax compliance
     -   International tax planning and advice
     -   International tax compliance
     -   Review of federal, state, local and international income, franchise,
         and other tax returns
     -   Identification of Passive Foreign Investment Companies
     -   Review of closed-end funds pro rata allocation of taxable income and
         capital gains to common and preferred shares.
     -   Domestic and foreign tax planning, compliance, and advice
     -   Assistance with tax audits and appeals before the IRS and similar
         state, local and foreign agencies
     -   Tax advice and assistance regarding statutory, regulatory or
         administrative developments (e.g., excise tax reviews, evaluation of
         Fund's tax compliance function)
     -   Review the calculations of taxable income from corporate actions
         including reorganizations related to bankruptcy filings and provide
         guidance related to the foregoing


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES



<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the following All Other services.
Permissible All Other services not listed below must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated):

     -   Risk management advisory services, e.g., assessment and testing of
         security infrastructure controls

         The following is a list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services. The
SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be consulted to determine the precise
definitions of these services and the applicability of exceptions to certain of
the prohibitions:

     -   Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
         financial statements of the audit client
     -   Financial information systems design and implementation
     -   Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
         contribution-in-kind reports
     -   Actuarial services
     -   Internal audit outsourcing services
     -   Management functions
     -   Human resources
     -   Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services
     -   Legal services
     -   Expert services unrelated to the audit

7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
and management will immediately report to the chairman of the Audit Committee
any breach of this Policy that comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief
Financial Officer or any member of management.

9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS



<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:

     -   Van Kampen Investments, Inc.
     -   Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corporation
     -   Van Kampen Asset Management Inc.
     -   Van Kampen Advisors Inc.
     -   Van Kampen Funds Inc.
     -   Van Kampen Trust Company
     -   Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.
     -   Van Kampen Management Inc.
     -   Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.
     -   Morgan Stanley Investments LP
     -   Morgan Stanley Trust Company

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services are determined to have a direct impact
on the operations or financial reporting of the Registrant. 100% of such
services were pre-approved by the audit committee pursuant to the Audit
Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures (attached hereto).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

Not applicable.

Item 6.  [Reserved.]

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

I.       POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policies and
procedures for voting proxies with respect to securities held in the accounts of
clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary Investment
Management services and for which a MSIM entity has the authority to vote their
proxies. The policies and procedures and general guidelines in this section will
be reviewed and, as necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised
proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by these policies and procedures
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, L.P., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Investments LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each a "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will vote proxies as part of its authority to manage,
acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the MSIM registered
management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and Advisor
Funds)(collectively referred to as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM Fund will vote
proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the
case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management Agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or
its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a statement of proxy voting
policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's
policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations
or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their responsibility
for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process, Institutional
Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility Research Center
("IRRC") have been retained as experts in the proxy voting and corporate
governance area. ISS and IRRC are independent advisers that specialize in
providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional
investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
institutional investors. The services provided to MSIM Affiliates include
in-depth research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. In
addition to research, ISS provides vote execution, reporting, and recordkeeping.
MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A. below) will carefully monitor
and supervise the services provided by the proxy research services.
<PAGE>
Voting Proxies for certain Non-US Companies - While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States and other developed markets with a number
of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies
of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging
markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent a MSIM
Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are not
limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other
than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings;
(iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction
of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person,
(v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting
instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best
efforts basis only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been
retained to provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting
their clients' non-US proxies.

II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad range of issues, including board size and
composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover proposals, capital structure
proposals and social responsibility issues and are meant to be general voting
parameters on issues that arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however,
may vote in a manner that is contrary to the following general guidelines,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section IV. below, provided the vote is
consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

                           generally be approved if the resulting increase in

         3.       The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may
                  have a substantive financial or best interest impact on the
                  shareholder, are generally voted against (notwithstanding
                  management support), subject to the review and approval of the
                  Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate.

                  o        Capitalization changes that add classes of stock
                           which substantially dilute the voting interests of
                           existing shareholders.

                  o        Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares
                           of existing classes of stock that carry preemptive
                           rights or supervoting rights.

                  o        Creation of "blank check" preferred stock.

                  o        Changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

                  o        Compensation proposals that allow for discounted
                           stock options that have not been offered to employees
                           in general.

                  o        Amendments to bylaws that would require a
                           supermajority shareholder vote to pass or repeal
                           certain provisions.

                  o        Proposals to indemnify auditors.

         4.       The following types of non-routine proposals, which
                  potentially may have a potential financial or best interest
                  impact on an issuer, are voted as determined by the Proxy
                  Review Committee.

                  Corporate Transactions

                  o        Mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate
                           transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of
                           assets, reorganizations, restructurings and
                           recapitalizations) will be examined on a case-by-case
                           basis. In all cases, ISS and IRRC research and
                           analysis will be used along with MSIM Affiliates'
                           research and analysis, based on, among other things,
                           MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.

                  o        Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                           compensation plans, employment contracts, and
                           severance agreements that benefit management and
                           would be costly to shareholders if triggered.

                  o        Shareholders rights plans that allow appropriate
                           offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                           trigger provisions that prevent legitimate offers
                           from proceeding.

                  o        Executive/Director stock option plans. Generally,
                           stock option plans should meet the following
                           criteria:

                           (i)      Whether the stock option plan is incentive
                                    based;

                           (ii)     For mature companies, should be no more than
                                    5% of the issued capital at the time of
                                    approval;

                           (iii)    For growth companies, should be no more than
                                    10% of the issued capital at the time of
                                    approval.

                           poison pills.

                  o        Anti-takeover and related provisions that serve to
                           prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                           their rights or effectively deter the appropriate
                           tender offers and other offers.

B.       SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

         1.       The following shareholder proposals are generally supported,

                  o        Proposals that request or require disclosure of
                           executive compensation in addition to the disclosure
                           required by the Securities and Exchange Commission
                           ("SEC") regulations.

                  o        Proposals that limit retirement benefits or executive
                           compensation.

                  o        Requiring shareholder approval for bylaw or charter

                           costly to provide or that would require duplicative
                           efforts or expenditures that are of a non-business
                           nature or would provide no pertinent information from
                           the perspective of institutional shareholders.

                  o        Restrictions related to social, political or special

                           have a significant financial or best interest impact

                  o        Proposals that require inappropriate endorsements or

IV.      ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A.       PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

         1.       The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible
                  for creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                  Procedures and, in this regard, has expressly adopted them.
                  Following are some of the functions and responsibilities of
                  the Committee.

                  (a)      The Committee, which will consist of members
                           designated by MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is
                           responsible for establishing MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines and determining how MSIM will
                           vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

                  (b)      The Committee will periodically review and have the
                           authority to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy
                           Voting Policy and Procedures) and establish and
                           direct voting positions consistent with the Client
                           Proxy Standard.

                  (c)      The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among
                           other matters): (1) address any outstanding issues
                           relating to MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                           Procedures; and (2) generally review proposals at
                           upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM portfolio
                           companies in accordance with this Policy and
                           Procedures including, as appropriate, the voting
                           results of prior shareholder meetings of the same
                           issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
                           shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will
                           timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy
                           and Procedures (and any amendments to them and/or any
                           additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

                  (d)      The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among
                           other matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e.,
                           allowing certain shares of the same issuer that are
                           the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held
                           by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
                           differently than other shares) and/or "override
                           voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a
                           manner contrary to the Procedures); (2) review and
                           approve upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters
                           for which specific direction has been provided in
                           Sections I, II, and III above; and (3) determine how
                           to vote matters for which specific direction has not
                           been provided in Sections I, II and III above. Split
                           votes will generally not be approved within a single
                           Global Investor Group team. The Committee may take
                           into account ISS recommendations and the research
                           provided by IRRC as well as any other relevant
                           information they may request or receive.

                  (e)      In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                           Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                           material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                           appearance of a potential material conflict of
                           interest, the Committee will designate a special
                           committee to review, and recommend a course of action


<PAGE>
                           with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                           ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may
                           request the assistance of the Law and Compliance
                           Departments and will have sole discretion to cast a
                           vote. In addition to the research provided by ISS and
                           IRRC, the Special Committee may request analysis from
                           MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and outside
                           sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

                  (f)      The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will document in writing all of their
                           decisions and actions, which documentation will be
                           maintained by the Committee and the Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s) for a period of at
                           least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate
                           to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                           investment company, the Committee and Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
                           decisions to each applicable Board of
                           Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at
                           each Board's next regularly Scheduled Board meeting.
                           The report will contain information concerning
                           decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee
                           during the most recently ended calendar quarter
                           immediately preceding the Board meeting.

The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s), will timely
communicate to applicable PMs, the Compliance Departments and, as necessary to
ISS, decisions of the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other
things, ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                              ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as


<PAGE>
officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment
                  of the Fund;

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         o        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;


<PAGE>
         o        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         o        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         o        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(1) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         o        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         o        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         o        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a


- --------
(1) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."


<PAGE>
                  recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         o        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         o        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or
C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen High Income Trust
     II;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
     controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
     that material information relating to the registrant, including its
