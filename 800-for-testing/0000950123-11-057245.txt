            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1), LLC:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital and the related statements of operations, of changes in members'
capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Grosvenor Registered
Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1),LLC (the "Fund") at March 31, 2011, the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and the changes in its
members' capital and the financial highlights for the year then ended and for
the period January 1, 2010 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2010,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statements
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     the formation of the TI 1 Fund, refer to the financial highlights of
     Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC in the attached
     audited financial statements.

(a)  Average Members' Capital is determined by using the net assets at the
     beginning of each month during the period.

(b)  The ratio reflects the income and expenses including the TI 1 Fund's
     proportionate share of income and expenses of Grosvenor Registered

(c)  The ratio reflects the expenses including the TI 1 Fund's proportionate
     share of the expenses of Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund,

(d)  The total return is not annualized. Total return assumes a purchase of an
     Interest in the TI 1 Fund on the first day and the sale of an Interest on
     the last day of the period and is calculated by using geometrically linked
     monthly returns. An individual Member's return may vary from these returns
     based on the timing of Member subscriptions and repurchases and management
     fee terms (see Note 4 "Management Fee").

1. ORGANIZATION

     Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1), LLC (the "TI 1 Fund") is a
     Delaware limited liability company registered under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end management
     investment company and is operating as a diversified investment company.
     The TI 1 Fund was formed as of October 26, 2009 and commenced operations on
     January 1, 2010. The TI 1 Fund has many of the features of a private
     investment fund. The TI 1 Fund's interests ("Interests") are offered only
     in private placements to persons (i) who are both "accredited investors"
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and "qualified clients" under
     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and
     (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the TI 1
     Fund. The primary investment objectives of the TI 1 Fund are to provide
     investors (i) an attractive, long-term rate of return, on an absolute as
     well as a risk-adjusted basis, (ii) low performance volatility and (iii)
     minimal correlation with the equity and fixed income markets. The TI 1 Fund
     seeks to achieve these objectives by investing substantially all of its
     assets in Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the
     "Company"), also a Delaware limited liability company registered under the
     1940 Act as a closed-end, diversified management investment company. The
     Company employs a multi-strategy, multi-manager investment strategy as
     detailed in its financial statements, which are attached herein. There can
     be no assurance that the investment objectives of the TI 1 Fund or the
     Company will be achieved. The investment managers of the private investment
     funds in which the Company invests generally conduct their investment
     programs through these private investment funds (collectively, the
     "Portfolio Funds"). The Company invests in the Portfolio Funds as a limited
     partner, member or shareholder, along with other investors.

     The financial statements of the Company, including the Schedule of
     Investments, are attached to this report and should be read in conjunction
     with the TI 1 Fund's financial statements. As of March 31, 2011, the TI 1
     Fund's beneficial ownership of the Company's Members' Capital was 91.49%.

     The TI 1 Fund was formed as part of a reorganization of the Company into a
     "master/feeder" investment structure (the "Reorganization"). As part of the
     Reorganization, members of the Company became members ("Members") of the TI
     1 Fund. The TI 1 Fund had no assets, liabilities, or operations prior to
     the Reorganization.

     Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC ("BACA") served as the investment
     adviser (the "Adviser") of the Company and the management services provider
     of the TI 1 Fund. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under
     the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
     Bank of America Corporation ("BAC"). BAC is a financial holding company,
     which has its principal executive offices at 101 North Tryon Street,
     Charlotte, North Carolina. The Adviser provided various management and
     administrative services to the Company and the TI 1 Fund.

                                 March 31, 2011

     The Adviser retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the
     "Subadviser") as the subadviser to the Company, which is also registered as
     an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Subadviser is responsible
     for implementing the Company's investment strategy and managing the
     Company's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in accordance with
     the investment objective, philosophy and strategy described in the
     Company's registration statement and is subject to oversight by the Adviser
     and the Board of Directors of the Company, whose members also comprise the
     TI 1 Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board").

     The Board has overall responsibility to manage and supervise the operations
     of the TI 1 Fund, including the exclusive authority to oversee and to
     establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the
     TI 1 Fund's business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and
     responsibilities on behalf of the TI 1 Fund as customarily exercised by
     directors of a typical investment company registered under the 1940 Act and
     organized as a corporation. The Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the
     day-to-day operations of the TI 1 Fund.

     Subscriptions for Interests in the TI 1 Fund by eligible investors may be
     accepted as of the first day of each month, or at such times as the Board
     may determine. Investors who purchase limited liability company Interests
     in the TI 1 Fund in the offering, and other persons who acquire Interests
     and are admitted to the TI 1 Fund by its Board, will become members of the
     TI 1 Fund (the "Members"). The TI 1 Fund may, from time to time, offer to
     repurchase Interests from its Members pursuant to written tenders by
     Members. These repurchase offers will be made at such times and on such
     terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, subject to
     the liquidity of the TI 1 Fund's assets and other factors considered by the
     Board. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the TI
     1 Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Members four times each year,
     effective as of the last day of each calendar quarter. Members can only
     transfer or assign Interests under certain limited circumstances. Member
     repurchases are recognized as liabilities when the amount becomes fixed.
     This generally will occur on the last day of a fiscal period.

     As of the last day of each calendar month, the TI 1 Fund allocates net
     profits or losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Members, in
     proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such
     period (after taking into account any Member subscriptions deemed to be
     made as of the first day of such period).

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
     believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the TI 1 Fund's financial

                                 March 31, 2011


     statements are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could
     differ from these estimates.

B. EXPENSES

     The TI 1 Fund bears its own expenses and, indirectly, bears a pro rata
     portion of the Company's expenses incurred in its business, including, but
     not limited to, the following: fees paid directly or indirectly to the
     investment managers and the general operating expenses of the Portfolio
     Funds; all costs and expenses directly related to the portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Company's account; legal fees;
     accounting and auditing fees; custodial and escrow fees; fees paid to the
     TI 1 Fund's and the Company's administrator; costs of insurance; management
     fees and advisory fees; the fees and travel expenses and other expenses of
     the TI 1 Fund's and the Company's Boards; all costs with respect to
     communications regarding the TI 1 Fund's and the Company's transactions
     between the Adviser and any custodian or other agent engaged by the TI 1
     Fund; and other types of expenses approved by the TI 1 Fund's or the
     Company's Board of Directors. The expenses of the Portfolio Funds are not
     included in expenses in the TI 1 Fund's Statement of Operations or the
     Financial Highlights, as the effect of these expenses is recognized in
     realized and unrealized gains and losses allocated from the Company.

     The Adviser, the Subadviser and the TI 1 Fund have entered into an expense
     limitation and reimbursement agreement (the "Expense Limitation Agreement"
     or "ELA") under which the Adviser and Subadviser (the "Adviser Entities")
     will, subject to possible reimbursement by the TI 1 Fund as described
     below, waive fees or pay or absorb operating expenses of the TI 1 Fund
     (including the TI 1 Fund's share of the ordinary operating expenses of the
     Company) to the extent necessary to limit the ordinary operating expenses
     of the TI 1 Fund (including the TI 1 Fund's share of the ordinary operating
     expenses of the Company, but excluding (i) all fees, expenses and incentive
     allocations of the Portfolio Funds in which the Company invests; (ii) the
     Management Fee of the TI 1 Fund and the TI 1 Fund's pro rata share of the
     Advisory Fee payable to the Adviser by the Company; and (iii) taxes,
     interest and related costs of borrowing, brokerage commissions and any
     extraordinary expenses of the TI 1 Fund or the Company) to 0.28% per annum
     of the greater of the TI 1 Fund's average monthly net assets or the net
     assets at December 31, 2009 (the "Expense Limitation"). In consideration of
     the Adviser Entities' agreement to limit the TI 1 Fund's expenses, the TI 1
     Fund will carry forward the amount of fees waived and expenses paid or
     absorbed by the Adviser Entities in excess of the Expense Limitation, for a
     period not to exceed three years from the end of the fiscal year in which
     the fee was waived or the expense was paid or absorbed, and will reimburse
     the Adviser Entities such amounts. Reimbursement will be made as promptly
     as possible, but only to the extent it does not cause the TI 1 Fund's
     annualized ordinary operating expenses to exceed the Expense Limitation in
     effect at the time that the reimbursement is made. The Expense Limitation
     Agreement will remain in effect until March 31, 2012, and will
     automatically continue in effect from year to year thereafter unless
     terminated by the Adviser, Subadviser or the TI 1 Fund.

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     At March 31, 2010, the cumulative expenses over the Expense Limitation that
     had not yet been paid by the Adviser Entities equaled $179,917, which was
     recorded as a receivable on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
     Members' Capital. For the year ended March 31, 2011, the TI 1 Fund incurred
     $6,906,965 of total expenses (including $5,828,012 of expenses allocated
     from the Company), $1,364,502 of which was subject to the Expense
     Limitation Agreement. The TI 1 Fund was responsible for bearing $1,363,640
     of the total expenses based upon the provisions of the ELA, resulting in
     $862 of expenses over the Expense Limitation. The Adviser Entities paid the
     TI 1 Fund a net amount equal to $161,283 during the year, resulting in an
     amount due from the Adviser Entities equal to $19,496 at March 31, 2011,
     which has been recorded as a receivable in the Statement of Assets,
     Liabilities and Members' Capital. Cumulative expenses over the Expense
     Limitation that have been paid by the Adviser Entities to the TI 1 Fund,
     but that have not yet been reimbursed (and have not yet expired under the
     provisions of the ELA) amounted to $180,779 at March 31, 2011. The T1 1
     Fund will continue to carry forward the reimbursable expenses until they
     are reimbursed to the Adviser Entities or expire. Of the cumulative
     reimbursable expense amount in effect at March 31, 2011, $179,917 will
     expire March 31, 2013 and $862 will expire March 31, 2014. Reimbursement of
     expenses carried forward is dependent on future levels of Members' Capital
     and expenses of the TI 1 Fund and the Company.

C. INCOME TAXES

     As a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership, no
     provision for the payment of federal, state or local income taxes has been
     provided by the TI 1 Fund. Each Member is individually required to report
     on its own tax return its share of the TI 1 Fund's taxable income or loss.
     The TI 1 Fund has a tax year end of December 31.

     Net investment income or loss and net realized and unrealized gain or loss
     from investments of the TI 1 Fund for each fiscal period are allocated
     among, and credited to or debited against, the capital accounts of all
     Members as of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each
     Member's respective investment percentage for the fiscal period, as defined
     in the TI 1 Fund's Operating Agreement.

     The cost of the TI 1 Fund's investment in the Company for federal income
     tax purposes is based on amounts reported to the TI 1 Fund by the Company
     on a Schedule K-1. As of March 31, 2011, the Company has not yet received
     information to determine the current tax cost of the Portfolio Funds. Based
     on the amounts reported to the TI 1 Fund by the Company on Schedule K-1 as
     of December 31, 2010, and after adjustment for purchases and redemptions
     between December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, the TI 1 Fund's proportionate
     share of the estimated cost of the Company's investments at March 31, 2011
     for federal tax purposes is $440,316,379. The resulting estimated net
     unrealized appreciation for tax purposes on the investments at March 31,
     2011 is $27,923,114.

     The authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty
     in tax positions requires management to determine whether a tax position of
     the TI 1 Fund is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination,
     including resolution of any related appeals or litigation

                                       10

                                 March 31, 2011

     processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions
     meeting the "more likely than not" threshold, the tax amount recognized in
     the financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a
     greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
     settlement with the relevant taxing authority. The TI 1 Fund has determined
     that there are no unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities relating to
     uncertain income tax positions expected to be taken on the tax return for
     the year ended December 31, 2010. The TI 1 Fund recognizes interest and
     penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax
     expense in the Statement of Operations. During the year ended March 31,
     2011, the TI 1 Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

D. OTHER

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts maintained in a PFPC Trust
     Company interest-bearing account. Interest income is recorded on the
     accrual basis. In circumstances when insured limits are exceeded, the risk
     of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to each of
     these transactions. The TI 1 Fund has not experienced and does not expect
     to experience any losses in such accounts.

     The TI 1 Fund records its proportionate share of the Company's investment
     income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses as allocated
     by the Company. In addition, the TI 1 Fund records its own income and
     expenses on the accrual basis.

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The TI 1 Fund records its investment in the Company at fair value, which
     represents the TI 1 Fund's proportionate interest in the Company's Members'
     Capital. The performance of the TI 1 Fund is directly affected by the
     performance of the Company. The valuation of investments held by the
     Company is discussed in the notes to the Company's financial statements
     attached to this report.

4. MANAGEMENT FEE

     Pursuant to a management agreement between the TI 1 Fund and the Adviser,
     the Adviser is entitled to a management fee (the "Management Fee"), paid
     monthly in arrears, equal to an annual rate of 0.50% of the Members' ending
     monthly capital of the TI 1 Fund before taking into consideration the
     Management Fee, prior to any repurchases or distribution of capital during
     the month. However, with respect to the capital accounts of any Members who
     became Members in connection with the Reorganization of the Company and
     who, at the time of the Reorganization, had positive loss carryforwards in
     the Company (a "Loss Carryforward Amount"), the Management Fee payable by
     the TI 1 Fund with respect to the capital account of such a Member shall,
     until such time as the Member's Loss Carryforward Amount is first reduced
     to zero, be reduced so that the aggregate of the portion of the Management
     Fee attributable to such capital account plus the capital account's pro
     rata share of the advisory fee of the Company borne by the TI 1 Fund as an
     investor in the Company does not exceed the management fee of the Company
     that the Member would have borne as

                                       11

                                 March 31, 2011


     an investor in the Company prior to the Reorganization. The portion of the
     Management Fee attributable to a Member's capital account is specially
     allocated to such Member.

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

     Affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending,
     brokerage, or other business relationships with the Portfolio Funds in
     which the Company invests and with the companies in which the Portfolio
     Funds invest.

     Effective November 19, 2009, the Board was made up of five Board members
     who are not "interested persons", as defined by the 1940 Act, of the TI 1
     Fund (the "Disinterested Directors"). Until July 1, 2010, each
     Disinterested Director received per-meeting fees of: $500 for attendance at
     quarterly meetings of the Board; and $500 for telephonic participation at a
     quarterly Board meeting or for participation at a telephonic special
     meeting of the Board. Effective July 1, 2010, compensation to the Board is
     paid and expensed by the Company. All Disinterested Directors may be
     reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses of attendance at each regular or
     special meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof and for their
     expenses, if any, in connection with any other service or activity they
     perform or engage in as Disinterested Directors.

     PFPC Trust Company, which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing
     Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the TI 1
     Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the TI 1 Fund. On July 1,
     2010, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. sold the outstanding stock of
     PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. to The Bank of New York Mellon
     Corporation. At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing
     (U.S.) Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc.
     BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. serves as administrator and
     accounting agent to the TI 1 Fund and in that capacity provides certain
     accounting, record keeping, investor related services, and regulatory
     administrative services. The TI 1 Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
     and the administrator based primarily upon month-end Members' Capital.

     Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated serves as the placement
     agent of the TI 1 Fund (the "Placement Agent"). Investors are charged a
     placement fee (the "Placement Fee") on Interests placed by the Placement
     Agent of 1.25% of the investment amount. The Placement Fee is paid by
     investors directly to the Placement Agent and is not borne by the Fund. The
     Placement Fee is waived for certain investors.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
   RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

     In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These may include, but
     are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
     contracts for differences and equity swaps.However, as a result of the
     investments by the Company as a limited partner, member or shareholder, the
     Company's liability with

                                       12

<PAGE>

              Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1), LLC
                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     respect to its investments in the Portfolio Funds is generally limited to
     the net asset value of its interest in each Portfolio Fund.

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in
     meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Among other
     things liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or
     unsecured sources of financing, an inability to sell assets or to withdraw
     capital from the Portfolio Funds, or unforeseen outflows of cash. This
     situation may arise due to circumstances outside of the Company's control,
     such as a general market disruption or an operational problem affecting the
     Company or third parties, including the Portfolio Funds. Also, the ability
     to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to
     sell similar assets at the same time.

     The Company's capital investment in the Portfolio Funds can be withdrawn on
     a limited basis. This may limit the ability of the Company to provide
     liquidity to the TI 1 Fund, and the TI 1 Fund may not be able to liquidate
     quickly some of its investment in the Company in order to meet liquidity
     requirements.

7. GUARANTEES

     Under the TI 1 Fund's organizational documents, its Directors and officers
     are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance
     of their duties to the TI 1 Fund. In addition, in the normal course of
     business, the TI 1 Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
     representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities. The
     TI 1 Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this
     would involve future claims against the TI 1 Fund that have not yet
     occurred. However, based on experience, the TI 1 Fund expects the risk of
     loss due to these warranties and indemnities to be remote.

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     The TI 1 Fund has evaluated all subsequent events through the date that the
     audited financial statements were available to be issued and noted the
     following:

     Effective April 1, 2011, Grosvenor became the TI 1 Fund's Adviser. Refer to
     the Subsequent Events footnote within the Company's audited financial
     statements for additional information regarding the change in Adviser and
     Board responsibilities.

     On March 30, 2011, the TI 1 Fund announced a tender offer to purchase up to
     $48,000,000 of outstanding Interests from Members. The net asset value of
     Interests will be calculated for this purpose on June 30, 2011. The tender
     offer expired on April 26, 2011.

     Subsequent to March 31, 2011, the TI 1 Fund received subscriptions from
     Members for Interests in the amount of $1,425,000 which became effective as
     of May 1, 2011.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the "Company") at March
31, 2011, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then
ended, the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments at March 31, 2011 by correspondence with the
custodian and underlying portfolio funds, provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

created with the intention of liquidating assets in a reasonable manner.  The

----------
*    The Company reorganized into a "master/feeder" structure during this
     period.

(a)  Average Members' Capital is determined using the net assets at the
     beginning of each month during the period.

(b)  Ratio does not reflect the Company's proportionate share of the net income
     (loss) and expenses, including incentive fees or allocations, of the
     Portfolio Funds. The Portfolio Funds' expense ratios, excluding incentive
     fees or allocations, range from 0.51% to 11.22% (unaudited). The Portfolio
     Funds' incentive fees or allocations can be up to 20% of profits earned
     (unaudited).

(c)  Calculated based on the amount reallocable to the Special Members for the
     period indicated, had the measurement period for incentive allocation
     closed on the dates indicated (not annualized). Calculation period for 2010
     period displayed began April 1, 2009 and ended December 31, 2009.

(d)  As of January 1, 2010, the Incentive Allocation was eliminated (see Note
     6).

(e)  Total return assumes a purchase of an interest in the Company on the first
     day and a sale of an interest on the last day of the period and is
     calculated using geometrically linked monthly returns. An individual
     Member's return may vary from these returns based on the timing of Member
     subscriptions and redemptions.

(f)  The ratio excludes in-kind transactions.

     partnerships and other private investment vehicles (the "Portfolio Funds")
     that (i) pursue non-traditional investment strategies and (ii) are expected
     to exhibit a low degree of performance correlation, not only with broad
     market indices but also with each other. These Portfolio Funds are managed
     by selected investment managers ("Investment Managers") who specialize in
     the chosen strategies. There can be no assurance that the investment
     objective of the Company will be achieved.

     On January 1, 2010, pursuant to member approval, the Company was
     reorganized into a "master/feeder" investment structure (the
     "Reorganization"). Effective as of the close of business on that date, the
     Company became a master fund, and members of the Company contributed their
     interests to a new entity, Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1),
     LLC (the "TI 1 Fund"), in exchange for interests in the TI 1 Fund. The TI 1
     Fund in turn invested substantially all of its assets into the Company. The
     TI 1 Fund had no assets, liabilities, or operations prior to the
     Reorganization.

     The TI 1 Fund and Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 2), LLC (the
     "TI 2 Fund") are each a Delaware limited liability company that is
     registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end, diversified, management
     investment company. The TI 1 Fund, the TI 2 Fund and Grosvenor
     Multi-Strategy Offshore Fund, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the
     "Offshore Fund" and together with the TI 1 Fund and TI 2 Fund, the "Feeder
     Funds" and the Company's "Members"), pursue their investment objectives by
     investing substantially all of their assets in the Company. The Feeder
     Funds have the same investment objectives and substantially the same
     investment policies as the Company (except that the Feeder Funds pursue
     their investment objectives by investing in the Company).

     Effective April 1, 2010, Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC ("BACA")
     served as the investment adviser (the "Adviser") of the Company. The
     Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
     Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). The Adviser is an
     indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BAC").
     BAC is a financial holding company which has its principal executive
     offices at 101 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina. The Adviser
     provided various management and administrative services to the Company.

                                 March 31, 2011

     The Adviser has retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor" or
     the "Subadviser") as the subadviser to the Company, which is also
     registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Subadviser
     is responsible for implementing the Company's investment strategy and
     managing the Company's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in
     accordance with the investment objective, philosophy and strategy described
     in the Company's registration statement and is subject to oversight by the
     Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company.

     The Board has overall responsibility to manage and supervise the operations
     of the Company, including the exclusive authority to oversee and to
     establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the
     Company's business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and
     responsibilities on behalf of the Company as customarily exercised by
     directors of a typical investment company registered under the 1940 Act
     organized as a corporation. The Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the
     day-to-day operations of the Company.

     As of March 31, 2011, the TI 1 Fund's ownership of the Company's Members'
     Capital was 91.49%, the TI 2 Fund's ownership of the Company's Members'
     Capital was 1.84%, and the Offshore Fund's ownership of the Company's
     Members' Capital was 6.67%.

     Interests in the Company ("Interests") are generally offered only to the
     Feeder Funds, and subscriptions for Interests may be accepted as of the
     first day of each month or at such times as the Board may determine. The
     Company may, from time to time, offer to repurchase Interests from its
     Members pursuant to written tenders by Members. These repurchase offers
     will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
     Board, in its sole discretion, subject to the liquidity of the Company's
     assets and other factors considered by the Board. The Adviser expects that
     it will recommend to the Board that the Company offer to repurchase
     Interests from Members four times each year, effective as of the last day
     of each calendar quarter. Members can only transfer or assign Interests
     under certain limited circumstances.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
     believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial
     statements are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could
     differ from these estimates.

B. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Acounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 ("ASU 2010-06" or "ASU"), Fair Value
     Measurements and Disclosures - Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
     Measurements. ASU 2010-06 is intended to improve disclosures about fair
     value measurements and thereby improve transparency of financial reporting.

                                       12

                    Notes to Financial Statements(continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are
     effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December
     15, 2009, except for certain disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances
     and settlements in the roll-forward of activity in Level 3 fair value
     measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
     15, 2010. The Company has implemented the new requirement to disclose gross
     significant transfers in and/or out of Level 2 and Level 3 and the reasons
     for those transfers in the March 31, 2011 financial statements.

     Management amended the Company's policy with respect to classification
     within the fair value hierarchy of investments in other investment funds.
     This policy amendment resulted in reclassification of certain investments
     from Level 3 to Level 2.

C. COMPANY EXPENSES

     The Company bears certain expenses incurred in its business, including, but
     not limited to, the following: fees paid directly or indirectly to the
     investment managers and general operating expenses of the Portfolio Funds;
     all costs and expenses directly related to portfolio transactions and
     positions for the Company's account; legal fees; accounting and auditing
     fees; custodial fees; fees paid to the Company's administrator; costs of
     insurance; advisory fees; subadvisory out-of-pocket fees; the fees and
     travel expenses and other expenses of the Board; all costs with respect to
     communications regarding the Company's transactions between the Adviser and
     any custodian or other agent engaged by the Company; and other types of
     expenses approved by the Board. Expenses, including incentive fees or
     allocations, of the underlying Portfolio Funds are not included in expenses
     reported on the Statement of Operations as the effect of these expenses is
     recognized in realized and unrealized gains and losses.

D. INCOME TAXES

     As a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership, no
     provision for the payment of federal, state or local income taxes has been
     provided by the Company. Each Member is individually required to report on
     its own tax return its share of the Company's taxable income or loss. The
     Company has a tax year end of December 31.

     The cost of the Company's investments in the Portfolio Funds for federal
     income tax purposes is based on amounts reported to the Company by the
     Portfolio Funds on a Schedule K-1. As of March 31, 2011, the Company has
     not yet received information to determine the current tax cost of the
     Portfolio Funds as of March 31, 2011. Based on the amounts reported to the
     Company on Schedule K-1 as of December 31, 2010, and after adjustment for
     purchases and sales between December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, the
     estimated cost of the Portfolio Funds at March 31, 2011 for federal tax
     purposes is $452,075,310. The resulting estimated net unrealized
     appreciation for tax purposes on the Portfolio Funds at March 31, 2011 is
     $28,668,820.

     The authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty
     in tax positions requires management to determine whether a tax position of
     the Company is "more likely than not" to be sustained upon examination,
     including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
     on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more
     likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial
     statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a

                                       13

<PAGE>

              Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC
                    Notes to Financial Statements(continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
     settlement with the relevant taxing authority. The Company has determined
     that there are no unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities relating to
     uncertain income tax positions taken on prior years' returns or expected to
     be taken on the tax return for the year ended December 31, 2010. The
     Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
     tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During
     the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company did not incur any interest or
     penalties.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

     Purchases of investments in the Portfolio Funds are recorded as of the
     first day of legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and withdrawals from the
     Portfolio Funds are recorded as of the last day of legal ownership.
     Realized gains or losses on investments in the Portfolio Funds are recorded
     at the time of the disposition of the respective investment on an average
     cost basis.

F. OTHER

     Net investment income or loss and net realized and unrealized gain or loss
     from investments of the Company for each fiscal period are allocated
     between, and credited to or debited against, the capital accounts of
     Members as of the last day of the fiscal period in accordance with each
     Member's respective investment percentage for the fiscal period, as defined
     in the Company's Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Operating
     Agreement").

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts maintained in a PFPC Trust
     Company interest-bearing account and include overnight deposits in
     BlackRock Liquidity Funds - Temp Fund, an affiliate of BAC. Interest income
     is recorded on the accrual basis. In circumstances when insured limits are
     exceeded, the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the
     counterparties to each of these transactions. The Fund has not experienced
     and does not expect to experience any losses in such accounts.

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The net asset value (the "NAV") of the Company is determined by, or at the
     direction of, the Adviser as of the close of business at the end of each
     fiscal period (as defined in the Company's Operating Agreement), in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below, or as may be
     determined from time to time, pursuant to valuation procedures established
     by the Board. Pursuant to the valuation procedures, the Board has delegated
     to the Adviser the general responsibility for valuation of the investments
     in the Portfolio Funds subject to the oversight by the Board.

     The investments in the Portfolio Funds are recorded at fair value,
     generally at an amount equal to the NAV of the Company's investment in the
     Portfolio Funds as determined by the Portfolio Fund's general partner or
     investment manager. If no such information is available or if such
     information is deemed to be not reflective of fair value, an estimated fair
     value is determined in good faith by the Adviser pursuant to the Company's
     valuation procedures. Generally, the NAVs of investments in the Portfolio
     Funds are determined whereby the Company records the investment and
     subsequent subscriptions at its acquisition

                                       14

<PAGE>

              Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC
                    Notes to Financial Statements(continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     cost which represents its fair value. The investment is adjusted to reflect
     the Company's share of net investment income or loss and unrealized and
     realized gain or loss that reflects the changes in the fair value of the
     investment for the period.

     The Portfolio Funds record their investments at fair value in accordance
     with GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. The Portfolio
     Funds generally hold positions in readily marketable securities and
     derivatives that are valued at quoted market values and/or less liquid
     non-marketable securities and derivatives that are valued at estimated fair
     value. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts
     that might be realized from the sale or other dispositions of investments,
     nor do they reflect other expenses or fees that might be incurred upon
     disposition. The mix and concentration of more readily marketable
     securities and less liquid non-marketable securities varies across the
     Portfolio Funds based on various factors, including the nature of their
     investment strategy and market forces.

     Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations of the investments in the
     Portfolio Funds, their estimated values may differ significantly from the
     values that would have been used had a ready market for the Portfolio Funds
     existed, and the differences could be material. Net change in accumulated
     unrealized appreciation on investments in the Statement of Operations is
     net of fees and performance-based compensation payable to the investment
     managers of the Portfolio Funds.

     Some of the Portfolio Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in
     illiquid securities and may hold a portion or all of these investments
     independently from the main portfolio. These separate baskets of illiquid
     securities ("side pockets") may be subject to additional restrictions of
     liquidity that are stricter than the liquidity restrictions applicable to
     general interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Company withdraws its
     interest from such a Portfolio Fund, it may be required to maintain its
     holding in the side pocket investments for an extended period of time and
     retain this remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund. In instances, where
     such a Portfolio Fund closes its operations, the Company may receive an
     "in-kind" distribution of a side pocket's holdings in liquidation of its
     entire interest in the Portfolio Fund. The value of side pockets may
     fluctuate significantly. As of March 31, 2011, the Company's investments in
     side pockets and special liquidating vehicles represented 2.82% of the
     Company's net assets. Additionally, the governing documents of the
     Portfolio Funds generally provide that the Portfolio Funds may suspend,
     limit or delay the right of their investors, such as the Company, to
     withdraw capital. The primary restrictions applicable to individual
     Portfolio Funds as of March 31, 2011 are described in detail on the
     Company's Schedule of Investments.

     The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
     valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair
     value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell
     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
     market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Accordingly,
     the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
     prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
     measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
     measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

                                       15

<PAGE>

              Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC
                    Notes to Financial Statements(continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     -    Level 1-Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical,
          unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
          access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2-Quoted prices which are not considered to be active, or inputs
          that are observable (either directly or indirectly) for substantially
          the full term of the asset or liability; and

     -    Level 3-Prices, inputs or modeling techniques which are both
          significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
          by little or no market activity).

     The preparation of the Schedule of Investments in conformity with GAAP
     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     amounts reported in the Schedule of Investments and accompanying notes.
     Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's
     Schedule of Investments are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual
     results could differ from these estimates. The Company relies upon the
     authoritative guidance under GAAP for estimating the fair value of
     investments in the Portfolio Funds that have calculated their NAVs in
     accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment
     companies. Accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of an
     investment in a Portfolio Fund using the NAV of the investment (or its
     equivalent) without further adjustment unless the Adviser determines that
     the NAV is deemed to be not reflective of the fair value.

     Investments may be classified as Level 2 when market information
     (observable NAVs) is available, yet the investment is not traded in an
     active market and/or the investment is subject to transfer restrictions, or
     the valuation is adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or
     non-transferability. Market information, including observable NAVs,
     subscription and redemption activity at the underlying Portfolio Fund, and
     the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is
     considered when determining the proper categorization of the investment's
     fair value measurement within the fair valuation hierarchy. Portfolio Fund
     investment lots that have observable market inputs (published NAVs) and
     that the Company has the ability to redeem from within twelve months of the
     balance sheet date are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 2.

     The Company's investments in the Portfolio Funds that have unobservable
     inputs and/or from which the Company does not have the ability to redeem
     within twelve months are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 3.
     When observable prices are not available for these securities, the Company
     uses the market approach, as defined in the authoritative guidance on fair
     value measurements, to evaluate the fair value of such Level 3 instruments.
     Although the Company does not have the ability to redeem from the Portfolio
     Funds classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy within twelve
     months of the measurement date, these Portfolio Funds may transact with
     other investors at the net asset value of the investment (or its
     equivalent). In certain circumstances, the Adviser may make adjustments to
     the reported NAV of a Portfolio Fund when it believes that the reported NAV
     is not representative of fair value. Specifically, for certain Portfolio
     Funds in liquidation, the reported NAV is adjusted based on the Adviser's
     estimate of the net realizable value of the Portfolio Fund in liquidation.
     As of March 31, 2011, approximately 8.6% of investments in Portfolio Funds
     classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy were fair valued using
     such approach.

     The level classifications in the table above may not be indicative of the
     risk associated with the investment in each Portfolio Fund.

     The Company recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated on
     the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the
     transfer. All transfers into and out of Level 2 and Level 3 can be found in
     the Level 3 reconciliation table shown below. There were no transfers
     between Level 1 and Level 2 for the year ended March 31, 2011.

     The following table includes a roll-forward of the amounts for the year
     ended March 31, 2011 for the investments classified within Level 3. The
     classification of an investment within Level 3 is based on the significance
     of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

     a fair value of $596,849, which have been re-classified as Level 3
     effective April 1, 2010. Such transfers were primarily the result of
     changes in redemption terms and the Company's inability to redeem from
     these investments within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

     The Company follows authoritative guidance that permits a reporting entity
     to measure the fair value of an investment that does not have a readily
     determinable fair value, based on the NAV for the investment. In using the
     NAV, certain attributes of the investment that may impact the fair value of
     the investment are not considered in measuring fair value. Attributes of
     those investments include the investment strategies of the investees and
     may also include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the investor's
     ability to redeem its investments at the measurement date and any unfunded
     commitments. The Company is permitted to invest in alternative investments
     that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and as such, has
     determined that the NAV, as calculated by the reporting entity, generally
     represents the fair value of the investments. A listing of the investments
     held by the Company and their attributes as of March 31, 2011, that may
     qualify for these valuations are shown in the table below.

----------
*    The information summarized in the table above represents the general
     terms of the specific asset class. Individual Portfolio Funds may have
     terms that are more or less restrictive than those terms indicated for
     the asset class as a whole. In addition, most Portfolio Funds have the
     flexibility, as provided for in constituent documents, to modify and
     waive such terms.

**   Reflects fair value of investments in each respective investment
     category.

The Company's investments reflect their estimated fair value, which for
marketable securities would generally be the last sales price on the
primary exchange for such security, and for the Portfolio Funds, would
generally be the NAV as provided by the Portfolio Fund or its
administrator. For each of the classes below, the fair value of the
Portfolio Funds has been estimated based upon the NAV of the Portfolio
Funds, subject to adjustments by the Adviser if deemed necessary.

(A) DISTRESSED SECURITIES This class includes the Portfolio Funds that
invest in debt and equity securities of companies in financial difficulty,
reorganization or bankruptcy, nonperforming and subperforming bank loans,
and emerging market debt. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had no unfunded
capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy.

(B) EVENT DRIVEN This class includes the Portfolio Funds that take
significant positions in companies with special situations, including
distressed stocks, mergers and takeovers. As of March 31, 2011, the Company
had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this
strategy.

                                 March 31, 2011

     (C) LONG AND/OR SHORT EQUITIES This class includes the Portfolio Funds that
     make long and short investments in equity securities that are deemed by the
     Investment Managers to be under or overvalued. The Investment Managers
     typically do not attempt to neutralize the amount of long and short
     positions. As of March 31, 2011, the Company had no unfunded capital
     commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy.

     (D) MULTI-ARBITRAGE This class includes the Portfolio Funds that seek to
     exploit price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on
     different markets or in different forms by simultaneously purchasing and
     selling an asset in order to profit from the difference. As of March 31,
     2011, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio
     Funds within this strategy.

     As of March 31, 2011, the Company had investments in 50 Portfolio Funds.
     The Company, as an investor in these Portfolio Funds is charged management
     fees of up to 3% (per annum) of the NAV of its ownership interests in the
     Portfolio Funds, as well as incentive fees or allocations of up to 20% of
     net profits earned that are attributable to the Company's ownership
     interests in such Portfolio Funds. The Company also generally bears a pro
     rata share of the other expenses of each Portfolio Fund in which it
     invests. Total expenses, including incentive fees or allocations, for the
     year ended March 31, 2011, ranged from approximately 0.51% to 12.38% of the
     Company's average invested capital in each Portfolio Fund. Incentive fees
     or allocations ranged from approximately 0.00% to 8.27% of the Company's
     average invested capital in each Portfolio Fund. These ratios may vary over
     time depending on the allocation of the Company's assets among the
     Portfolio Funds and the actual expenses and investment performance of the
     Portfolio Funds. Although the preceding ranges of Portfolio Fund expense
     ratios are based on audited financial data received from the Portfolio
     Funds, the ranges were not audited by the Company's independent registered
     public accounting firm.

     For the year ended March 31, 2011, aggregate purchases and sales of the
     Portfolio Funds amounted to $133,998,800 and $137,850,084, respectively.

4. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO THE PORTFOLIO FUNDS

     As of March 31, 2011, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments to
     the Portfolio Funds.

5. ADVISORY FEE

     Pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreement between the Company and the
     Adviser, the Company pays the Adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of
     1.00% (the "Advisory Fee") based on the Company's net assets determined as
     of the last business day of each month before taking into consideration the
     Advisory Fee. For the year ended March 31, 2011, the Advisory Fee was
     $5,139,787. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement between the
     Adviser and the Subadviser, the Adviser pays 75% of the Advisory Fee it
     receives from the Company to the Subadviser. The Subadviser is also
     reimbursed by the Company for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
     Subadviser related to the Company, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION
     As part of the Reorganization, the incentive allocation was eliminated as
     of January 1, 2010. Prior to the Reorganization, an incentive allocation
     was calculated with respect to each Member on the last business day of a
     calendar year and upon repurchase of all or any portion of such Investor's
     Interest (an "Incentive Period"). An Incentive Period for each Member's
     Interest started immediately following the preceding Incentive Period and
     ended on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of
     a calendar year; (ii) the next repurchase of all or any portion of such
     Member's Interest; (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser
     (collectively the "Special Members") in connection with such party ceasing
     to serve as Adviser or Subadviser to the Company; or (iv) the dissolution
     of the Company. The aggregate incentive allocation (to the Special Members)
     for an Incentive Period equaled 10% of the amount, if any, in excess of (a)
     profit net of losses (after taking into account expenses, including the
     advisory fee paid by the Company) allocated to each Member's capital
     account for such Incentive Period over (b) the greater of (i) the Member's
     Hurdle Rate Amount for that Incentive Period and (ii) the balance in the
     Member's Loss Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

     A Member's "Loss Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period was zero
     and for each Incentive Period thereafter was equal to the Member's Loss
     Carryforward as of the end of the immediately preceding Incentive Period,
     increased or decreased, but not below zero, by the positive or negative
     difference between the net losses over net profits allocated to the Member
     for the current Incentive Period.

     The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive if its
     Interest as of the beginning of that Incentive Period (adjusted
     appropriately for any additional subscriptions) earned a rate of return
     equal to the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of
     each calendar quarter and reset on the first day of each calendar quarter.
     The Hurdle Rate Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive
     Period.

     In the case of a repurchase of only a portion of an Interest other than on
     the last business day of the calendar year, the Member was treated as
     having two independent Interests in the Company, one of which was being
     repurchased in its entirety. Allocations to the Member and subscriptions
     made by the Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase,
     and the Member's opening capital account balance and Loss Carryforward as
     of the beginning of such Incentive Period, were allocated between the two
     Interests in proportion to the portion of the Member's Interest that was
     repurchased.

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending,
     brokerage, or other business relationships with the Portfolio Funds in
     which the Company invests and with companies in which the Portfolio Funds
     invest.

     The Board is made up of five Directors who are not "interested persons," as
     defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company (the
     "Disinterested Directors"). Until July 1, 2010, the Disinterested Directors
     received an annual retainer of $10,000 and per-meeting fees of: $2,000 for
     in-person attendance at quarterly meetings of the Board; $1,000 for
     telephone participation at a

     quarterly Board meeting or for participation at a telephonic special
     meeting of the Board; and $1,000 for each audit committee meeting (whether
     held in-person or by telephone). In addition to Board-related fees incurred
     by the Company, such fees were also incurred directly by the Feeder Funds.
     Effective July 1, 2010, the Board compensation structure was modified, such
     that the Disinterested Directors now receive an annual retainer of $40,000
     for their services to both the Company and the Feeder Funds, and no longer
     receive any per meeting fees. The retainer is paid by the Company and
     allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds, which no longer incur any direct
     Board-related expenses. All Disinterested Directors may be reimbursed for
     expenses of attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board or
     of any committee thereof and for their expenses, if any, in connection with
     any other service or activity they perform or engage in as Directors. The
     Company incurred $204,500 of retainer and Board-related fees for the year
     ended March 31, 2011, none of which was payable as of March 31, 2011.

     PFPC Trust Company, which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing
     Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the Company's
     assets and provides custodial services for the Company. On July 1, 2010,
     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. sold the outstanding stock of PNC
     Global Investment Servicing Inc. to The Bank of New York Mellon
     Corporation. At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing
     (U.S.) Inc changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.
     BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as administrator and
     accounting agent to the Company and in that capacity provides certain
     accounting, record keeping, investor related services, and regulatory
     administrative services. The Company pays a monthly fee to the custodian
     and the administrator based primarily upon month-end Members' Capital.

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
   RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

     In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and may enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling, writing option contracts, and equity swaps.
     However, as a result of the investments by the Company as a limited partner
     or member, the Company's liability with respect to its investments in the
     Portfolio Funds is generally limited to the NAV of its interest in each
     Portfolio Fund.

     Because the Company is a closed-end investment company, Interests are not
     redeemable at the option of Members and are not exchangeable for interests
     of any other fund. Although the Board in its discretion may cause the
     Company to offer from time to time to repurchase Interests at the Members'
     capital account value, Interests are considerably less liquid than shares
     of funds that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment
     companies. With respect to any offer to repurchase Interests by the
     Company, the aggregate repurchase amount will be determined by the Board in
     its discretion and such repurchase amount may represent only a small
     portion of outstanding Interests. Because the Company's investments in
     Portfolio Funds themselves have limited liquidity, the Company may not be
     able to fund significant repurchases. Members whose Interests are accepted
     for repurchase also bear the risk that the Company's members' capital
     account value may fluctuate significantly between the time that they submit
     their request for repurchase and the date as of which Interests are valued
     for the purpose of repurchase.

<PAGE>

              Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC
                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
                                 March 31, 2011

     As described in the footnotes of the Company's Schedule of Investments and
     in Note 3, some Portfolio Funds have suspended or restricted withdrawals of
     capital, which increases the liquidity risk for the Company. Liquidity risk
     is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting
     obligations associated with financial liabilities. Liquidity could be
     impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured sources of
     financing, an inability to sell assets or to withdraw capital from the
     Portfolio Funds, or unforeseen outflows of cash to meet tender demands.
     This situation may arise due to circumstances outside of the Company's
     control, such as a general market disruption or an operational issue
     affecting the Company or third parties, including the Portfolio Funds.
     Also, the ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market
     participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.

     The Company's capital invested in the Portfolio Funds can be withdrawn on a
     limited basis. As a result, the Company may not be able to liquidate
     quickly some of its investments in the Portfolio Funds in order to meet
     liquidity requirements or respond to market events.

     There are a number of other risks to the Company. Three principal types of
     risk that can adversely affect the Company's investment approach are market
     risk, strategy risk, and manager risk. The Company also is subject to
     multiple manager risks, possible limitations in investment opportunities,
     allocation risks, lack of diversification, and other risks for the Company
     and potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

9. GUARANTEES

     Under the Company's organizational documents, its Directors and officers
     are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance
     of their duties to the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
     business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of
     representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities. The
     Company's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this
     would involve future claims against the Company that have not yet occurred.
     However, based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss due to
     these warranties and indemnities to be remote.

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date these
     financial statements were issued and noted the following:

     At a meeting held on December 16, 2010, the Board of Directors of the
     Company approved the assumption by Grosvenor of the role of investment
     adviser of the Company and of management services provider to the Feeder
     Funds (the "Adviser Transition"), subject to investor approval of a new
     investment advisory agreement with Grosvenor and certain other conditions.
     Grosvenor had been the Subadviser of the Company since its inception in
     2003. The Adviser Transition was proposed because the Adviser no longer
     planned to focus on advising funds with third-party subadvisers and
     Grosvenor was willing to assume advisory and management responsibilities
     for the Company and the Feeder Funds, respectively.

                                 March 31, 2011

     On March 30, 2011, the Company announced a tender offer to repurchase up to
     $53,554,000 of outstanding Interests from its Members. The net asset value
     of Interests will be calculated for this purpose on June 30, 2011. The
     tender offer expired on April 26, 2011.

                                 March 31, 2011

           BOARD CONSIDERATION OF NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

     The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act") requires
that the Investment Advisory Agreement of the Company be approved initially, and
following an initial two-year term, at least annually, by the Company's Board of
Directors (the "Company Board").

     At an in-person meeting of the Company Board held on December 16, 2010, and
in connection with the Adviser Transition the Company Board considered and
approved an investment advisory agreement (the "New Advisory Agreement") with
Grosvenor, as adviser to the Company effective April 1, 2011.

     In making its determination to approve the New Advisory Agreement and to
recommend its approval by Members of the Company, the Company Board considered
all information it deemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the New
Advisory Agreement and the ability of Grosvenor to provide services to the
Company of the same scope and quality as were provided by BACA. The
"independent" members of the Company Board (the "Independent Directors")
reviewed materials furnished by Grosvenor, including information regarding
Grosvenor, its affiliates and personnel, operations and financial condition. At
the meetings, the Company Board also met with representatives of Grosvenor and
discussed various matters relating to the operations of the Company and
Grosvenor and Grosvenor's plans with respect to the management and offering of
alternative investment products, including the Company and the Feeder Funds
(together with the Company, the "Funds"). Representatives of Grosvenor addressed
questions regarding the experience and qualifications of Grosvenor and its
ability to provide the full range of services required for the operations of the
Company and the Feeder Funds, and the Grosvenor representatives assured the
Company Board that Grosvenor did not anticipate that there would be any
reduction or adverse change in the scope, nature or quality of the investment
advisory or other services provided to the Funds. These representatives noted
that a plan would be put into place designed to provide for the continuity of
the investment advisory services under the New Advisory Agreement. They stated
that no departures of personnel of Grosvenor material to the operations of the
Funds are anticipated. Grosvenor representatives also advised the Company Board
that Grosvenor would continue to provide investment advice with no material
changes in operating conditions.

     Based on its review, and after careful consideration of the factors
discussed below, the Company Board (including each of the Independent Directors
of the Company) unanimously approved the New Advisory Agreement. In connection
with the Company Board's review, the Independent Directors of the Company met in
an executive session, during which they were advised by and had the opportunity
to discuss with independent legal counsel various matters relating to the New
Advisory Agreement. The Company Board determined in approving the New Advisory
Agreement that the New Advisory Agreement would enable the Company to obtain
high quality investment advisory services at a cost that is reasonable and
appropriate. No single factor was considered in isolation, nor was any single
factor considered to be determinative to the decision to approve the New
Advisory Agreement.

     In connection with their deliberations, the Independent Directors of the
Company, with the assistance of independent legal counsel, requested, received
and reviewed information regarding the New Advisory Agreement and relevant
materials furnished by Grosvenor and BACA. These materials included information
regarding Grosvenor and its management, history, qualifications, personnel,
operations and financial condition and other pertinent information. In addition,
the representations made by representatives of Grosvenor were considered.

     In considering the New Advisory Agreement, the Company Board considered the
nature, extent and quality of operations and services provided by Grosvenor to
the Company under a subadvisory agreement. It also considered the fact that the
advisory agreement with BACA and the New Advisory Agreement with Grosvenor,
including the terms relating to the services to be performed by Grosvenor, and
the fees payable by the Company, are substantially the same except for the
replacement of the investment adviser, the date of its effectiveness and certain
indemnification and revised notice provisions. The Company Board considered
that, because Grosvenor served as Subadviser of the Company, the retention of
Grosvenor as investment adviser of the Company would have minimal impact on the
day-to-day management of the Company. The Company Board also considered
Grosvenor's capability to manage a fund registered under the 1940 Act, including
the adequacy of Grosvenor's compliance program and resources.

      BOARD CONSIDERATION OF NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)(CONTINUED)

     With respect to the fees payable under the New Advisory Agreement, the
Company Board compared the fees and overall expense levels of the Company to
those of similar funds and other funds with similar investment objectives,
including other funds advised by Grosvenor and its affiliates. In evaluating the
Advisory Fee, the Company Board also took into account the complexity and
quality of the investment management services required by the Company. The
Company Board also considered the investment performance of the Company,
including comparisons of the Company's performance to that of other similar
funds, and the anticipated costs of services to be provided and an estimate of
the profits likely to be realized by Grosvenor from its relationship with the
Company. The Company Board considered the extent to which economies of scale in
costs of providing services would be realized as the Company grows and whether
the fees payable to Grosvenor pursuant to the New Advisory Agreement properly
reflects these economies of scale for the benefit of Members. The potential
benefits to Grosvenor of its relationship with the Company were also considered.
The Company Board viewed as significant the fact that the key personnel of
Grosvenor who currently provide investment advisory services to the Company
would continue to provide services to the Company, and the commitment of
Grosvenor to provide the personnel and utilize such resources as may be needed
to provide services to the Company. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
Board considered the current financial condition and resources of Grosvenor.

     Possible alternatives to approval of the New Advisory Agreement were also
considered by the Company Board. During its review and deliberations, the
Company Board evaluated the potential benefits, detriments and costs to the
Company and Members of the replacement of BACA as the investment adviser. The
Company Board determined that Grosvenor has the requisite expertise, personnel
and resources to enable it to provide high quality services to the Company.

     After consideration, the Company Board noted its overall satisfaction with
the nature, quality and extent of services currently provided by Grosvenor as
Subadviser and concluded that the Company would receive satisfactory services
under the New Advisory Agreement from Grosvenor. The Company Board also
concluded that the Company's performance compared favorably with the performance
of similar funds, and determined that the fees and expense ratio of the Funds
are within the range of the fees and expense ratios of similar funds. It also
concluded that the profitability to Grosvenor from its relationship with the
Funds would not be so disproportionately large that it would bear no reasonable
relationship to the services rendered.

ITEM  2  -  CODE  OF  ETHICS

The Registrant has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR,
applicable to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions. A copy of this code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form
N-CSR. No substantive amendments were approved or waivers were granted to this
code of ethics during the period covered by this report.

ITEM 3 - AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT

The Registrant's Board has determined that each of Alan Brott and Brian P.
Gallagher, both of whom are members of the Audit Committee of the Board, is an
audit committee financial expert as defined by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"). Messrs. Brott and Gallagher are each deemed
"independent" as defined by the SEC for purposes of audit committee financial
expert determinations.

ITEM 4 - PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

(A)  AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and
     March 31, 2011 for professional services rendered by the principal
     accountant for the audit of the Registrant's annual financial statements or
     services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with
     statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years are
     $32,000 and $30,000, respectively.

(B)  AUDIT-RELATED  FEES

     The  aggregate  fees billed for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and
     March 31, 2011 for assurance and related services by the principal
     accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit  of  the Registrant's financial statements and are not reported under
     paragraph  (a) of this Item are $0 and $0, respectively. Audit-related fees
     include  certain  agreed-upon  procedures  performed  for  semi-annual
     shareholder  reports  and  technical  research on accounting and disclosure
     matters.

(C)  TAX FEES

     The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and
     March 31, 2011 for professional services rendered by the principal
     accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning are $24,503 and
     $18,000, respectively.

                                       2

<PAGE>

(D)  ALL OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended March
     31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 for products and services provided by the
     principal accountant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)
     through (c) of this Item are $0 and $0, respectively.

(E)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     The policy of the Registrant's Audit Committee is to consider and, if
     appropriate, approve before the principal accountant is engaged for such
     services, all specific audit and non-audit services (other than certain de
     minimis non-audit services) provided to the Registrant. In making a
     determination, the Audit Committee considers whether the services are
     consistent with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

     In the event of a contingency situation in which the principal accountant
     is needed to provide services in between scheduled Audit Committee
     meetings, the Audit Committee has delegated to its Chairman the
     responsibility for considering and, if appropriate, pre-approving audit or
     permitted non-audit services in an amount sufficient to complete services
     and to determine if such services would be consistent with maintaining the
     accountant's independence. The Audit Committee Chairman is required to
     report to the full Audit Committee as to the nature and amount of such
     services and fees pre-approved at the next scheduled Audit Committee
     meeting. The Audit Committee would again consider whether such services and
     fees are consistent with maintaining the principal accountant's
     independence.

     The Registrant's Audit Committee is informed at least annually of all audit
     and non-audit services provided by the principal accountant to the
     Registrant .

(E)(2)The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this
     Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
     (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the fiscal years ended
     March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 was zero.

(F)  The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's engagement
     to audit the Registrant's financial statements for the most recent fiscal
     year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the
     principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees was less than fifty
     percent.

(G)  The amount of non-audit fees that were billed by the Registrant's
     principal accountant for services rendered to : (i) the Registrant, and
     (ii) the Registrant's investment adviser and any entity controlling,
     controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
     provides ongoing services to the Registrant for the fiscal year ended March
     31, 2011, were $18,000 and $35,000, respectively.

     The amount of non-audit fees that were billed by the Registrant's principal
     accountant for services rendered to : (i) the Registrant, and (ii) the
     Registrant's investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by,
     or under common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing
     services to the Registrant for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, were
     $24,503 and $0, respectively.

(H)  The Registrant's audit committee of the Board has considered whether the
     provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Registrant's
     investment adviser, and any

                                       3

<PAGE>

     entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
     investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that
     were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
     Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
     independence.

ITEM 5 - AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

Not applicable.

ITEM 6 - INVESTMENTS

(A)  Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
     close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
     shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(B)  Not applicable.

ITEM 7 - DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Substantially all of the assets of the Registrant are invested in Grosvenor
Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the "MASTER FUND"). Each the
Registrant and the Master Fund has delegated to Grosvenor Capital Management,
L.P. ("GROSVENOR" or the "FIRM"), the responsibility to vote proxies related to
portfolio securities.

BACKGROUND

Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered investment adviser like Grosvenor to implement proxy voting
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser
votes proxies in the best interests of its clients.

Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-6, Grosvenor has adopted Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures ("PROXY POLICIES") that have been designed to ensure that Grosvenor
votes proxies in the best interests of its clients.

WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS

The most common scenarios in which Grosvenor is requested to respond to proxy
requests relating to securities held by one or more client accounts, including
the Registrant and/or the Master Fund, are as follows:

-    Grosvenor has investment discretion over such client accounts and is
     requested by the investment manager ("INVESTMENT MANAGER") of an underlying
     investment fund in which such client accounts invest ("PORTFOLIO FUND") to
     vote limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests,
     shares or similar equity interests in such Portfolio Fund.

-    A client who invests in an account over which Grosvenor does not have
     investment discretion is requested by the Investment Manager of an
     underlying Portfolio Fund in which such account invests to vote limited
     partnership interests, limited liability company interests, shares or
     similar equity interests in such Portfolio Fund, and such client in turn
     requests Grosvenor to make a recommendation as to how such client should
     respond to such request.

                                       4

<PAGE>

In rare cases, Grosvenor may be requested to vote on (or make recommendations to
clients as to how to vote on) matters relating to fee sharing agreements and
ancillary investments.

For purposes of convenience, a request by an Investment Manager or other party
(other than a client) to vote a security held by a client account, or to vote on
any matter (or consent to any action) relating to a fee sharing agreement, is
referred to below as a "PROXY REQUEST."

MATERIAL  PROPOSALS  AND  IMMATERIAL  PROPOSALS

Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories, those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

Grosvenor defines an "IMMATERIAL PROPOSAL" as a proposal that, if adopted, WOULD
NOT, in its reasonable judgment, either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the relevant client account(s) (e.g., a proposal to
approve a change in the name of a Portfolio Fund, to approve a Portfolio Fund's
previous year's audited financial statements, to approve a Portfolio Fund's
appointment of independent auditors, to elect new directors of a Portfolio Fund,
etc.); or (b) materially adversely change the terms on which future investments
may be made by one or more of Grosvenor's client accounts. In other words, a
proposal that, if adopted, would change any one or more terms in a manner that
is favorable, or not materially adverse, to existing or future client accounts,
is an Immaterial Proposal.

Grosvenor defines a "MATERIAL PROPOSAL" as a proposal that is not an Immaterial
Proposal (i.e., a Material Proposal is a proposal that, if adopted, WOULD, in
Grosvenor's reasonable judgment, either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the relevant client account(s); or (b) materially
adversely change the terms on which future investments may be made by one or
more client accounts).

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A PROXY REQUEST

It is Grosvenor's policy to ACT (or recommend action, as the case may be) on
each Immaterial Proposal, unless Grosvenor's Operations Committee determines
otherwise.

It is Grosvenor's policy to CONSENT (or recommend consent, as the case may be)
to each Immaterial Proposal, unless:

-    the Primary Investment Principal (discussed below) or a member of
     Grosvenor's Operations Committee objects to such Immaterial Proposal; or

-    Grosvenor's Operations Committee determines, based on information provided
     to it by certain persons within the Firm, that consent to such Immaterial
     Proposal would not be consistent with the investment objective(s), policies
     and restrictions of the relevant client account(s). Grosvenor's Operations
     Committee, however, after due consideration, may authorize Grosvenor to act
     favorably (or make a favorable recommendation, as the case may be) on an
     Immaterial Proposal in this situation, upon such terms and subject to such
     conditions as the Operations Committee may determine to be appropriate
     under the circumstances.

Except as discussed below under "MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST," it is
Grosvenor's general policy to ACT (or recommend action, as the case may be) on
each Proxy Request relating to a Material Proposal in accordance with the
recommendation of the employee whom Grosvenor has designated

                                       5

<PAGE>

as the primary investment principal with respect to the Investment Manager or
securities in question ("PRIMARY INVESTMENT PRINCIPAL"), subject to the
following considerations:

-    Any member of Grosvenor's Investment Committee may object to the
     recommendation of a Primary Investment Principal in response to a Proxy
     Request. In the case of any such objection, the matter is referred to
     Grosvenor's Investment Committee, whose decision is final and conclusive,
     except that Grosvenor's Chief Executive Officer or Grosvenor's Operations
     Committee may veto any action proposed to be taken by a Primary Investment
     Principal or by Grosvenor's Investment Committee in response to a Proxy
     Request.

-    Grosvenor's Operations Committee may object to the recommendation of a
     Primary Investment Principal in response to a Proxy Request if it
     determines, based on information provided to it by certain persons within
     the Firm, that consent to such Proxy Request would not be consistent with
     the investment objective(s), policies and restrictions of the relevant
     client account(s). Grosvenor's Operations Committee, however, after due
     consideration, may authorize Grosvenor to act favorably (or make a
     favorable recommendation, as the case may be) on a Proxy Request relating
     to a Material Proposal in this situation, upon such terms and subject to
     such conditions as the Operations Committee may determine to be appropriate
     under the circumstances.

In the case of accounts that Grosvenor manages on a discretionary basis,
Grosvenor ordinarily does not consult with clients prior to taking action on
Proxy Requests that affect such accounts.

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST

Grosvenor expects that Proxy Requests frequently will request approval of
"ADVERSE MEASURES," namely, measures that reduce the rights, powers and
authority, and/or increase the duties and obligations, associated with the
security in question. For example, it is anticipated that Proxy Requests
frequently will request approval of increased fees and/or less favorable
liquidity provisions relating to Portfolio Funds in which one or more of
Grosvenor's client accounts invest.

Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend favorable action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse Measures as
long as such Primary Investment Principal reasonably believes, based on the
totality of the facts and circumstances, that continuing to hold the relevant
security has a reasonable probability of conferring benefits on the relevant
client account(s) (e.g., continued access to a high-quality investment manager)
that outweigh the adverse affect(s) of such Adverse Measure, considered over the
anticipated holding period of such security in the portfolio(s) of the relevant
client account(s).

MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In furtherance of Grosvenor's goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner that best serves the interests of the affected client accounts, Grosvenor
will not implement any decision to respond to (or make a recommendation as to
how to respond to) a Proxy Request in a particular manner unless and until a
Compliance Officer has implemented certain procedures designed to:

-    identify whether Grosvenor is subject to a conflict of interest in taking
     action in response to such Proxy Request;

-    assess the materiality of such a conflict; and

                                       6

<PAGE>

-    address a material conflict in a manner designed to serve the best
     interests of the affected client accounts(s).

A conflict of interest ordinarily will be considered material if it can
reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of its related persons) have a
meaningful incentive to respond to the Proxy Request in a manner designed to
benefit Grosvenor (or any such related person) rather than the affected client
accounts - even if there is no ostensible detriment to the affected client
account(s) from responding to such request in that manner.

In addition, a conflict of interest may be considered material if it can
reasonably be argued that Grosvenor has a meaningful incentive to respond to a
Proxy Request in a manner designed to favor one or more of Grosvenor's clients
over one or more of Grosvenor's other clients.

All materiality determinations are based on an assessment of the particular
facts and circumstances.

If the Compliance Officer determines that Grosvenor (or one or more of its
related persons) is subject to a conflict of interest in taking action in
response to a Proxy Request but that such conflict is not material, he or she
shall issue an instruction to take action in response to such Proxy Request as
provided above under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST."

If the Compliance Officer determines that Grosvenor (or one or more of its
related persons) is subject to a material conflict of interest in taking action
in response to a Proxy Request, he or she shall, in consultation with such other
of its personnel as he or she determines to be appropriate under the
circumstances, determine how to address such conflict.

In determining how to address a material conflict of interest, the Compliance
Officer may consider the following potential solutions, as well as any other
solutions he or she wishes to consider:

-    in the case of a non-discretionary account, disclosing the conflict of
     interest to the appropriate parties;

-    in the case of a discretionary account, disclosing the conflict of
     interest to the appropriate parties and obtaining their consent (in
     accordance with the governing documents of such account) to act on the
     Proxy Request in accordance with the decision reached by Grosvenor with
     respect to such Proxy Request; and

-    in the case of any account, engaging an independent third party to
     recommend a response to the Proxy Request.

In cases where the Compliance Officer determines that Grosvenor (or one or more
of its related persons) is subject to a conflict of interest in responding to a
Proxy Request and that such conflict is material, he or she shall not issue an
instruction to take or recommend action in response to such Proxy Request in
accordance with the decision reached by Grosvenor without first determining that
such action is in the best interests of the affected client account(s).

In certain cases, depending on the interests of particular clients, a Primary
Investment Principal may recommend that certain client accounts vote against a
Material Proposal and that other client accounts vote in favor of such Material
Proposal.

ITEM 8 - PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Substantially all of the assets of the Registrant are invested in the Master
Fund. The portfolio management team of the Master Fund is described below.

The Master Fund's assets are managed by Grosvenor. Grosvenor maintains an
Investment Committee that is responsible for, among other things:

-    overseeing the identification and evaluation of investment strategies that
     may be appropriate for an account managed or advised by Grosvenor (a
     "GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNT"), including the Master Fund, and approving (or
     disapproving) such investment strategies;

-    determining from time to time guidelines specifying the target percentages
     of assets (usually determined as a range) that the Portfolio Management
     Teams (as defined below) generally follow in allocating the assets of
     Grosvenor-Managed Accounts assigned to them to particular investment
     strategies and underlying exposure categories ("FIRMWIDE INVESTMENT
     GOALS");

-    overseeing the identification and evaluation of, and approving (or
     disapproving), Investment Managers (and the Portfolio Funds managed by such
     Investment Managers) that employ investment strategies that have been
     approved by the Investment Committee;

-    establishing the particular investment objectives and investment
     restrictions ("INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND CONSTRAINTS") that will apply to
     Grosvenor's management of each Grosvenor-Managed Account, including the
     Master Fund (in the case of the Master Fund, these Investment Objectives
     and Constraints are subject to approval by the Master Fund's Board of
     Directors); and overseeing the monitoring of investment strategies,
     Investment Managers and Portfolio Funds.

The Investment Committee must approve a particular Investment Manager and
particular Portfolio Fund(s) managed by such Investment Manager from an
"investment" perspective before Grosvenor invests the assets of the Master Fund
in such Portfolio Fund(s). The Investment Committee currently has four members:
Mr. David S. Richter (Chair), Mr. David B. Small, Mr. Brian A. Wolf and Mr.
Bradley H. Meyers. The Investment Committee makes decisions by majority vote;
however, Mr. Michael J. Sacks, Grosvenor's Chief Executive Officer, has a veto
right over all decisions made by the Investment Committee, and is entitled to
cast a deciding vote in the event of a 2-2 tie vote by the members of the
Investment Committee.

Each Grosvenor-Managed Account, including the Master Fund, is assigned to a
particular portfolio management team ("PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TEAM") consisting of
a portfolio manager, a senior portfolio analyst and a junior portfolio analyst.
Mr. David S. Richter and Mr. Bradley H. Meyers, who are members of the
Investment Committee, are responsible for designating the members of each
Portfolio Management Team. Mr. Meyers has general oversight over the functions
of each Portfolio Management Team. Dianna Di Iorio is the portfolio manager of
the designated Portfolio Management Team for the Master Fund. Messrs. Richter
and Meyers review and sign off on each allocation decision for each
Grosvenor-Managed Account, including the Master Fund. Furthermore, Mr. Michael
J. Sacks oversees all portfolio management activity for the Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, including the Master Fund. Accordingly, Messrs. Richter, Meyers and
Sacks may also be deemed to be portfolio managers of the Master Fund.

                                       8

<PAGE>
A brief biography of each of Messrs. Sacks, Richter, Meyers and Ms. Di Iorio
appears below.

The Master Fund's Portfolio Management Team is responsible for constructing the
portfolio of the Master Fund, and for managing such portfolio on a day-to-day
basis, by employing a combination of "top-down" and "bottom-up" inputs. The
"top-down" inputs consist of:

-    the Master Fund's Investment Objectives and Constraints;

-    the requirement to use investment strategies, Investment Managers and
     Portfolio Funds that have been approved by the Investment Committee;

-    the Firmwide Investment Goals applicable to the Master Fund; and

-    the position size target ranges established by the Investment Committee
     relating to the allocation of Master Fund's assets to particular classes of
     Portfolio Funds (and, in some cases, particular Portfolio Funds).

The "bottom-up" inputs consist of the Master Fund's Portfolio Management Team's
judgment in selecting and allocating capital to approved Investment Managers in
a manner that the Portfolio Management Team determines to be appropriate in
light of the Master Fund's Investment Objectives and Constraints and other
investment restrictions. The Portfolio Management Team bases its allocation
decisions upon both qualitative and quantitative factors, supplementing
experienced investment judgment with quantitative analyses.

NOTE: FOR PURPOSES OF THIS BREAKDOWN, LEVERAGE AND INVESTMENTS IN GROSVENOR
SUB-FUNDS ARE NOT INCLUDED.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE. Messrs. Sacks, Richter, Meyers and Ms. Di Iorio each
receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon the success of
the Firm. In addition, each of Messrs. Sacks and Richter holds an equity
participation, which entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not directly
based upon or tied to the performance or net asset value of the Master Fund or
any other accounts managed by the Firm.

OWNERSHIP BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. As of the date of this Form, none of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Master Fund owns any interests in the Master Fund.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

GENERAL

Grosvenor is subject to significant conflicts of interest in managing the
business and affairs of the Master Fund and in making investment decisions for
the Master Fund. Such conflicts could affect Grosvenor's objectivity and the
performance of the Master Fund.

Grosvenor has fiduciary duties to the Master Fund to act in good faith and with
fairness in all its dealings with the Master Fund, and will take such duties
into account in dealing with all actual and potential conflicts of interest.  If
an investor in a Grosvenor-Managed Account, including the Master Fund, believes
that Grosvenor has violated its fiduciary duties, such investor may seek legal
relief under applicable law.  However, it may be difficult for investors to
obtain relief because of the changing nature of the law in this area, the
vagueness of standards defining the required conduct, the broad discretion given
Grosvenor under such Grosvenor-Managed Account's constituent documents, and the
broad exculpatory and indemnification provisions of such constituent documents.

OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Nothing in the constitution documents of a Grosvenor-Managed Account:

-    requires Grosvenor or any of its related persons (which, for purposes of
     the discussion that follows, include persons who either currently are or
     formerly were related to Grosvenor) to devote their full business time to
     the business and affairs of the Master Fund or to the business and affairs
     of the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in general; or

-    limits or restricts Grosvenor or its related persons from engaging in and
     devoting time and attention to other businesses or ventures or from
     rendering services of whatever kind or nature.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Grosvenor and its related
persons may act as investment adviser to or investment manager of
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are not in existence as of the date of this
report - whether or not having investment objectives similar to those of the
Master Fund or other then-existing Grosvenor-Managed Accounts - on terms
(including

                                       11

<PAGE>

terms relating to fees, liquidity and transparency) that are the same as or
different from those available to the Master Fund.

Further, Grosvenor and its related persons may engage in any other businesses or
ventures, including, without limitation, those described below under
"INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS." Grosvenor has no obligation
to make investment opportunities in any such businesses or ventures available to
the Master Fund or any other Grosvenor-Managed Account (or to the
investors/participants in the Master Fund or any other Grosvenor-Managed
Account) and (except to the extent Grosvenor determines otherwise) the Master
Fund and the other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts will not participate in the risks
or rewards of such businesses or ventures.  Further, such businesses and
ventures will:

-    compete with the Master Fund and the other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts for
     the time and attention of Grosvenor and its related persons; and

-    potentially create additional conflicts of interest or raise other special
     considerations, as discussed more fully below.

In addition, Grosvenor and its related persons, in investing and trading for
their proprietary accounts, may (to the extent lawful) make use of information
obtained by them in the course of investing for the Master Fund and other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor and its related persons will have no
obligation to compensate the Master Fund or any other Grosvenor-Managed Account
(or any investor/participant therein) in any respect for their receipt of such
information or to account to the Master Fund or any other Grosvenor-Managed
Account (or any investor/participant therein) for any profits earned from their
use of such information.

INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS

Grosvenor and its related persons may, for their own accounts:

-    invest in other investment management or advisory firms (and investment
     vehicles or accounts managed or advised by such firms);

-    enter into fee-, revenue- and/or profit-sharing agreements with other
     investment management or advisory firms ("FEE SHARING AGREEMENTS"); and/or

-    operate and/or manage other investment management or advisory firms.

Investments in other investment management or advisory firms often (though not
always) are made in exchange for "seeding" or otherwise funding the firms'
operation

Grosvenor has no obligation to make investment opportunities in other investment
management or advisory firms available to the Master Fund or any other
Grosvenor-Managed Account or any investor or participant in any
Grosvenor-Managed Account, and does not currently intend to make investment
opportunities in other investment management or advisory firms available to the
Master Fund.  In any event, because of restrictions imposed by the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the "ICA"), Grosvenor may in certain cases be prohibited
from causing the Master Fund to enter into Fee Sharing Agreements with, or
otherwise invest in, investment management or advisory firms with which
Grosvenor,  one or more of its related persons and/or one or more other

                                       12

<PAGE>

Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have Fee Sharing Agreements or in which Grosvenor,
one or more of its related persons and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts invest.

PLACING ASSETS UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS IN
WHICH GROSVENOR AND/OR ITS RELATED PERSONS HAVE AN INTEREST

Grosvenor and its related persons may place their proprietary assets, as well as
assets of Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts, under the management of investment
management or advisory firms with which Grosvenor (and/or its related persons)
has entered into Fee Sharing Agreements, or in which Grosvenor (and/or its
related persons) has otherwise invested.  Because of restrictions imposed by the
ICA, Grosvenor may in certain cases be prohibited from causing the Master Fund
to place any of the Master Fund's assets under the management of investment
management or advisory firms with which Grosvenor, one or more of its related
persons and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have entered into
Fee Sharing Agreements, or in which Grosvenor, one or more of its related
persons and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have otherwise
invested.

DIFFERENCES IN GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS

Grosvenor and its related persons currently manage or advise numerous
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in addition to the Master Fund, and expect to manage
or advise additional Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in the future. Certain
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have or will have investment objectives that are
identical or substantially similar to the investment objectives of the Master
Fund. It is not anticipated, however, that the Master Fund and other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts having identical or substantially similar investment
objectives will have identical or substantially similar investment portfolios.
Differing investment portfolios can be expected to result from several factors,
including, without limitation, the following:

-    different investment decisions made by the different Portfolio Management
     Teams assigned to the different Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, as discussed
     below;

-    regulatory and/or tax restrictions that apply to certain Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts but not to others, as discussed below;

-    investment constraints imposed by Investment Managers on certain
     Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not on others, as discussed below;

-    the availability of particular Portfolio Funds for investment by
     Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others;

-    different risk/return characteristics (notwithstanding that such
     Grosvenor-Managed Accounts generally have similar investment objectives);

-    client-imposed portfolio management restrictions and/or other client
     instructions; and

-    the amount of cash available for investment by different Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts at certain times.

The Master Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may be managed by different
Portfolio Management Teams even though the Master Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may have identical or substantially similar
investment objectives. Grosvenor's Portfoli

                                       13

<PAGE>

Management Teams are authorized to invest the assets of the Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts for which they have investment responsibility in a wide range of
Portfolio Funds.  As a result, it is expected that the Master Fund and other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts will have different investment portfolios resulting
from different investment decisions made by their respective Portfolio
Management Teams, even if the Master Fund and such other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts have identical or substantially similar investment objectives.
Further, the factors discussed above are likely to result in different
portfolios for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are managed by the same Portfolio
Management Team, even though such Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have identical or
substantially similar investment objectives.

Regulatory and/or tax restrictions may prohibit the Master Fund from
participating in investment opportunities that are available to one or more
other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Similarly, the Investment Managers of the
Portfolio Funds in which the Master Fund may wish to invest may impose
investment restrictions on the Master Fund but not on other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.  Such restrictions could render the Master Fund ineligible to invest,
in whole or in part, in a Portfolio Fund in which one or more other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are free to invest, to the possible detriment of the
Master Fund.

As a result of certain restrictions imposed by the ICA on investments by the
Master Fund in "affiliated persons" (as that term is defined in the ICA) of the
Master Fund, the Master Fund has determined to forego some or all of its voting
rights associated with investments in certain Portfolio Funds.  In addition, in
situations where the Master Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts own, in
the aggregate, 25% or more of the interests in a particular Portfolio Fund, the
Master Fund and the other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may be precluded from
making additional investments in such Portfolio Fund, even though the relevant
Portfolio Management Teams  may determine that it would be appropriate for the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) to make additional
investments in such Portfolio Fund.

As a result of these and other factors:

-    the Master Fund may have a different investment portfolio (and, as a
     result, different performance results) from other Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts even though the Master Fund and such other Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts may have identical or substantially similar investment objectives;
     and

-    no assurance can be given that:

     o    the Master Fund will participate in all investment opportunities in
          which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor's
          proprietary accounts and/or the proprietary accounts of Grosvenor's
          related persons participate;

     o    particular investment opportunities allocated to one or more
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor's proprietary accounts and/or
          the proprietary accounts of Grosvenor's related persons will not
          outperform investment opportunities allocated to the Master Fund; or

     o    the Master Fund, on the one hand, and one or more other
          Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor's proprietary accounts and/or
          the proprietary accounts of Grosvenor's related persons, on the other
          hand, will receive equal or similar treatment.

                                       14

<PAGE>

POSSIBLE INCENTIVE TO FAVOR ONE OR MORE GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS OVER ONE OR
MORE OTHER GROSVENOR-MANAGED ACCOUNTS

Grosvenor's Portfolio Management Teams might have an incentive to favor one or
more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts over the Master Fund (for example, with regard
to the selection of Portfolio Funds for those Grosvenor-Managed Accounts or the
allocation of investment opportunities in Portfolio Funds that have limited
investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) might
pay Grosvenor more for its services than the Master Fund. For example, a
Portfolio Management Team may have an incentive to allocate what it considers to
be the best investment opportunities to Grosvenor-Managed Accounts from which
Grosvenor receives performance-based compensation - in preference to
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) from which Grosvenor does
not receive performance-based compensation - because Grosvenor may stand to gain
greater compensation from the former types of accounts if the best investment
opportunities are allocated to them.

Similarly, a member of one of Grosvenor's Portfolio Management Teams may have an
incentive to favor one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts over the Master Fund
if such person has personal investments in such "favored" Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.

As discussed below under "GROSVENOR'S ABILITY TO INVEST IN THE SAME SECURITIES
IN WHICH THE MASTER FUND INVESTS," Grosvenor has adopted portfolio opportunity
allocation policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that investment
opportunities are fairly allocated to all Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (as well as
the proprietary accounts of Grosvenor and its related persons) for which such
opportunities are appropriate and that have the funds available to take
advantage of such opportunities.

GROSVENOR'S ABILITY TO INVEST IN THE SAME SECURITIES IN WHICH THE MASTER FUND
INVESTS

Grosvenor and/or its related persons may invest in Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
(including the Master Fund) for their own accounts alongside investors who are
not related to them. When they do so, Grosvenor and/or its related persons
participate in the investment opportunities in which such Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts participate, alongside the other investors in such Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.

In addition, Grosvenor and/or its related persons may place assets under the
management of (or otherwise procure investment advisory or investment management
services from) any Investment Manager directly or indirectly used by one or more
of Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund). For example,
Grosvenor and/or its related persons may invest in a Portfolio Fund in which one
or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) invest. Further,
Grosvenor and/or its related persons may invest in a Portfolio Fund at or about
the same time one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund)
invest in such Portfolio Fund.

Grosvenor, its related persons and one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that
place assets under the management of, or otherwise procure investment advisory
or investment management services from, any Investment Manager directly or
indirectly used by the Master Fund and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts may do so on terms (including terms relating to fees, liquidity and
transparency) that are more advantageous than those applicable to the
investments that may be made by the Master Fund and/or such other
Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) with such Investment Manager. To the extent that
Grosvenor and/or its related persons invest with a give Investment Manager on
terms that are more advantageous than those on which the Master Fund

                                       15

<PAGE>

and/or one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may invest with such
Investment Manager, Grosvenor and/or its related persons may have an incentive
to maintain or increase the investment by the Master Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts with such Investment Manager in order to obtain
and/or maintain such advantageous terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and/or its
related persons.

In certain cases, a Portfolio Fund may have what Grosvenor refers to as "limited
capacity." A Portfolio Fund has "limited capacity" when it is not willing to
accept all capital that Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and/or Grosvenor's
related persons wish to invest in such Portfolio Fund.  If Grosvenor and/or its
related persons wish to invest in such a Portfolio Fund at a time when an
investment in such Portfolio Fund is appropriate for the Master Fund, Grosvenor
has a conflict of interest because it has a financial incentive to allocate the
opportunity to the greatest extent possible to Grosvenor and/or its related
persons. In order to avoid this conflict, Grosvenor may determine in certain
cases that it and/or its related persons will not directly participate in a
Portfolio Fund that has "limited capacity" unless and until all
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) that wish to invest in
such Portfolio Fund (including, for this purpose, Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in
which Grosvenor and/or its related persons participate) have invested the full
amount of capital they wish to invest in such Portfolio Fund.

In other cases, Grosvenor employs policies and procedures for allocating limited
investment opportunities in a manner that it believes to be equitable to the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and Grosvenor's related persons.  Under
these policies and procedures, to the extent that one or more Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts (including the Master Fund), Grosvenor and/or Grosvenor's related
persons (each of the foregoing, a "PARTICIPATING ACCOUNT") wish to invest in a
particular Portfolio Fund (and have funds available to make such investment) but
such Portfolio Fund has "limited capacity" and is willing to accept only a
portion of the aggregate investment that the Participating Accounts wish to
make, the aggregate capacity made available by such Portfolio Fund to the
Participating Accounts generally is allocated to each Participating Account in
the proportion that the amount such Participating Account wishes to invest in
such Portfolio Fund bears to the aggregate amount that all Participating
Accounts wish to invest in such Portfolio Fund, subject the investment
guidelines and constraints applicable to such Participating Account and to
certain limited exceptions set forth in such policies and procedures.
(Similarly, if interests in a Portfolio Fund are available in the "secondary
market" but such interests are not available in an amount sufficient to satisfy
the aggregate amount that Participating Accounts wish to invest in such
interests, such interests generally are allocated to each Participating Account
that has funds available to make such investment in the proportion that the
amount such Participating Account wishes to invest in such interests bears to
the aggregate amount that all Participating Accounts wish to invest in such
interests, subject the investment guidelines and constraints applicable to such
Participating Account and to certain limited exceptions set forth in such
policies and procedures).

GROSVENOR'S ABILITY TO WITHDRAW/REDEEM FROM INVESTMENTS IN WHICH GROSVENOR-
MANAGED ACCOUNTS INVEST

Certain Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) may wish to
withdraw/redeem from an underlying Portfolio Fund at the same time that other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and its related persons) wish to
withdraw/redeem from such Portfolio Fund.  The ability to withdraw/redeem from
any underlying Portfolio Fund may differ materially from

                                       16

<PAGE>

investor to investor due to the timing of their respective investments in such
Portfolio Fund, the different classes of interests in such Portfolio Fund in
which they invest, special arrangements negotiated with the Investment Manager
of such Portfolio Fund and/or other factors. The reasons why certain
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts may wish (or be compelled to) withdraw/redeem from a
particular Portfolio Fund as of a particular date also may differ materially
from the reasons why other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and its
related persons) may wish (or be compelled to) withdraw/redeem from such
Portfolio Fund as of such date.  Withdrawals/redemptions or subscriptions by
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and/or Grosvenor's related persons from or
to a particular Portfolio Fund could in certain cases adversely affect other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are invested in such Portfolio Fund.
Significant withdrawals/redemptions or subscriptions could, for example, cause
portfolio damage, portfolio dilution, depletion of liquidity, costly portfolio
rebalancings, imposition of withdrawal "gates" and under-allocation to certain
positions.  It could also cause a Portfolio Fund to make "in-kind" (as opposed
to cash) distributions.  In cases such as these, Grosvenor has a conflict of
interest in making withdrawals/redemptions or subscriptions for
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  This conflict of interest could be exacerbated in
situations where one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and
its related persons) may withdraw/redeem from a particular Portfolio Fund on a
date as of which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the
Master Fund) are not able to do so.  For example, certain Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and its related persons) may have invested in a
particular Portfolio Fund pursuant to a "lock-up" that has expired, whereas one
or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) may still
be subject to "lock-ups" in connection with their investments in such Portfolio
Fund because they either (i) purchased their interests in such Portfolio Fund
subsequent to the time that other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and
Grosvenor's related persons purchased their interests in such Portfolio Fund or
(ii) opted for liquidity classes in such Portfolio Fund that are different from
the liquidity classes owned by such other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor
and Grosvenor's related persons.

In addition, certain withdrawal/redemption "gates" are, for example, calculated
based on withdrawals/redemptions during an entire quarter or other period, so
that if certain Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and its related
persons) withdraw/redeem during a quarter, this could prevent one or more other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) from
withdrawing/redeeming at quarter-end, whereas the earlier
withdrawals/redemptions are unaffected.

In sum, because the ability to withdraw/redeem from any underlying Portfolio
Fund may differ materially from investor to investor due to the timing of their
respective investments in such Portfolio Fund, the different classes of
interests in such Portfolio Fund in which they invest, special arrangements
negotiated with the Investment Manager of such Portfolio Fund and/or other
factors, certain Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and/or Grosvenor and its related
persons) may have withdrawal/redemption rights that differ from those of the
Master Fund, and that the exercise of such rights could have a materially
adverse effect on the Master Fund.

TREATMENT AS AN INVESTMENT GROUP FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS BY GROSVENOR-MANAGED
ACCOUNTS

In certain cases, although each investment in a Portfolio Fund by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is a distinct transaction, Portfolio Funds may agree
to treat all investments made by Grosvenor-Managed Accounts as if they had been
made by the same investor for purposes of applying business terms such as
"gates."  Grosvenor enters into these types of arrangements because it believes
that in

                                       17

<PAGE>

most cases they can be expected to benefit all participating Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts. However, under arrangements such as these, certain Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts could make complete withdrawals/redemptions provided that other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts do not withdraw/redeem, as the former
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts could make use of the withdrawal/redemption capacity
allocable to the entire "group."  For example, if a Grosvenor-Managed Account
that is treated as part of such a "group" were to withdraw/redeem from a
Portfolio Fund because such Grosvenor-Managed Account itself has received
significant withdrawal/redemption requests, wishes to rebalance its portfolio or
otherwise requires liquidity, its withdrawal/redemption could reduce
withdrawal/redemption capacity for other members of the "group."  In this
example, depending on the actual terms of the applicable "gate," a particular
Grosvenor-Managed Account that participates in a " group" may be entitled to
receive less withdrawal/redemption proceeds in respect of a particular
withdrawal/redemption than would be the case had such Grosvenor-Managed Account
not participated in such "group."

In certain cases, Grosvenor is able to negotiate favorable investment terms with
the Investment Managers of Portfolio Funds, but often on the condition that the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (which, in certain cases, could include proprietary
accounts of Grosvenor and its related persons) collectively maintain an
aggregate minimum level of invested capital in a given Portfolio Fund or group
of Portfolio Funds managed by the same Investment Manager.  The need to maintain
an aggregate minimum investment by Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in a particular
Portfolio Fund or group of Portfolio Funds managed by the same Investment
Manager in order to retain favorable investment terms for all Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that invest in such Portfolio Fund(s) creates a conflict of interest in
that it creates an incentive for Grosvenor to cause a Grosvenor-Managed Account
to invest in or not to withdraw/redeem from a given Portfolio Fund in order to
maintain the minimum threshold investment.  Proprietary capital of Grosvenor and
its related persons - whether invested directly in a Portfolio Fund or through a
Grosvenor-Managed Account in which Grosvenor and/or its related persons invest -
may be among the capital that benefits from the minimum investment threshold
being maintained, creating an additional conflict of interest.

Although Grosvenor enters into the types of arrangements discussed above because
it believes that they generally can be expected to benefit all Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, there may be particular facts and circumstances under which particular
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (including the Master Fund) would receive more
favorable treatment had they not participated in such arrangements.

INVESTMENTS IN "EARLY STAGE" PORTFOLIO FUNDS

Grosvenor and its related persons may from time to time invest, for their
respective proprietary accounts, in early-stage Portfolio Funds (including
Grosvenor-Administered Funds, discussed below) at times when investments in such
Portfolio Funds would not be appropriate for the Master Fund or other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  If Grosvenor should subsequently determine, in
accordance with its then-current criteria applicable to the selection of
Portfolio Funds for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, that such a Portfolio Fund
is an appropriate investment for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and
its related persons will not be required to restructure the terms on which they
invest in such Portfolio Fund in order to make investments in such Portfolio
Fund available to the Master Fund if, for regulatory or other reasons, the
Master Fund would be (or, in Grosvenor's reasonable determination, may be)
precluded from investing in such Portfolio Fund in the absence of such
restructuring.

INVESTMENTS IN GROSVENOR-ADMINISTERED FUNDS

Grosvenor and its related persons may from time to time invest, for their
respective proprietary accounts, in Portfolio Funds that Grosvenor administers
(but does not manage) and from which Grosvenor receives administrative or
similar fees ("GROSVENOR-ADMINISTERED FUNDS"). Because of restrictions imposed
by the ICA, it is not likely that Grosvenor will ever cause the Master Fund to
invest in a Grosvenor-Administered Fund.

INVESTMENTS BY PORTFOLIO FUNDS IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY GROSVENOR

Certain of the Portfolio Funds in which the Master Fund invests may hold notes
or other securities issued from time to time by Grosvenor or its parent company,
and Grosvenor may be aware that such Portfolio Funds do so.  The fact that
certain Portfolio Funds may hold notes or other securities issued by Grosvenor
or its parent company could, under certain facts and circumstances, potentially
alter Grosvenor's objectivity in determining whether or not to invest in such
Portfolio Funds and/or whether or not to withdraw/redeem from such Portfolio
Funds.  Grosvenor does not expect, however, that it would ever make portfolio
management decisions for the Master Fund that would be different from the
decisions it would make for the Master Fund if such potential conflict did not
exist.

INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS MANAGED BY CLIENTS

Certain of the Portfolio Funds in which the Master Fund invests may be managed
by investment management firms owned in whole or in part by Grosvenor's clients,
or may hold notes or other securities issued by Grosvenor's clients, and
Grosvenor may be aware of such investments.  The fact that certain of the
Portfolio Funds may be managed by investment management firms owned in whole or
in part by Grosvenor's clients, or may hold notes or other securities issued by
Grosvenor's clients, could, under certain facts and circumstances, potentially
alter Grosvenor's objectivity in determining whether or not to invest in such
Portfolio Funds and/or whether or not to withdraw/redeem from such Portfolio
Funds. Grosvenor does not expect, however, that it would ever make portfolio
management decisions for the Master Fund that would be different from the
decisions it would make for the Master Fund if such potential conflict did not
exist.

DIFFERENT REPORTING PACKAGES

Different investors/participants in Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, as well as
certain other persons (including persons who currently have, or who previously
have had, a direct or indirect interest in Grosvenor or who otherwise currently
are, or who previously have been, associated with Grosvenor), receive oral
and/or written reports from Grosvenor that differ in form, substance, level of
detail, timing and/or frequency, based on factors such as:

-    the size of their investments with Grosvenor;

-    requests for specific types of information made by such
     investors/participants or persons acting on their behalf;

-    negotiations between Grosvenor and such investors/participants or other
     persons acting on their behalf; and/or

                                       19

<PAGE>

-    Grosvenor's internal assessment of the likely reporting needs of such
     investors/participants or of persons acting on their behalf.

In particular, certain reports may include information relating to Portfolio
Funds in which the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Master Fund, invest
(or in which they are contemplating an investment).

While Grosvenor provides information to investors/recipients in the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts to enable them to monitor their investments in those
accounts, Grosvenor cannot effectively prevent an investor/recipient who has
received information that has not been provided to other recipients to use such
information to determine whether to:

-    withdraw/redeem from a Grosvenor-Managed Account, or increase its
     investment in a Grosvenor-Managed Account;

-    invest directly in Portfolio Funds in which Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are
     invested (or in which they are contemplating investments), potentially in
     competition with the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts; or

-    withdraw/redeem from Portfolio Funds in which Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
     are invested (or from which they are contemplating withdrawing/redeeming
     their investments), potentially to the detriment of the Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts.

Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on
investors/participants who do not receive the same information provided to other
investors/participants.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, recipients of Grosvenor's oral and written
reports should be aware that:

-    Grosvenor does not permit such recipients to copy, transmit or distribute
     such reports, or any data or other information contained therein, in whole
     or in part, or authorize such actions by others, without Grosvenor's
     express prior written consent; any such action taken without Grosvenor's
     express prior written consent may constitute a breach of contract and
     applicable copyright laws, and

-    by their receipt of such reports, such recipients will be deemed to have
     acknowledged that: (i) the data and/or other information contained therein
     may include data and/or information that, under applicable law, may be
     deemed to be material, nonpublic information regarding particular
     securities and/or the issuers thereof; (ii) under certain circumstances,
     United States securities laws prohibit the purchase and sale of securities
     by persons or entities who are in possession of material, nonpublic
     information relating to such securities and/or the issuers thereof; (iii)
     securities laws of other jurisdictions may contain a similar prohibition;
     and (iv) as a result, it is possible that trading in securities that are
     the subject of data and/or information contained in such reports may be
     prohibited by law.

Grosvenor strongly encourages all recipients of its oral or written reports to
review their own policies and procedures relating to the possible receipt of
material, non-public information to ensure that any information that they
receive from Grosvenor relating to particular securities and/or the issuers
thereof will not be used in any manner that conflicts with applicable law.

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The Portfolio Management Team assigned to one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
(each, a "DIVESTING ACCOUNT") may determine that it is appropriate for such
Divesting Accounts to dispose of (or decrease) their investments  in a
particular Portfolio Fund as of a particular date, while the Portfolio
Management Team assigned to one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (each,
an "INVESTING ACCOUNT") - which may be the same Portfolio Management Team
responsible for the management of the Divesting Accounts -  may determine that
it is appropriate for such Investing Accounts to invest (or increase their
investments) in such Portfolio Fund as of the same date.

In certain cases, Grosvenor will implement decisions such as these by causing a
Divesting Account to withdraw/redeem its interest from a Portfolio Fund at the
net asset value thereof (as calculated and reported by the Investment Manager of
such Portfolio Fund), and simultaneously causing an Investing Account to invest
in an interest in such Portfolio Fund at the net asset value thereof.
In other cases, Grosvenor will implement such decisions by causing a Divesting
Account to assign its interest in a Portfolio Fund to an Investing Account in
exchange for a cash payment from the Investing Account equal to the net asset
value of the interest being assigned to the Investing Account (as calculated and
reported by the Investment Manager of such Portfolio Fund).

For purposes of convenience:

-    Grosvenor refers to transactions of the types discussed above as
     "transfers" (even though the first types of transactions discussed above do
     not involve any transfer between the affected Grosvenor-Managed Accounts,
     but only a divestment from a Portfolio Fund by one or more
     Grosvenor-Managed Accounts and a substantially simultaneous investment in
     such Portfolio Fund by one or more other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts);

-    Grosvenor refers to a transaction in which a Divesting Account
     withdraws/redeems its interest from a Portfolio Fund (in whole or in part)
     at the net asset value thereof, while an Investing Account substantially
     simultaneously invests (or increases its investment) in such Portfolio
     Fund, as a "cash transfer;" and

-    Grosvenor refers to a transaction in which a Divesting Account assigns its
     interest in a Portfolio Fund (in whole or in part) at the net asset value
     thereof to an Investing Account, as a "book entry transfer."

In certain cases, Grosvenor is able to negotiate arrangements with Investment
Managers-either at the inception of Grosvenor's relationship with an Investment
Manager or on a case-by-case basis after Grosvenor has established such a
relationship-that permit a Grosvenor-Managed Account that is the "cash
transferee" or "book entry transferee" of an interest in such Investment
Manager's Portfolio Fund to "stand in the shoes" of the transferor
Grosvenor-Managed Account for purposes of determining such business terms as the
duration of any "lock-up period," the continuation of any performance/incentive
fee or other performance/incentive compensation  "loss carryforwards," the
applicability of withdrawal charges, etc.   Grosvenor generally intends to take
advantage, to the fullest extent permitted by law, of the ability of transferee
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts to receive "carryover" business terms.   In certain
cases, however, regulatory considerations may prohibit Grosvenor from effecting
transactions in which business terms are carried over from the transferor
Grosvenor-Managed Account to the transferee Grosvenor-Managed Account.  For
example, ERISA does not permit any such "carryover" business terms to apply in
the case of transfers of interests in

                                       21

<PAGE>

Portfolio Funds by Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are subject to ERISA to any
other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, regardless of whether the transferee
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts are subject to ERISA.  ERISA, however, does not
appear to prohibit "carryover" business terms applying in the case of transfers
from Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are not subject to ERISA to
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are subject to ERISA. Accordingly,
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are not subject to ERISA, including the Master
Fund, may not be able to take advantage of arrangements of the type discussed
above even though Grosvenor-Managed Accounts that are subject to ERISA may.

The Master Fund will not participate in "book entry transfers" because of
restrictions imposed by the ICA. To the extent the Master Fund participates in
"cash transfers," in no instance will any party, including Grosvenor or the
Investment Manager of any affected Portfolio Fund, receive any additional
compensation specifically as a result of any such cash transfer.

TRADE AND CLERICAL ERRORS

Subject to the considerations set forth below, Grosvenor is under no obligation
to reimburse the Master Fund for any errors or mistakes made by Grosvenor, its
employees or its agents with respect to placing or executing trades for the
Master Fund or for any other administrative or clerical errors or mistakes made
by the foregoing (collectively, "TRADE OR CLERICAL ERRORS"), as Grosvenor
considers such errors and mistakes to be a cost of doing business.  However,
pursuant to the standard of care provisions of the Master Fund's operating
agreement, Grosvenor will be obligated to reimburse the Master Fund for losses
sustained by the Master Fund as a result of any Trade or Clerical Error that is
caused by Grosvenor's failure to adhere to the standard of care set forth in
such provisions.  Subject to its fiduciary obligations, Grosvenor will
determine: (i) whether or not any Trade or Clerical Error is required to be
reimbursed in accordance with such standard of care provisions; and (ii) if so,
the extent of the loss that has been incurred by the Master Fund.  Grosvenor has
an inherent conflict of interest with respect to determining whether or not a
Trade or Clerical Error is required to be reimbursed in accordance with the
applicable standard of care provisions and with respect to determining the
extent of the loss that has been incurred by the Master Fund.

If a Trade or Clerical Error occurs other than as a result of Grosvenor's
failure to adhere to the applicable standard of care, Grosvenor, in its sole
discretion, reserves the right to reimburse the Master Fund for any losses
sustained by the Master Fund as a result of such Trade or Clerical Error.
Grosvenor's reimbursement of the Master Fund for a Trade or Clerical Error in
such a situation will not constitute a waiver of Grosvenor's general policy to
cause the Master Fund to bear the losses associated with other Trade or Clerical
Errors that occur other than as a result of Grosvenor's failure to adhere to the
applicable standard of care.  Any net gain resulting from Trade or Clerical
Errors will be for the benefit of the Master Fund and will not be retained by
Grosvenor.

RECEIPT OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Grosvenor may from time to time receive, from Investment Managers of the
Portfolio Funds in which the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts invest, information that
is not generally known to other investors in such Portfolio Funds.  In these
cases, legal or regulatory constraints could prevent Grosvenor from acting in
the manner in which it otherwise would act on behalf of one or more
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Master Fund.

                                       22

<PAGE>

PROXY VOTING

Grosvenor has developed certain policies and procedures to manage the conflicts
of interest that may arise in connection with voting proxies on behalf of the
Master Fund and the other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  These policies and
procedures are summarized in Item 17 of Part 2A of Grosvenor's SEC Form ADV and
in Item 7 of this Form N-CSR.

BROKERAGE EXPENSES

Except in the very limited case of any potential "secondary market" transactions
in interests in Portfolio Funds, the Master Fund invests in Portfolio Funds
without the involvement of any financial intermediary such as a broker-dealer,
and commissions are not payable in connection with such investments.  To the
extent that the Master Fund engages in "secondary market" transaction in
interests in Portfolio Funds or purchases or sells investments other than
investments in Portfolio Funds, Grosvenor has  the authority to determine the
financial intermediaries to be used in connection with such
transactions/investments and to negotiate the amount of commissions or other
transactional compensation to be paid to such intermediaries in connection with
such transactions/investments - which commissions or other compensation are
borne by the Master Fund.

In determining which intermediaries to use, Grosvenor focuses on the quality of
the execution-related services provided by the intermediaries (including factors
such as the ability of the intermediaries to execute transactions efficiently,
their responsiveness to instructions, their facilities, their reliability and
their financial stability), and does not necessarily select those that charge
the lowest commissions or other transactional costs.

Grosvenor does not separately compensate financial intermediaries for the
provision of non-execution related services and does not  believe that it "pay
ups" for such services. However, Grosvenor may from time to time use financial
intermediaries that provide research-related products or services to most or all
of their customers, and - although Grosvenor does not request research-related
products or services from such financial intermediaries - Grosvenor may on
occasion receive and use research provided by such intermediaries.  In this
situation, Grosvenor receives a benefit because it does not have to produce or
pay for the research.  Accordingly, Grosvenor may have an incentive to select
financial intermediaries based on its interest in receiving the research or
other products or services rather than on its clients' interest in receiving the
most favorable execution.  However, since the research provided is not material
in nature and quantity and is provided without Grosvenor's request, Grosvenor
believes that its receipt of such research does not have a material effect on
its selection of financial intermediaries.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CONSULTING FIRMS

Persons employed by or otherwise associated with Grosvenor may be related by
blood or marriage to, or otherwise have personal relationships with, persons
employed by or otherwise associated with consulting firms.  In certain cases,
such persons employed by or otherwise associated with consulting firms may be
responsible for:

-    analyzing and/or monitoring "fund of funds" investment managers on behalf
     of such consulting firms;

-    recommending "fund of funds" investment managers to the investment
     committees or similar governing committees of such consulting firms;

                                       23

<PAGE>

-    selecting the "funds of funds" investment managers that such consulting
     firms will present to their clients as potential managers of such clients'
     assets;

-    recommending particular "fund of funds" investment managers to clients of
     such consulting firms;

-    recommending that clients of such consulting firms continue to retain the
     services of, or discharge, "fund  of funds" investment managers; and/or

-    otherwise playing an instrumental role in the process whereby clients of
     such consulting firms select, and/or retain or discharge, "fund of funds"
     investment managers.

In cases where persons employed by or otherwise associated with consulting firms
have one or more responsibilities of the types discussed  above and are related
by blood or marriage to, or otherwise have personal relationships with, persons
employed by or otherwise associated with Grosvenor, such persons may have an
incentive to select Grosvenor as a potential manager of the assets of clients of
such consulting firms, to recommend Grosvenor to clients of such consulting
firms and/or to recommend that clients of such consulting firms continue to
utilize Grosvenor's services.

Grosvenor believes that is the responsibility of consulting firms to recuse
interested individuals or take other appropriate steps to protect the integrity
of their decision-making processes, and to make appropriate disclosures of
potential conflicts of interest to their clients.  Grosvenor urges prospective
investors who utilize the services of consulting firms to inquire of such
consulting firms whether they are subject to such a conflict of interest.

Grosvenor may from time to time enter into arrangements with consulting firms
that represent existing and prospective clients, pursuant to which such
consulting firms provide Grosvenor certain performance or other data on the
"fund of funds" industry.  Grosvenor may compensate such a consulting firm for
such services on an annual flat-fee or other basis.  In no event will Grosvenor
enter into any such arrangement unless it first determines to its reasonable
satisfaction that the firm that provides services to Grosvenor for compensation
from Grosvenor discloses that fact to all clients to whom it recommends
Grosvenor.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS

Persons employed by or otherwise associated with Grosvenor may be related by
blood or marriage to, or otherwise have personal relationships with, persons
employed by or otherwise associated with the Investment Managers of existing or
prospective Portfolio Funds or with other third-parties that provide or
contemplate providing services to Grosvenor and/or one or more Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.  In certain cases, such persons employed by or otherwise associated
with Grosvenor may be responsible for:

-    analyzing and/or monitoring existing or prospective Portfolio Funds
     managed by such Investment Managers, or analyzing and/or monitoring other
     third-parties that provide or contemplate providing services to Grosvenor
     and/or one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts;

                                       24

<PAGE>

-    recommending that Grosvenor approve Portfolio Funds managed by such
     Investment Managers as eligible investments for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts;

-    recommending that one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts add capital to,
     or withdraw their capital (in whole or in part) from, Portfolio Funds
     managed by such Investment Managers;

-    making the final decision to approve Portfolio Funds managed by such
     Investment Managers as eligible investments for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts;

-    making the final decision to cause one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts
     to add capital to, or withdraw their capital (in whole or in part) from,
     Portfolio Funds managed by such Investment Managers;

-    recommending that Grosvenor retain other third-parties that wish to
     provide services to Grosvenor and/or one or more Grosvenor-Managed
     Accounts; and/or

-    recommending that Grosvenor discharge third-parties that provide services
     to one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

In cases where persons employed by or otherwise associated with Grosvenor have
one or more responsibilities of the types discussed above and are related by
blood or marriage to, or otherwise have personal relationships with, persons
employed by or otherwise associated with Investment Managers of existing or
prospective Portfolio Funds or other third-parties that provide or contemplate
providing services to Grosvenor and/or one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts,
such persons may have an incentive to base their decisions on personal
considerations rather than on the best interests of the affected
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.  Grosvenor, however, monitors relationships of these
types with a view to determining whether there is a reasonable likelihood that
such persons will base their decisions on personal considerations rather than on
the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, and will take
appropriate action if it determines that such a reasonable likelihood exists.

GIFTS, MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT

Grosvenor personnel may receive gifts, meals and/or entertainment from service
providers doing business with Grosvenor and/or one or more Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, or from prospective service providers, including existing and
prospective Investment Managers.  Grosvenor maintains policies and procedures
that it believes are reasonably designed to preserve Grosvenor's objectivity
with respect to the selection, retention and termination of service providers,
notwithstanding the receipt of gifts, meals and/or entertainment by Grosvenor
personnel from such service providers.  However, notwithstanding these policies
and procedures, to the extent that Grosvenor's employees receive gifts, meals
and/or entertainment from a service provider or prospective service provider,
such employees may have an incentive to seek to cause Grosvenor and/or one or
more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts to enter into a business relationship with, or
to sustain or expand an existing business relationship with, such service
provider even if doing so is not in the best interests of such Grosvenor-Managed
Account(s).

Grosvenor from time to time provides meals and entertainment to persons employed
by or otherwise associated with consultants, financial advisors, clients and
prospective clients (which

                                       25

<PAGE>

may include investors and prospective investors in the Feeder Funds).  In
certain cases, Grosvenor may provide such meals and entertainment to clients or
prospective clients at the request of consultants, financial planners or other
third-parties.  It is possible that providing meals and entertainment to such
persons could affect their decision-making responsibilities.

CHARITABLE AND PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES

Grosvenor and its principals, and Investment Managers of the Portfolio Funds in
which the Master Fund invests and their principals, may engage in philanthropic
activities through contributions of their time and/or financial resources to
charitable organizations.   Grosvenor and its principals, on the one hand, and
such Investment Managers and their principals, on the other hand, may from time
to time ask each other to participate in their respective philanthropic
activities.  Grosvenor and its principals, and such Investment Managers and
their principals, are free to participate in philanthropic opportunities brought
to their attention by one another.  Under no circumstances will such
participation or lack thereof be a factor in Grosvenor's investment management
process.

Similarly, Grosvenor and its principals, and investors/participants in
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts and their principals, may engage in philanthropic
activities through contributions of their time and/or financial resources to
charitable organizations. Grosvenor and its principals, on the one hand, and
investors/participants in Grosvenor-Managed Accounts and their principals, on
the other hand, may from time to time ask each other to participate in their
respective philanthropic activities.  Grosvenor and its principals, and
investors/participants in Grosvenor-Managed Accounts and their principals, are
free to participate in philanthropic opportunities brought to their attention by
one another.  Under no circumstances will such participation or lack thereof be
a factor in Grosvenor's investment management process.

Grosvenor has frequent interaction with consultants and financial advisors who
represent prospective and existing investors/participants in Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, including investors/participants that are subject to ERISA.
Grosvenor does not pay these consultants or financial advisors to recommend
Grosvenor or any Grosvenor-Managed Account to their clients.  However,
consultants and financial advisors have from time to time invited Grosvenor and
its principals to participate in particular philanthropic activities, and can be
expected to continue to do so in the future.  Grosvenor has participated in such
philanthropic activities in the past and can be expected to continue to do so in
the future.  Under no circumstances will such participation or lack thereof be a
factor in Grosvenor's investment management process.

                                   Item 2 of Form N-CSR
</TABLE>

I.  OVERVIEW  AND  STATEMENT

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified annual and semi-annual shareholder reports, requires
a registered management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to the investment company's principal
executive officer and senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such
a code of ethics, why it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers
from, the code of ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Business Conduct, which
sets forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

II.  POLICY

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following policy in order to comply with
the requirements as outlined below:

1.   COVERED  OFFICERS/PURPOSE  OF  THE  CODE

     This Code of Business Conduct (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal
     Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting
     Officer or Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of
     promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in
          other public communications made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
     and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest.

2.   ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

     Except as otherwise designated by the Board, the CCO shall be primarily
     responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the
     absence of the Code Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code
     Officer, but only on a temporary basis.

     The  Chief Legal Officer (the "CLO") of the Fund shall assist the Fund's
     Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code Officer, in
     consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this Code to
     specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate)
     and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

3.   MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's personal interest
     interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the Fund. For
     example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
     member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
     result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund. Certain provisions
     in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Advisers
     Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern certain conflicts of
     interest that arise out of the relationships between Covered Officers and
     the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity with applicable
     provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed to
     have been handled ethically. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
     programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
     violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
     repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is
     consistent with such programs and procedures falls outside of the
     parameters of this Code.

     Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper personal
     benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
     relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser,
     administrator, principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or
     transfer agent (each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered
     Officers may also be officers or employees. As a result, this Code
     recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
     duties (whether formally for the Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or
     for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions
     that will have different effects on the Primary Service Providers and the
     Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
     inherent in the contractual relationships between the Fund and the Primary
     Service Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
     Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. If such conflicts are
     addressed in conformity with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the
     Advisers Act, they will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In
     addition, it is recognized by the Board of the Fund that the Covered
     Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other investment
     companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of the Fund covered
     by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those other
     investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers
     acting in such capacities for such other investment companies.

     This Code covers generalconflicts of interest and other issues applicable
     to the Fund under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The overarching principle
     is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
     improperly before the interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such
     conflicts of interest follow.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
          relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
          financial reporting by the Fund

Grosvenor Registered Funds                                           Page 2 of 8
Code of Business Conduct                                         Eff. 04/01/2011

<PAGE>

          whereby the Covered Officer, or a member of his or her family, would
          benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

     -    not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,
          for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer, or a
          member of his or her family, rather than the benefit of the Fund;

     -    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
          or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to
          trade personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
          transactions; and

     -    report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate) known
          affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of
          interest with respect to the Fund.

     If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict of
     interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or
     his or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered
     Officer, including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his
     or her responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary
     Service Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code
     Officer, the CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent
     Directors, as appropriate.

     Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially compromise
     objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and which
     the Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or
     other appropriate person include:

     -    service as a director on the board of a public or private company or
          service as a public official;

     -    the receipt of a non-de minimus gift when the gift is in relation to
          doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

     -    the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
          current or prospective business dealings, unless such entertainment is
          business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
          place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     -    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the
          Primary Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
          transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
          portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than
          an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

4.   DISCLOSURE  AND  COMPLIANCE

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

     -    to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
          generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and
          financial operations of the Fund;

     -    to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others to
          misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board, legal counsel, legal
          counsel to the Independent Directors and auditors, and to governmental
          regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

<PAGE>

     -    to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the Primary
          Service Providers with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
          timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
          communications made by the Fund; and

     -    to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility, promote
          compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

5.   REPORTING  AND  ACCOUNTABILITY  BY  COVERED  OFFICERS

     Each  Covered  Officer  must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer, acknowledge
          in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has received, read and
          understands the Code, using the form attached as APPENDIX I hereto;

     -    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any violation,
          or of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be or result in a
          violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a violation of this Code.

     The Fund will follow the policy set forth below in investigating and
     enforcing this Code:

     -    The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
          investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

     -    If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the person(s)
          reporting the potential violation, and no further action is required;

     -    Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
          believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or the
          CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers,
          as appropriate; and

     -    This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
          extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly
     any violations of, or material issues arising under, this Code.

6.   OTHER  POLICIES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for the
     purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002and the rules and
     forms applicable to registered management investment companies thereunder.
     Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Fund or the Fund's Primary
     Service Providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of
     the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by
     this Code to the extent that they conflict with the provisions of this
     Code. The Fund's and its Adviser's and, if any, principal underwriter's
     codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the more detailed
     policies and procedures of the Primary Service Providers as

        CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

I,  Scott  J.  Lederman,  certify  that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Grosvenor Registered
     Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1), LLC;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
     of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material

     a statement of cash flows) of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The Registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the Registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          Registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The Registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     Registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
