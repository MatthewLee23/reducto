                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose outstanding
voting securities are held by the Company are defined as "Affiliated Companies"
in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and options
is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and distributions
to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at June 30, 2004 was $1,018,246,195 and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $296,174,606, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $428,062,720 and $131,888,114,
respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee, and recommendations
to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $93,347,907 and
$78,599,807, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2004 can be
found on page 11.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2004 were as follows:

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On June 30, 2004, the Company held a total of 824,650 shares of its Common Stock
at a cost of $10,351,626. The Company held 346,850 shares of its Common Stock at
a cost of $4,287,238 on December 31, 2003.

The Company has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation rights
plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation rights
for the purchase of up to 2,610,146 shares of the Company's Common Stock at 100%
of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are exercisable beginning not
less than one year after the date of grant and extend and vest over ten years
from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are exercisable beginning not
less than two years after the date of grant and extend over the period during
which the option is exercisable. The stock appreciation rights allow the holders
to surrender their rights to exercise their options and receive cash or shares
in an amount equal to the difference between the option price and the fair
market value of the Common Stock at the date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation
rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by the Company
during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2004, 229,364 options were
outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $12.07 per share. During
the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Company granted options including stock
appreciation rights for 62,067 shares of Common Stock at an original weighted
average exercise price of $12.57. At June 30, 2004, there were outstanding
exercisable options to purchase 127,417 common shares at $3.79-$18.41 per share
(weighted average price of $12.43), and unexercisable options to purchase
164,014 common shares at $5.38-$18.41 per share (weighted average price of
$11.95). The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding
exercisable and unexercisable options is 6.18 years and 7.32 years,
respectively. Total compensation expense recognized for the six months ended
June 30, 2004 related to the stock options and stock appreciation rights plan
was $58,994. At June 30, 2004, there were 1,180,685 shares available for future
option grants.

5. Retirement Plans

The Company's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers all
full-time employees with at least one year of service. Benefits are based on
length of service and compensation during the last five years of employment. The
Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plan those amounts that can be
deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the Company
deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be
paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, no
contributions to the plan have been made. The Company presently does not
anticipate making any contributions to the plan in 2004.

In addition, the Company has a nonqualified defined benefit plan which provides
eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic pension
cost for the six months ended June 30:

7. Portfolio Securities Loaned

Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of approximately 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that
may occur during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Company. At
June 30, 2004, the Company had securities on loan of $69,157,669 and held
collateral of $70,493,153, consisting of repurchase agreements, time deposits
and commercial paper.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at June 30, 2004, and the results of
its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for
each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at June 30, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election
card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
election by notifying their brokerage house representative.
