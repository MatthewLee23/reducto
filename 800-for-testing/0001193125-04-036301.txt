Item 1.  Reports to Stockholders.

                                                               February 1, 2004

Dear Shareholder:

   When we think about 2003, we'll remember a year in which financial services
underwent significant change. National news events reflected regulatory concern
regarding the business conduct of a few mutual fund companies. As a result,
certain industry-wide practices came under increased scrutiny. Your fund's
Board of Trustees recognizes the seriousness of these issues. As a result, it
has expanded its review of policies and procedures to insure compliance with
applicable rules and regulations. Additionally, the Board has undertaken a
review of its own structure and governance protocols to insure that our
practices are not only compliant with regulatory standards, but, whenever
practical, also conform to best practices that value your interests and help
you invest wisely.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund announced new management effective April 1,
2003. Carlton Neel and David Dickerson have managed the Fund since that time in
conjunction with the asset allocation strategies provided by Dr. Martin Zweig
and his advisory firm Zweig Consulting LLC. Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson
currently manage several other funds in the Phoenix open-end mutual fund
complex, including the Phoenix-Market Neutral fund, and several small-cap value
portfolios. The Fund's investment objectives have remained the same under the
new management.

   I hope that you'll take time to review the activities and performance
information included in this Zweig Total Return Fund Annual Report.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 3.18% for the three
months ended December 31, 2003, including the $0.067 in reinvested
distributions. Consistent with our policy of seeking to minimize risks, while
earning reasonable returns, the Fund's average overall exposure during the
quarter was approximately 80%.

   For the year ended December 3l, 2003 the Fund's net asset value gained
7.08%, including the $0.477 in reinvested distributions. During the same
period, the S&P 500 Index increased 28.71% and the Lehman Brothers Government
Bond Index increased 2.35%. Our average overall exposure to the bond and equity
markets for the year was approximately 68%.

   The Fund recently announced a distribution of $0.010 payable on January 12,
2004, to holders of record on December 3l, 2003. Including this distribution,
the Fund's total payout since its inception is now $12.523.

              Sincerely,

              /s/ Philip R. McLoughlin
              Philip R. McLoughlin
              Chairman

                                 MARKET OUTLOOK

   Our bond exposure at year-end was 62% with average duration (a measure of
sensitivity to interest rates) of 2.8 years. On September 30 our bond exposure
was 34% with average duration of 2.9 years. If we were fully invested, we would
be at 62.5% in bonds and 37.5% in stocks. Consequently, at 62% we are at 99% of
a full investment (62 divided by 62.5%).

   The resurgent economy and strong stock market drove investors away from
Treasury securities and pushed interest rates generally higher during the year.
The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note began the year at 3.82% and
rose to 4.5% by year-end. Despite the advance in yields, the coupon yield of
roughly 4% on the Treasury note was sufficient to eke out a slight gain for the
year.

   Treasury prices rallied in the first and second quarters as yields fell to a
45-year low of

<PAGE>

3.1% in early June. Much of the year's first-half rally was fueled by the
Federal Reserve's pledge to fight deflationary forces in the economy, including
possible buy-backs of longer maturity bonds. For the first half of the year
10-year notes returned 4.6%.

   Bonds did not react well to the Fed's cut of 25 basis points on June 23 that
took the overnight rate to 1.00%. Many investors were hoping for, or even
counting on, a half-point cut. Their fears that the prospect for lower interest
rates had come to the end of the road were confirmed by much stronger economic
data in July and August. The 10-year note lost 7.08% in July, the worst monthly
return for Treasuries in over twenty years. August saw a rebound with more than
half of the losses erased. Generally speaking, the third quarter was one of the
most volatile and difficult quarters the bond market has ever experienced. By
September 30 the 10-year note had lost 1.87% and the yield had risen to 3.93%.

   Things settled down for the bond market in the fourth quarter and the
10-year note traded in a range between 4% and 4.5%. Most analysts believe the
Fed will tighten monetary policy this year and increase its overnight rate from
1.00%. Consequently, most investors are cautious on the bond outlook for 2004.

   We held a high duration and committed to bonds for most of the first half of
2003 and trimmed our exposure in a timely way at mid-year. While we generally
share the prevailing cautious outlook for the bond market, we are perhaps a bit
more sanguine for the near term. We believe it is unlikely that the Fed will
raise rates before the November elections. As always, we will remain flexible
and stick to the dictates of our research.

   Our exposure in U.S. common stocks at the year-end was 23% against 19% on
September 30, 2003. At 23% we are at about 61% of a full position (23% divided
by 37.5%).

   After slipping for three consecutive years, the stock market surged in 2003.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 25.3%, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
climbed 28.67%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index jumped 50%.

   Several factors were responsible for the market's strong performance. First,
there was the outcome of the Iraq war. When it started, many people worried
about its duration and sold stock. When the war went well, the market started
to bounce back from an oversold position. Secondly, investors awoke to the fact
that the economy was actually improving and that earnings were coming in nicely.

   I believe the rally in the last three or four months of the year was spurred
by economic news exceeding even the most bullish expectations. The Gross
Domestic Product soared 8.2% in the third quarter and the fourth quarter
appeared quite strong. Also, earnings were extremely good, rising 11.6% for the
third quarter, the biggest quarterly increase since 1992.

   Traditionally, the market does not do well when the GDP is extraordinarily
high or when earnings are really great. That's usually when inflation begins to
pick up and the Federal Reserve starts to tighten. But that hasn't happened
this time. Instead, the Fed held its interest rate at one percent despite the
rising economy. With interest rates low and the economy advancing, all the
speculative money went into the stock market.

   When the Fed held interest rates steady at its December meeting, it
reiterated that its cheap money policy could be maintained for "a considerable
period." It also said that the risk of a fall in inflation was almost equal to
a rise. In addition, the Fed saw equal upside and downside risks for achieving
sustainable economic growth over the next few quarters.

   I think that the Fed is right about the diverse pressures on prices but
that's about the only thing I agree with. There are some deflationary

                                      2

<PAGE>


threats in the world, especially from the constant lowering of prices on
imported goods stemming from low foreign labor costs. However commodity prices
around the world have leaped. China, whose economy is booming, is possibly the
biggest buyer of oil, copper, and a host of other commodities. This translates
into some inflationary pressures.

   Right now I think we are heading into bubble number two. It's not like
bubble number one but the market is extremely overvalued and there's an awful
lot of optimism, as measured by my sentiment model. I believe many people
rationalize the high price/earnings ratios because short term interest rates
are so low. Rates have nowhere to go on the downside but in my opinion, there's
plenty of room on the upside and we are getting inflationary pressures. Should
rates rise, it will be impossible to justify the current price to earnings
ratios. However if earnings continue to be strong, then who knows? Maybe the
market can continue to rise.

   The stock market was much less volatile last year. There were only 15 days
in which the Dow gained or declined 2% compared with 48 in 2002, 25 in 2001,
and 31 in 2000. Ironically, the market historically does best coming off a
period of very high volatility. Although this indicator doesn't work all the
time, the lack of volatility frequently is a sign of complacency.

   Meanwhile, money is pouring into stock mutual funds. The public invested
more than $150 billion in the funds since the market began to rally last March,
the fastest inflow since the market peak in 2000. November's inflow of $15
billion was the eighth consecutive month of positive inflows. Despite three
years of losses, mutual fund assets are up 13% since the end of 2002. So far
inflows have helped the market but at some point they will be overdone. If this
is a bubble, it is very possible that the high inflows could continue for a
year or two or even longer. The last bubble began in 1996 and didn't end until
2000.

   There is nothing wrong with the stock market rising but, at these
valuations, I just don't know. Because these valuations are totally out of
whack with previous market bottoms, I still don't believe the bottoms we have
seen will be the final market bottom. Last year the price/earnings ratio of the
S&P 500 fell to about 27 from 32. However this is still substantially above the
historical average of 16. Meanwhile the NASDAQ 100 is selling at 40 times
estimated 2004 earnings. Incidentally, I still believe that many earnings are
overstated. I believe we still have many of the accounting problems and, for
the most part, there is no recognition of the expense of stock options.

   One of the reasons I don't think the major trend bear market is over is the
low level of cash at mutual funds. In November, the last month for which
figures are available, the average stock mutual fund had only 4.6% of its
assets in cash.* Normally at a stock market bottom you would see something like
9% or 10% in cash. I believe one reason for the present figure is that index
funds are not holding any cash. I believe another reason is that many portfolio
managers are afraid to carry cash because they think the real risk is lagging
the market and not of the market crashing while they are 100% invested. Until I
see higher levels of cash, I will remain skeptical.

   As analysts are getting more bullish, insiders are selling more stock.
During November insiders sold $43 in stock for every dollar's worth they
bought. It was the seventh consecutive month in which the sell-buy ratio topped
twenty to one.* We have tested the insider numbers extensively. Because some
insider sales involve the exercise of options, we just look at the amount
they're buying. We have found that their purchases, relative to market
capitalization, are very, very low. It doesn't mean that insiders are always
right -- they sometimes are not -- but it is one of the negative signs for the
market in my sentiment model.

   Another negative in the model is margin debt. Although it is down roughly
half from its

                                      3

<PAGE>


2000 peak, it hasn't dropped nearly enough relative to what has occurred
historically after major bear markets. It does not mean that the market can't
go higher but I would not be wild about any further increases in margin debt.
Short-selling indicators, on the other hand, are decent. The short interest
ratio, which is the short position divided by the average daily volume, isn't
bad, especially on NASDAQ. It is one of my few sentiment indicators that is
okay, in my opinion.

   One market positive last year was the tax bill that lowered the tax on
dividends. That has helped the market. Companies in the S&P 500 are estimated
to have paid a record of $160.6 billion to shareholders in 2003, up from $147.8
billion in 2002. More companies are initiating disbursements and others are
increasing theirs. Unfortunately, dividend yields are very low. The S&P yield
now is 1.6% and the Dow is 2%. Although yields look good relative to short-term
rates, I think they don't offer much protection on the downside.

   In a market where the dividend yield is, say, 6%, which we get at major
market bottoms, investors have real protection if the market declines. Many
investors seeking value would come into the market. Should the market dip
moderately or mark time, the 6% figure would look good. If short-term interest
rates rise, the current dividend yields would not look nearly as attractive as
they are today.

   Although consumer confidence has climbed quite a bit from its lows, with the
Conference Board reporting a 91.3 figure for December, I see danger on the
horizon. The Fed reported that total consumer debt hit a record of $1.98
trillion in October. Since consumer spending accounts for about 75% of the GDP,
the extremely high debt presents a troubling question: Where will the juice
come to keep this economy going? Consumers have carried the economy but I don't
know how they can keep increasing their debt at a fast enough rate. The problem
might ease if more people get jobs or real income rises but with all the
foreign competition, I believe that will be difficult.

   Even more troublesome is the growing federal deficit that some analysts say
could hit $500 billion this year. As the late Senator Everett Dirksen once
said, you take a billion here and a billion there, and pretty soon it adds up
to real money. This number is staggering. I can't even comprehend $500 billion
in deficits. I believe it's fine to run a deficit to stimulate the economy
during a recession, but when the economy is growing the deficit should be
narrowing. If it keeps widening, at some point it would put upward pressure on
interest rates that could hurt the economy.

   Indicating a strong economy, the Institute for Supply Management's index of
manufacturing activity surged to 66.2 in December from 62.8 in November and was
the highest in twenty years. But, historically, this figure has a downside.
When it has been in the bottom 20% of all readings, anything below 47, the
market has gone up at a 16.9% annual rate. In the top 20% of all readings, any
number above 59, the market has gone up only three-tenths of a percent.

   That's because the stock market is a forward looking, discounting mechanism.
So when the economy is limp and the ISM index is weak, I think it is usually a
good time to buy stocks. Turn back the clock a year or so, and that's the
period we were going through. Now with the economy booming, we've had several
great quarters in a row and the ISM index is off the charts. Historically, when
we get these kinds of readings, the Fed would be tightening. If the Fed
continues to sit on its hands, it is possible that the stock market momentum
will continue and we will get further into bubble number two.

   These are very unusual times. We have a political situation the likes of
which we have never seen. If there is a major terrorist attack on our country,
the whole stock market could fall apart. We are running a budget deficit, which
is okay in a recession, but we are not in a recession anymore. A lot of the
spending is mandated for homeland security and we have to support our

                                      4

<PAGE>


troops overseas. But if we don't narrow our deficit, it is likely the dollar
will get weaker. It is already down 20% against the euro and 10% against the
Japanese yen.

   Worse to me than the budget deficit is the massive trade deficit. Some
believe that the weak dollar is great for our economy because it helps our
exports. But if we buy more expensive Japanese television sets or German cars
or Italian shoes, or other foreign products are we really better off
economically? What's more, if the weak dollar causes foreigners to sell their
U.S. assets it could put upward pressure on bond yields and downward pressure
on stocks. If we don't do something to strengthen the dollar we could wind up
with a real economic headache.

   Summing up, in my opinion the positives include the tape action with its
very favorable ratio of advances versus declines. The strong earnings are also
a positive, although they have a negative potential. As long as earnings are
good, people feel confident about the market. The problem is that the expanding
economy usually leads to higher interest rates. We haven't seen them yet. So
another positive for the time being is the Fed keeping its gas pedal to the
metal but eventually that will create difficulties down the road.

   On the negative side are my sentiment indicators that are terrible on
balance, the horrible valuations and the weak dollar. So far the weak dollar
has helped to stimulate the economy but, if it slides further, it could be
nasty.

   If nothing disastrous happens to the world and the Fed keeps cheap money, I
could see the market going up 20% to 30% but it would be kind of a bubble
period. If bad things occur in the world, I could see the market dropping 20%
to 30%.

   Because of the risks involved on all sides, I am currently on the fence. We
are about 57% invested in U.S. common stocks. Could I go to 60%? Yes, but I
don't want to increase too much because of the downside risk. My mandate is to
mitigate risk. If we are lagging the market a bit, fine. But, if there's a
sharp downturn, I would kick myself for being heavily invested because I know
about all the previously mentioned important negatives.

   If everything stays comfortably stable for the next three or six months,
this market could go a lot higher. However it just doesn't have a good feel to
me because I still don't think we have touched the final bottom yet. The
current situation reminds me of when the Japanese market peaked at the end of
1989. For the next thirteen years or so they had a long-term bear market.

   Within that span they had three or four really big upward moves that were
small bull markets. Of course a small bull market could be up 50% and that's
what we have already seen in the NASDAQ. While NASDAQ is nowhere near its high,
some averages have actually made new highs. However the whole picture just
doesn't make me feel comfortable and I don't want to roll the dice with other
people's money. I am not straddling the fence because I think the market will
go sideways. I believe it could be volatile on the upside or the downside.

              Sincerely,
              /s/ Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               December 31, 2003

NOTE 1 -- Organization

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's objective is to seek the highest total
return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- Significant Accounting Policies

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  A. Portfolio Valuation

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price. Debt securities are valued
on the basis of broker quotations or valuations provided by a pricing service
which, in determining value, utilizes information with respect to recent sales,
market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from dealers and
various relationships between securities. Short-term investments having a
remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost which
approximates market value. Securities for which market quotations are not
readily available, (of which there were none at December 31, 2003) and other
assets, if any, are valued at fair value as determined under procedures
approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

  B. Security Transactions and Investment Income

   Security transactions are recorded on trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. Discount and premium on securities purchased other than short-term
securities are accreted on the constant yield method over the life of the
respective securities.

   Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the
identified cost basis for financial reporting and tax purposes.

                                      15

<PAGE>



  C. Federal Income Tax Information

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code ("the Code"), applicable to regulated investment companies, and to
distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders. In addition, the Fund
intends to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid the imposition of any
excise tax under Section 4982 of the Code. Therefore, no provision for federal
income taxes or excise taxes has been made.

  D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

   Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income
and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with tax
regulations that may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences include the treatment of premium amortization, losses
deferred due to wash sales, differing treatment of certain income and gain
transactions, and the timing of distributions. For financial reporting
purposes, book basis capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the tax character
of permanent book/tax differences. The reclassifications have no impact on the
net assets or net asset value of the Fund. As of December 31, 2003, the Fund
decreased undistributed net investment income by $1,327,562, increased
accumulated net realized loss by $4,574,891 and increased paid in capital by
$5,902,453.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the schedule of
Investments and Securities Sold Short) consist of undistributed ordinary income
of $0 and undistributed long-term capital gains of $0. The Fund has $51,333,052
of capital loss carryovers, $46,558,126 expiring in 2010 and $4,774,926
expiring in 2011 which may be used to offset future capital gains. The Fund may
not realize the benefits of these losses to the extent it does not realize
gains on investments prior to the expiration of the capital loss carryovers. In
addition, under certain conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of these
losses to the extent that distributions to shareholders exceed required
distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders
may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.

  E. Foreign currency translation

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not separate that portion of the results of operations arising from
changes in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market
prices of the securities.

  F. Forward currency contracts

   The Fund may enter into forward currency contracts in conjunction with the
planned purchase or sale of foreign denominated securities in order to hedge
the U.S. dollar cost or proceeds. Forward currency contracts involve, to
varying degrees, elements of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Risks arise from the possible
movements in foreign exchange rates or if the counterparty does not perform
under the contract.

                                      16

<PAGE>



   A forward currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a
specific currency at a future date, which may be any number of days from the
date of the contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of
the contract. These contracts are traded directly between currency traders and
their customers. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the change in
market value is recorded by each Fund as an unrealized gain or loss. When the
contract is closed or offset with the same counterparty, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the change in the value of the contract when it
was opened and the value at the time it was closed or offset.

  G. Options

   The Fund may write covered options or purchase options contracts for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the market value of the underlying
securities of foreign currencies.

   The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or closing of the
option transaction. Gains and losses on written options are reported separately
in the Statement of Operations. When a written option is exercised, the
proceeds on sales or amounts paid are adjusted by the amount of premium
received. Options written are reported as a liability in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current
value of the option. The risk associated with written options is that the
change in value of options contracts may not correspond to the change in the
value of the hedged instruments.

   The Fund may purchase options which are included in the Fund's schedule of
Investments and securities sold short and subsequently marked-to-market to
reflect the current value of the option. When a purchased option is exercised,
the cost of the security is adjusted by the amount of the premium paid.

  H. Short Sales

   A short sale is a transaction in which the Fund sells a security it does not
own in anticipation of a decline in market price. To sell a security short, the
Fund must borrow the security. The Fund's obligation to replace the security
borrowed and sold short will be fully collateralized at all times by the
proceeds from the short sale retained by the broker and by cash and securities
deposited in a segregated account with the Fund's custodian. If the price of
the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the
time the Fund replaces the borrowed security, the Fund will realize a loss, and
if the price declines during the period, the Fund will realize a gain. Any
realized gain will be decreased by, and any realized loss increased by, the
amount of transaction costs. Dividends on short sales are recorded as an
expense to the Fund on ex-dividend date. At December 31, 2003, the value of
securities sold short amounted to $14,078,390 against which collateral of
$16,259,910 was held. The collateral includes the deposits with broker for
securities held short and the value of the segregated investments held long, as
shown in the schedule of Investments and Securities Sold Short. Short selling
used in the management of the Fund may accelerate the velocity of potential
losses if the prices of securities sold short appreciate quickly. Stocks
purchased may decline in value at the same time stocks sold short appreciate in
value, thereby increasing potential losses.

 **Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
***Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
   the opening of the first business day and a sale on the closing of the last
   business day of each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any,
   are assumed for the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices
   obtained under the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan.
   Generally, total investment return based on net asset value will be higher
   than total investment return based on market value in periods where there is
   an increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value
   to the net assets from the beginning to the end of such years. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease

                        Report of Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.:

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments and securities sold short, and the
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") at December 31, 2003, the result
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

     (a)  The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
          has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
          principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
          accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
          functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the
          registrant or a third party.

     (b)  There have been no amendments, during the period covered by this
          report, to a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the
          registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
          principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing
          similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals are
          employed by the registrant or a third party, and that relates to any
          element of the code of ethics description.

     (c)  The registrant has not granted any waivers during the period covered
          by this report, including an implicit waiver, from a provision of the
          code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal executive
          officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
          controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of
          whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or a third
          party, that relates to one or more of the items set forth in paragraph
          (b) of this item's instructions.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The registrant does not have an audit committee financial expert at this time
because none of the registrant's board of directors meets the technical
definition of such an expert in form N-CSR. The audit committee of the board is
in compliance with I) applicable rules of the listing requirements for
closed-end fund audit committees, including the requirement that all members of
the audit committee be "financially literate" and that at least one member of
the audit committee have "accounting or related financial management expertise",
as determined by the board."

Item 4.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

     Audit Fees
     ----------
     (a)  The aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for
          professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the
          audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or services that
          are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory
          and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years are
          $55,500 and $58,000.

     Audit-Related Fees
     ------------------

<PAGE>

     (b)  The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
          assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are
          reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the registrant's
          financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this
          Item are $0 and $1,000.

     These services are for a review of the semi annual report.

     Tax Fees
     --------

(c)  The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance,
tax advice, and tax planning are $7,000 and $5,700. "Tax Fees" are those
primarily associated with review of year-end distributions by the Fund to avoid
excise tax for the Trust, periodic discussion with management on tax issues
affecting the Trust, and reviewing and signing the Fund's federal income and
excise tax returns.

     All Other Fees
     --------------

     (d)  The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
          products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than
          the services reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item are
          $0.

     (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
            described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") Board has adopted policies and
procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services provided by PwC. The
Audit Committee pre-approves: (i) all audit and no-audit services to be rendered
to the Fund by PwC; and (ii) all non-audit services to be rendered to the Fund
financial reporting of the Fund provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate
thereof that provides ongoing services to the Fund (collectively, "Covered
Services"). The Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing
a member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of
the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which are not
otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit committee, provided that such
delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The
pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit committee's
responsibilities to management. Pre-approval has not been waived with respect to
any of the services described above since the date on which the Audit Committee
adopted its current pre-approval procedures.

     (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
            through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
            pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
            are as follows:

                 (b) 100%

                 (c) 100%

                 (d) Not applicable

     (f)  The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were attributed to work

<PAGE>

          performed by persons other than the principal accountant's full-time,
          permanent employees was less than fifty percent.

     (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
          services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
          investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
          primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen
          by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
          by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing
          services to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of
          the registrant was $46,250 and $248,000 respectively.

     (h)  The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
          considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
          rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
          sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
          subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
          entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
          investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
          that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
          2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
          accountant's independence.

I.   Definitions. As used in this Statement of Policy, the following terms shall
     have the meanings ascribed below:

     A.   "Adviser" refers to Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC.

<PAGE>

     B.   "Corporate Governance Matters" refers to changes involving the
          corporate ownership or structure of an issuer whose securities are

          incorporation, changes in capital structure, including increases and
          decreases of capital and preferred stock issuance, mergers and other
          corporate restructurings, and anti-takeover provisions such as
          staggered boards, poison pills, and supermajority voting provisions.

     C.   "Delegate" refers to the Adviser or Subadviser to whom responsibility
          has been delegated to vote proxies for the applicable Portfolio
          Holding, including any qualified, independent organization engaged by
          the Adviser to vote proxies on behalf of such delegated entity.

     D.   "Fund" shall individually and collectively mean and refer to The Zweig
          Total Return Fund, Inc. and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., and
          each of them.

     E.   "Management Matters" refers to stock option plans and other management
          compensation issues.

     F.   "Portfolio Holding" refers to any company or entity whose securities
          is held within the investment portfolio(s) of one or more of the Fund
          as of the date a proxy is solicited.

     G.   "Proxy Contests" refer to any meeting of shareholders of an issuer for

          one solicited by management and the others by a dissident or group of

     I.   "Takeover" refers to "hostile" or "friendly" efforts to effect radical
          change in the voting control of the board of directors of a company.

II.  General Policy. It is the intention of the Fund to exercise stock ownership
     rights in Portfolio Holdings in a manner that is reasonably anticipated to
     further the best economic interests of shareholders of the Fund.
     Accordingly, the Fund or its Delegate(s) shall endeavor to analyze and vote
     all proxies that are considered likely to have financial implications, and,
     where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
     proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and
     its Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts

<PAGE>

     of interests in voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in
     accordance with this Statement of Policy.

III. Factors to consider when voting.

A.   A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect on
     shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio Holding is
     indeterminable or insignificant.

     B.   In analyzing anti-takeover measures, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
          long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
          industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
          without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
          operating income, net income, and total shareholder returns (share
          price appreciation plus dividends). Other financial indicators that
          will be considered include margin analysis, cash flow, and debit
          levels.

     C.   In analyzing contested elections, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
          qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
          consider the independence and attendance record of board and key
          committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile shall
          be completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
          accountability.

     D.   In analyzing corporate governance matters, the Delegate shall vote on
          a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
          economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
          incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
          changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
          supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
          bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

     E.   In analyzing executive compensation proposals and management matters,
          the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into
          consideration such factors as executive pay and spending on
          perquisites, particularly in conjunction with sub-par performance and
          employee layoffs.

     F.   In analyzing proxy contests for control, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
          financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
          management's track record; background to the proxy

<PAGE>

          contest; qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation
          of what each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood
          that the proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
          positions.

     G.   A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder social matters
          proposals.

IV.  Delegation.

     A.   In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board
          of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting
          proxies for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement
          of Policy, or for delegating such responsibility as described below.

     B.   The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
          Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the
          best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall
          accept direction or inappropriate influence from any other client,
          director or employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any
          vote inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the
          prior approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

     C.   With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
          Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
          satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
          Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
          pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
          Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
          thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
          Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
          with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
          however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its
          own proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
          following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
          approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
          determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed
          to further the best economic interests of the affected Fund
          shareholders, and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and
          approved annually by the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will
          promptly notify the Adviser of any material changes to the Subadviser
          Procedures. The Adviser will periodically review the votes by the
          Subadviser for consistency with this Statement of Policy.

V.   Conflicts of Interest

     A.   The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
          conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings
          between the interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of
          the Adviser, Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          of the Fund, on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into
          account a wide array of factors in determining whether such a conflict
          exists, whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to
          properly address or resolve the same.

     B.   While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
          presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
          or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
          otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
          conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote)
          proxies pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the
          recommendations of an established, independent third party with
          qualifications to vote proxies such as Institutional Shareholder
          Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing
          Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or (iv) where two or more Delegates
          provide conflicting requests, vote shares in proportion to the assets
          under management of the each proposing Delegate.

     C.   The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
          actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
          recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
          shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
          any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
          of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
          Article.

     D.   In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
          Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
          scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
          shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
          apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
          determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

VI.  Miscellaneous.

A.   A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting and
     the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio Holdings
     and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and justification, shall be
     kept in an easily accessible place and available upon request.

<PAGE>

B.   The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from this
     Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of
     Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of Trustees may
     request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to the Fund or any
     shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy voting pursuant to this
     Statement of Policy at such times and in such format or medium as the Fund
     shall reasonably request. The Adviser shall be solely responsible for
     complying with the disclosure and reporting requirements under applicable
     laws and regulations, including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under
     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and
     present information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
     each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine from
     time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure and
     reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended.

C.   The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for Portfolio
     Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting the Fund in
     providing public notice of the manner in which such proxies were voted.

     D.   The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
          committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case
          may be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any duly
          authorized committee, may engage the services of a research and/or
          voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by such
          entity.

     E.   This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees
          annually for their amendment and/or approval.

<DESCRIPTION>THE CODE OF ETHICS
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

                                                                  EX-99.CODE ETH

The "Code"
- ----------

The Code of Ethics applies to the principal executive, financial and accounting
officers of The Phoenix Companies, Inc. ("PNX"). It constitutes the main part of
the Phoenix Code of Conduct, which has applied to all employees of PNX and its
subsidiaries for many years. We plan to continue to revise both codes from time
to time as needed to keep them viable, relevant and in compliance with all
applicable legislative and regulatory requirements.

Commitment to Shareholders
- --------------------------

Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.

Conflicts of Interest

Phoenix expects every employee, officer and director to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the corporation as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee, officer or director takes actions or has interests that may make it
difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and
effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee, officer or
director, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his or her position in the Company.

Employees requested to serve on the Board of Directors of another company by
Phoenix owe a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose Board
of Directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between the
interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested to serve
on the Board of Directors of another company shall accept fees or other
compensation for Board service. In the event the company for which an employee
serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any remuneration
received by the employee shall be donated to a charitable organization. The
Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the employee.

<PAGE>

All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees, officers and directors are required to file a Conflict of
Interest Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following
completion of the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to
the Chief Compliance Officer in writing.

Corporate Opportunities

Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its
legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently,
employees, officers and directors are prohibited from engaging in the following
activities:

..    Taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
     the use of corporate property, information or position;

..    Using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and

..    Competing with the Company.

Insider Trading and Personal Trading

Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee, officer or director may buy
or sell Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information.
This restriction also applies to an employee's spouse, other adults living in
the employee's household, and minor children. Employees and their family members
also must avoid passing non-public information on to third parties.

<PAGE>

Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of the
company to which the information relates.

Officers are subject to certain restrictions under New York Insurance Law
governing ownership of Phoenix stock. Officers and their family members are
prohibited from purchasing shares of Phoenix stock for a period of two years
from the date of demutualization.

All employees with a title of Vice President or higher, plus certain other
employees whose positions place them in regular contact with non-public
information, are subject to a further restriction as well. These employees may
only buy or sell Phoenix securities during "window" periods.

No employee, officer or director may buy or sell securities of another company
with the knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or
sale by Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any advisory accounts. In the case
of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the outstanding
equity, no employee (or family member) may make any personal investment without
prior approval from the Law Department.

Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure preclearance of and/or report
all personal securities transactions. In addition, Phoenix reserves the right to
require duplicate confirmations, quarterly transaction reports and prior
clearance for any personal securities transactions. If you have any question
whether your position requires preclearance or reporting, you should contact the
compliance officer for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer)
or the Corporate Compliance Department.

Confidentiality

Employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
to them by the Company or its customers. Disclosure of confidential information
is restricted to authorized persons or in situations in which disclosure is
legally mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information
that may or may not be of use to competitors, or harmful to

<PAGE>

the Company or its customers if disclosed, including, but not limited to:
internal operating procedures; investment strategies; sales data and customer
lists; financial plans; projections; and reports. An employee's obligation to
protect confidential information continues even after termination of his or her
employment.

Protection and Use of Company Property and Assets

Employees are given access to Company property to assist them in effectively
carrying out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used
for legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property and
ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a direct
impact on the Company's profitability.

Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.

Corporate Disclosures

As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about The Phoenix Companies, Inc. It is imperative that
such information is disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with
SEC disclosure requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that
information released is accurate and properly disseminated, only certain
individuals are authorized to speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are
prohibited from speaking with rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press
without obtaining prior authorization from the President and Chief Executive
Officer. Employees receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to
the appropriate area for response:

..    Press and News Media - All inquiries must be referred to the Senior Vice
     President, Corporate Communications.

<PAGE>

..    Rating Agencies - All inquiries must be referred to the Chief Financial
     Officer.

..    Securities Analysts and Investors - All inquiries must be referred to the
     Vice President, Investor Relations or the Chief Financial Officer.

Employees are prohibited from disclosing any non-public information about the
Company's financial performance or commenting on the Company's stock
performance.

Accuracy and Retention of Company Records

The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The altering, falsification or misuse of Company documents is strictly
prohibited.

Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately recorded on the Company's
books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
any other required accounting basis and established Company policy. Financial
information must fairly represent all relevant information.

The retention and destruction of Company records shall be in accordance with
established Company policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Commitment to Clients
- ---------------------

Phoenix upholds its commitment to our clients by conducting our business fairly
and honestly, and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all dealings with
customers.

Safeguarding Customer Assets

<PAGE>

Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees must
not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other assets, or
assist another individual in doing so.

Ethical Market Conduct

The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:

..    Conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;

..    Provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;

..    Engage in active and fair competition;

..    Provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;

..    Handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
     manner; and

..    Monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with ethical
     market conduct.

Privacy and Confidential Personal Information

<PAGE>

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans and health.
