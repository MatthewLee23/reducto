LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[PHOTO]

R. Jay Gerken
R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to provide you with the first shareholder report for the Salomon
Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc. This report details the fund's
performance for the period since its inception on July 29, 2003 through
November 30, 2003. Future shareholder reports will be sent to you every six
months to help keep you informed about market conditions and investment
strategies that have affected your fund's performance. Due to the fact that the
fund had been in operation for less than six months at the time of this report,
this letter, unlike future letters, will not contain information regarding the
fund's performance.

In addition, you can access the fund's closing market price in most newspapers
under the New York Stock Exchange listings; the fund is traded under the symbol
"EHI". The daily NAV is available online under symbol XEHIX. Barron's and The
Wall Street Journal's Monday editions carry closed-end fund tables that will
provide additional information. Furthermore, the fund issues a quarterly
allocation press release/1/ that can be found on most major financial web
sites, in addition to our website, www.sbam.com. Shareholders may call
1-888-735-6507, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time,
for the fund's current net asset value, market price and other information
regarding the fund's allocations.

This fund is advised by the managers at Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc,
which is relied upon by some of the world's largest institutions for global
fixed-income investment management services. Aside from its experience
investing in the U.S. high-yield and investment-grade bond markets, Salomon
Brothers Asset Management Inc was one of the first asset managers in the U.S.
to offer investors access to emerging markets debt securities over 13 years ago.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

Thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets. We look
forward to helping you pursue your long-term financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ R. Jay Gerken
R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman

December 23, 2003

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

/1/According to a recent press release, the fund's Board of Directors announced
   that it has authorized the fund to repurchase from time to time in the open
   market up to 3 million shares of the fund's common stock.

SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC .


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Salomon Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc. ("Fund") was incorporated in
Maryland and is registered as a non-diversified, closed-end, management
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Fund seeks to maintain a high level of current income by investing primarily in
a portfolio of high-yield fixed income securities issued by corporate issuers,
emerging market fixed income securities and investment grade fixed income
securities. As a secondary objective, the Fund seeks total return.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were a sale on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there were no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

(c) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Portfolio securities and other assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar
amounts at the date of valuation using the 12:00 noon rate of exchange

SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC .


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)

reported by Reuters. Purchases and sales of portfolio securities and income and
expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S.
dollars at rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses
realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amount actually received. The Fund does not isolate that portion of
gains and losses on investments which is due to changes in foreign exchange
rates from that which is due to changes in market prices of the securities.
Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or
loss from investments. However, pursuant to U.S. Federal income tax
regulations, certain net foreign exchange gains/losses included in realized
gain/loss are included in or are a reduction of ordinary income for Federal
income tax purposes.

(d) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated
investment companies, and to distribute all of its income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(e) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed at least annually.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets.

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy to take possession, through the custodian, of the underlying
collateral and to monitor its value at the time the arrangement is entered into
and during the term of the repurchase agreement to ensure that it equals or
exceeds the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligation to
repurchase, the Fund has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the
proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the
event of default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization
and/or retention of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

(g) CASH FLOW INFORMATION. The Fund invests in securities and distributes
dividends from net investment income and net realized gains which are paid in
cash and may be reinvested at the discretion of shareholders. These activities
are reported in the statement of changes in net assets and additional
information on cash receipts and cash payments is presented in the statement of
cash flows.

(h) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from GAAP.

                                                                        Page 17

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc ("SBAM"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager to the
Fund. SBAM is responsible on a day-to-day basis for the management of the
Fund's portfolio in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives and
policies and for making decisions to buy, sell or hold particular securities of
the Fund. The management fee for these services is payable monthly at an annual
rate of 0.85% of the Fund's average daily net assets plus the proceeds of any
outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

In connection with SBAM's service as investment manager to the Fund, Citigroup
Asset Management Ltd. ("CAM Ltd."), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Citigroup, will provide certain advisory services to SBAM relating to currency
transactions and investments in non-dollar-denominated debt securities for the
benefit of the Fund pursuant to a sub-advisory consulting agreement. SBAM will
pay CAM Ltd. a fee for its services at no additional expense to the Fund.

During periods in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the fee which
is payable to SBAM as a percentage of the Fund's assets will be higher than if
the Fund did not utilize leverage because the fee is calculated as a percentage
of the Fund's assets, including those investments purchased with leverage.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
directors of SBAM.

NOTE 3. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

During the period ended November 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

NOTE 4. FUTURES CONTRACTS

Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited with
the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contracts. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses by "marking to market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of
the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are
received or made and recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to
broker, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When
the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and
the Fund's basis in the contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically
to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises
from changes in the value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

At November 30, 2003, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

</TABLE>

NOTE 5. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements in which the Fund sells
portfolio securities and agrees to repurchase them from the buyer at a
particular date and price. Whenever the Fund enters into a reverse repurchase
agreement, the custodian delivers liquid assets in an amount at least equal to
the repurchase price marked-to-market daily (including accrued interest), and
subsequently monitors the account to ensure that such equivalent value is
maintained. The Fund pays interest on amounts obtained pursuant to reverse
repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be
borrowings by the Fund. Transactions in reverse repurchase agreements for the
Fund during the period ended November 30, 2003 were as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                       Average     Weighted      Maximum

The interest rate on reverse repurchase agreements was 0.90% during the period
ended November 30, 2003. Interest expense on reverse repurchase agreements
totaled $13,500.

                                                                        Page 19

                Brazil, DCB, Series L, 2.0625% due 4/15/12........ ===========
</TABLE>

NOTE 6. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund enters into dollar rolls in which the Fund sells mortgage-backed
securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts to
repurchase substantially similar (same type, coupon and maturity) securities to
settle on a specified future date. During the roll period, the Fund forgoes
principal and interest paid on the securities. The Fund is compensated by a fee
paid by the counterparty. Dollar rolls are accounted for as financing
arrangements; the fee is accrued into interest income ratably over the term of
the dollar roll and any gain or loss on the roll is deferred and realized upon
disposition of the rolled security. Dollar roll transactions involve the risk
that the market value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline below the
repurchase price of the similar securities.

At November 30, 2003, the Fund had outstanding net contracts to repurchase
mortgage-backed securities of $108,048,437 for a scheduled settlement of
December 11, 2003. The average monthly balance of dollar rolls outstanding
during the period ended November 30, 2003 was $89,242,145.

NOTE 7. SECURITIES TRADED ON A TO-BE-ANNOUNCED BASIS

The Fund trades securities on a to-be-announced ("TBA") basis, primarily in
connection with its dollar roll activity. In a TBA transaction, the Fund
commits to purchasing or selling securities which have not yet been issued by
the issuer. Securities purchased on a TBA basis are not settled until they are
delivered to the Fund, normally 15 to 45 days later. Beginning on the date the
Fund enters into a TBA transaction, securities are segregated in the amount of
the TBA transaction. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and
their current value is determined in the same manner as for other securities.

At November 30, 2003, the Fund held TBA securities with a total cost of
$106,853,438.

NOTE 8. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

Page 20

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC .


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)


In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower,
and the Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, the Fund will assume
the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the
participation. In the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the
participation, the Fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and
may not benefit from any set-off between the lender and the borrower.

At November 30, 2003, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$4,844,893.

NOTE 9. CREDIT RISK

The yields of emerging markets debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

NOTE 10. FOREIGN SECURITIES

Investing in securities of foreign companies and foreign governments involves
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in
U.S. companies and the U.S. government. These risks include revaluation of
currencies and future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover,
securities of many foreign companies and foreign governments and their markets
may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of securities of
comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.

NOTE 11. LOAN

At November 30, 2003, the Fund had outstanding a $100,000,000 loan pursuant to
a revolving credit and security agreement with Three Pillars Funding Corp. and
Citicorp North America Inc. ("CNA"), an affiliate of SBAM. In addition, CNA
acts as administrative agent. The loans generally bear interest at a variable
rate based on the weighted average interest rates of the underlying commercial
paper or LIBOR, plus any applicable margin. Securities held by the Fund are
subject to a lien, granted to the lenders, to the extent of the borrowing
outstanding and any additional expenses. For the period ended November 30,
2003, the Fund paid interest expense of $270,441.

                                                                        Page 21

NOTE 12. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30, 2003

On September 10, 2003, the Board of Directors ("Board") of the Fund declared
three dividends, each in the amount of $0.10625 per share, payable on December
26, 2003, January 30, 2004, and February 27, 2004 to shareholders of record on
December 16, 2003, January 13, 2004 and February 18, 2004, respectively.

In addition, on December 16, 2003, the Fund's Board announced an additional
ordinary income distribution of $0.11985 per share and a short-term capital
gain distribution of $0.06015 per share, payable on December 26, 2003 to
shareholders of record on December 22, 2003.

NOTE 13. CAPITAL SHARES

On October 22, 2003, the Fund's Board authorized the Fund to repurchase from
time to time in the open market up to 3,000,000 shares of the Fund's common
stock. The Board directed the management of the Fund to repurchase shares of
the Fund's common stock at such times and in such amounts as management
believes will enhance shareholder value, subject to review by the Fund's Board.
Since the inception of the repurchase plan, the Fund has not repurchased any
shares.

NOTE 14. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue
guarantee agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor
would guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue
Guarantee Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the
sub-contractor's business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent
(PFPC Inc.) used by CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee
Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)


CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
$16 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received from the
Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. The Fund did not implement the
contractual arrangement described above and therefore will not receive any
portion of the payment. CAM also plans an independent review to verify that the
transfer agency fees charged by CAM were fairly priced as compared to
competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new procedures and making changes
designed to ensure no similar arrangements are entered into in the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Unless you elect to receive distributions in cash, all dividends, including any
capital gain dividends, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested
by PFPC, as agent for the Common Shareholders (the "Plan Agent"), in additional
Common Shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). You may elect
not to participate in the Plan by contacting the Plan Agent. If you do not
participate, you will receive all cash distributions paid by check mailed
directly to you by PFPC as dividend paying agent.

If you participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will receive
will be determined as follows:

(1) If the market price of the Common Shares on the record date (or, if the
record date is not a New York Stock Exchange trading day, the immediately
preceding trading day) for determining shareholders eligible to receive the
relevant dividend or distribution (the "determination date") is equal to or
exceeds 98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares, the Fund
will issue new Common Shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) 98% of the
net asset value per share at the close of trading on the Exchange on the
determination date or (b) 95% of the market price per share of the Common
Shares on the determination date.

(2) If 98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares exceeds the
market price of the Common Shares on the determination date, the Plan Agent
will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will buy Common Shares in
the open market, on the Exchange or elsewhere, for your account as soon as
practicable commencing on the trading day following the determination date and
terminating no later than the earlier of (a) 30 days after the dividend or
distribution payment date, or (b) the record date for the next succeeding
dividend or distribution to be made to the Common Shareholders; except when
necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.
If during this period: (i) the market price rises so that it equals or exceeds
98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares at the close of
trading on the Exchange on the determination date before the Plan Agent has
completed the open market purchases or (ii) if the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full amount eligible to be reinvested in open market purchases, the
Plan Agent will cease purchasing Common Shares in the open market and the Fund
shall issue the remaining Common Shares at a price per share equal to the
greater of (a) 98% of the net asset value per share at the close of trading on
the Exchange on the determination date or (b) 95% of the then current market
price per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all participants' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all
Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

You may withdraw from the Plan by notifying the Plan Agent in writing at P.O.
Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8030 or by calling the Plan Agent at
1-800-331-1710. Such withdrawal will be effective immediately if notice is
received by the Plan Agent not less than ten business days prior to any
dividend or distribution record date; otherwise such withdrawal will be

                                                                        Page 25

SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC .



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

effective as soon as practicable after the Plan Agent's investment of the most
recently declared dividend or distribution on the Common Shares. The Plan may
be terminated by the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to Common Shareholders
at least 30 days prior to the record date for the payment of any dividend or
distribution by the Fund for which the termination is to be effective. Upon any
termination, you will be sent a certificate or certificates for the full Common
Shares held for you under the Plan and cash for any fractional Common Shares.
You may elect to notify the Plan Agent in advance of such termination to have
the Plan Agent sell part or all of your shares on your behalf. You will be
charged $5.00 plus a $0.05 per Common Share service charge and the Plan Agent
is authorized to deduct brokerage charges actually incurred for this
transaction from the proceeds.

There is no service charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases. Because all dividends and distributions will be automatically
reinvested in additional Common Shares, this allows you to add to your
investment through dollar cost averaging, which may lower the average cost of
your Common Shares over time.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, the change is warranted. There is no direct service
charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to
amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.
Additional information about the Plan and your account may be obtained from the
Plan Agent at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
         develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the
         Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a
         group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc.
         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the
         general principles set forth above and considering such enumerated
         factors. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated
         position or list of factors that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the
         general principles set forth above. Issues for which there is a stated
         position set forth in the Policies or for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issues fall into a variety of categories, including election of
         directors, ratification of auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses,
         capital structure issues, executive and director

<PAGE>

         compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and social and
         environmental issues. The stated position on an issue set forth in the
         Policies can always be superseded, subject to the duty to act solely
         in the best interest of the beneficial owners of accounts, by the
         investment management professionals responsible for the account whose
         shares are being voted. Issues applicable to a particular industry may
         cause CAM to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to
         issuers generally. As a result of the independent investment advisory
         services provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be
         occasions when different business units or different portfolio
         managers within the same business unit vote differently on the same
         issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their
         personal relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise
         during the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to
         bring conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the
         attention of compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and
         considers a list of significant relationships that could present a
         conflict of interest for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is
         also sensitive to the fact that a significant, publicized relationship
         between an issuer and a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public
         to influence the manner in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy
         with respect to such issuer. Absent special circumstances or a
         significant, publicized non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the
         Manager for prudential reasons treats as a potential conflict of
         interest because such relationship might appear to the public to
         influence the manner in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the
         Manager generally takes the position that non-CAM relationships
         between Citigroup and an issuer (e.g. investment banking or banking)
         do not present a conflict of interest for the Manager in voting
         proxies with respect to such issuer. Such position is based on the
         fact that the Manager is operated as an independent business unit from
         other Citigroup business units as well as on the existence of
         information barriers between the Manager and certain other Citigroup
         business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest brought to
         its attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that will be
         voted in accordance with a stated position on an issue or in
         accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party is
         not brought to the attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a
         conflict of interest review because the Manager's position is that to
         the extent a conflict of interest issue exists, it is resolved by
         voting in accordance with a pre-determined policy or in accordance
         with the recommendation of an independent third party. With respect to
         a conflict of interest brought to its attention, the

<PAGE>

         Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether such conflict of
         interest is material. A conflict of interest is considered material to
         the extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to
         influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in
         voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that
         a conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote proxies
         notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.

     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial information included in this report,
     and the financial statements on which the financial information is based,

     statements are required to include a statement of cash flows) of the
     registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the registrant and
     have:

     a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          evaluation; and

     c)   Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and

     b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
