Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

As I write to you at February month-end, fixed income markets in the United
States continued to reward those investors willing to accept greater risk. The
high yield market, as measured by the Credit Suisse First Boston High Yield
Index, provided a return of +10.88% over the past six months and +25.17% for the
12-month period ended February 29, 2004. In other areas of fixed income,
investment grade corporate bonds, as measured by the Merrill Lynch Corporate
Master Index, returned +6.59% and +8.11% for the six-month and 12-month periods
ended February 29, 2004, respectively. Treasury issues, as measured by the
Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasuries 1 - 10 Years Index, returned +3.16% and +2.73% for
the six-month and 12-month periods ended February 29, 2004, respectively.

At the same time, equity markets maintained their positive momentum from
year-end 2003. For the six-month and 12-month periods ended February 29, 2004,
the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index returned +14.59% and +38.52%,
respectively. Much of the boost came from improving economic conditions in the
United States.

The major signposts as we enter 2004 indicate that we are seeing a shift from
economic growth fueled primarily by fiscal and monetary stimulus to a
broader-based, self-sustaining economic expansion. Gross domestic product
growth, which peaked at an annualized rate of 8.2% in the third quarter of 2003,
was 4.1% in the fourth quarter. A similar level of growth is expected in the
first quarter of 2004. For its part, the Federal Reserve Board has reiterated
its willingness to keep short-term interest rates at current low levels to
ensure the economy's strength.

Accompanying the increase in economic activity was an improvement in corporate
earnings. By February 10, 2004, 392 of the S&P 500 companies had reported their
fourth-quarter 2003 results, and 67.6% of those exceeded expectations. In the
meantime, the American consumer, who continued to spend despite the faltering
economy, may get further incentive from another round of federal tax refunds
this year.

At Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, we believe the events and efforts of 2003
leave us with a much stronger economy and that recent optimism suggests it is
time for investors to consider what can go right in 2004. We encourage you to
revisit your portfolio and your asset allocation strategy to ensure you are well
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment
assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years ahead.

                                        Sincerely,


                                        /s/ Terry K. Glenn

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Managers

      The Fund provided superior returns during the fiscal year, significantly
outperforming its blended benchmark, primarily from its overweight bond position
in the robust high yield market.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended February 29, 2004, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 11.72% and 11.75%, based on a
year-end per share net asset value of $6.71 and a per share market price of
$6.69, respectively, and $.786 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total return on the Fund's Common Stock was +41.84%, based on a change in
per share net asset value from $5.35 to $6.71, and assuming reinvestment of
$.791 per share ordinary income dividends. The Fund's benchmark, which is an
equal blend of the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High Yield Index and the
CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, returned +17.62% for the same period.

For the six-month period ended February 29, 2004, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +16.88%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $6.07 to $6.71, and assuming reinvestment of $.370 per share income
dividends. The blended benchmark returned +7.75% for the same six-month period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section
included in this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As
a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the
Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment return based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What were the reasons for the Fund's significant outperformance of its
benchmark?

The strong performance is primarily attributed to two factors. First, we
maintained an overweight bond position throughout the year -- specifically, 80%
bonds and 20% bank loans. We initiated this strategy a couple of years ago as
short-term interest rates declined, given that lower rates would have a negative
effect on bank loan yields. The portfolio benefited particularly from its
wireless and cable positions as issues rated CCC and low-B outperformed the rest
of the index during this high yield market boom during the Fund's fiscal year.
Taken together, we had an overweight bond position that was supercharged by our
investment in the lower end of the spectrum, and this allowed the Fund to
outperform. The second strategy that had a positive effect on performance was
our decision to make fairly full use of our leverage facilities. Leverage was
maintained at around 30% of total assets throughout the fiscal year. (For a
complete discussion of the benefits and risks of leverage, see page 2 of this
report to shareholders.)

In terms of specific investments, the largest positive contributor this year was
Mission Energy. Although Mission disappointed last year, we maintained our
confidence in the company's coal-fired capacity. We started the period with $30
million in Mission bonds priced at $28. These bonds rallied close to par by the
end of the fiscal year. We took advantage of the rally and reduced our position
to $12.6 million bonds. The second-largest positive contributor was Coaxial
Communications. We began the year with a $20 million bond position marked at
$70. By August, this position had rallied in price to $106.4, the call price at
which the company redeemed this debt. Coaxial's ability to refinance its debt
resulted from a favorable financial market and a positive reassessment of cable
valuations. This constructive reassessment also benefited the portfolio's
third-best performer, Charter Communications. The Fund owns nearly $25 million
in Charter bond and bank loan positions, which rallied an average of 20 points
during the year.

The three positions that detracted the most from performance this year all fell
into the distressed investments bucket that we use in the Fund. Overall, the
negative impact of these positions was modest in relation to the significant
outperformance afforded by the Fund's top performers. The first, Viskase
Companies, Inc. is a maker of casings used in preparing and packaging processed
meat products. Viskase emerged from bankruptcy protection in April 2003, but
overcapacity in the industry continued to put downward pressure on the company's
financial results and on the value of its debt and equity securities. Following
the bankruptcy reorganization, we received $9.2 million in new bonds and an
equity interest in exchange for our $22 million bond position. We subsequently
sold the new bonds at a price of approxi-

mately $67 and retained the equity interest. The second, International Utility
Structures Inc. (IUS), is a Canadian holding company that owns equity in two
utility pole manufacturing operations in France and the United States. In August
2003, IUS failed to pay its coupon and shortly thereafter filed for the Canadian
equivalent of Chapter 11. As we ended the period, our $8.35 million bond
position had declined in price from $50 to $22, reflecting the company's efforts
to reduce cash burn in North America and stabilize French operations. Finally,
Archibald Candy, manufacturer of Fannie Farmer chocolates filed for bankruptcy
again in January 2004 and is conducting an orderly liquidation of its assets.
Our $3.1 million bond position was marked at $38 as of period-end.

Describe the market conditions that impacted the portfolio during the year.

The high yield rally continued to perform well through the end of the Fund's
fiscal year. This was primarily a spread compression rally as opposed to an
interest rate rally. The CSFB High Yield Index spread declined from 947 basis
points (9.47%) to 486 basis points during calendar year 2003. At the same time,
the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose from 3.83% to 4.25%. Treasury note
yields worked against the rally, but were more than offset by high yield spread
compression.

Perhaps the most important factor affecting high yield returns was the sharp
decline in the payment default rate. According to CSFB, the 12-month rolling
default rate declined from 14.9% at December 31, 2002 to 4.05% a year later. We
expect a continuation of lower default rates in 2004. Moody's is projecting a
default rate of 3% - 3.5% for the year.

Increased investor risk appetites accompanied the declining default rates. This
was the main catalyst for the $26.2 billion in high yield market inflows in
2003. (This represents actual new money entering the market for purchase of
existing or new high yield bonds.) The year 2003 also brought $133 billion in
new-issue volume -- that is, the transactions put together and brought to market
for the first time. At first glance, the figures appear to reflect a
supply/demand imbalance. However, the wide disparity between the two is
explained by the fact that nearly 80% of new issuance is attributed to
refinancing. Corporate treasurers took advantage of lower interest rates to
refinance and lengthen the maturity of their obligations.

Dynamics in the leveraged loan market mirrored those of the high yield market,
and we experienced spread compression in our bank loan portfolio. For BB-rated
loans, the spreads over LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) narrowed from 371
basis points in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 247 basis points a year later.
Despite this, loan demand remained strong given rising interest rate fears and
investors' inclination to be defensively positioned.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We trimmed or eliminated a number of positions that were lowest in the capital
structure, as these had the greatest run during the high yield rally. Many of
these were CCC-rated positions.

During the last quarter of the year, we initiated a shift toward bank loans. We
are most concerned about the potential impact of a rising 10-year Treasury note
yield. During August 2003, we saw the 10-year Treasury note yield whipsaw from
under 4% to 4.60%. At the same time, bonds that traded tight to the Treasury
declined several points. Such a scenario could happen again -- quickly. Our
strategy is to lower the duration of the portfolio, hence the shift toward bank
loans. We are also purchasing floating rate bonds. The aim is to lower the
negative impact on the portfolio's value that would result from rising interest
rates.

How would you characterize the portfolio's position at the close of the period?

We ended the period with an allocation close to 80% bonds and 20% bank loans.
Our target is a more defensive 70% bond/30% bank loan allocation during 2004.
Therefore, we would characterize our position as defensive while still focused
on maintaining the Fund's attractive yield. We plan to maintain leverage within
a target range of 25% - 30% of assets for the foreseeable future. We also
continue to be cautious and selective in adding new positions.

      LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one
      or more major United States banks, or (iii) the certificate of deposit
      rate. Corporate loans represent 26.3% of the Fund's net assets.
+     Non-income producing security.
++    For Fund compliance purposes, "Industry" means any one or more of the
      industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market
      indexes or ratings group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management.
      This definition may not apply for purposes of this report, which may
      combine such industry sub-classifications for reporting ease. These

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which may require the use of management accruals and estimates. The Fund
determines and makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common
Stock on a weekly basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including Corporate Loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in Corporate Loans could be
considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Corporate Loans are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Corporate Loans are valued at
the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
number of Corporate Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
Corporate Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
pricing matrices to determine valuations. If the pricing service does not
provide a value for the Corporate Loan, the Investment Adviser will value the
loan at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
Nasdaq National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available ask price for
short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange,
the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of the Fund. Long positions in securities
traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market, Nasdaq Small Cap or Bulletin
Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund. Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued
at the last available ask price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in
the OTC market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and
most representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the
premium received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to
reflect the current market value of the option written, based on the last sale
price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded
in the OTC market, the last ask price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued
at their last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case
of options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. The swaps, including
interest rate swaps, caps and floors, will be determined by obtaining dealer
quotations. Other investments, including futures contracts and related options,
are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost unless the Investment Adviser believes that
this method no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase agreements will be
valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Fund employs certain pricing services
to provide securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for which
market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors of the Fund,
including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the Fund,
which may use a matrix system for valuations. The procedures of a pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general supervision of the Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Directors.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities
and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various
times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of
such times. Foreign currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior
to the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values
of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which
they are determined and the close of business on the NYSE that may not be
reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for
example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural disaster) occur
during such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, those securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in
good faith by the

Board of Directors or by the Investment Adviser using a pricing service and/or
procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked
      to market to reflect the current market value of the option written. When
      a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the
      related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the
      basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
      of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
      closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to
      the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent
      the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are
      over-the-counter contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to
      make periodic net payments on a specified notional amount. The net
      payments can be made for a set period of time or may be triggered by a
      pre-determined credit event. The net periodic payments may be based on a
      fixed or variable interest rate; the change in market value of a specified
      security, basket of securities, or index; or the return generated by a
      security.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(h) Reclassification -- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America require that certain components of net assets be adjusted to
reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly,
the current year's permanent book/tax difference of $664,968 has been
reclassified between undistributed net investment income and accumulated net
realized capital losses. This reclassification has no effect on net assets or
net asset value per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner. FAM has entered into a Sub-Advisory
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Asset Management U.K. Limited ("MLAM U.K."), an
affiliate of FAM, pursuant to which MLAM U.K. provides investment advisory
services to FAM with respect to the Fund. There is no increase in the aggregate
fees paid by the Fund for these services.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith Incorporated, a subsidiary
of ML & Co., received $5,094 in commissions on the execution of portfolio
security transactions for the Fund for the year ended February 29, 2004.

For the year ended February 29, 2004, the Fund reimbursed FAM $13,759 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, MLAM U.K., PSI, and/or ML & Co.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the
year ended February 29, 2004 were $654,892,385 and $618,352,718, respectively.

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 28, 2003, the Fund entered into its $318,000,000 revolving credit and
security agreement with Citibank, N.A. and other lenders (the "Lenders"). Under
the revolving credit and security agreement, the Fund may borrow money through
(i) a line of credit from certain Lenders at the eurodollar rate plus .75% or
the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus .50%, a base rate as determined by
Citibank, N.A. and/or the latest three-week moving average of secondary market
morning offering rates in the United States for three-month certificates of
deposit of major U.S. money market banks plus .50%, or (ii) the issuance of
commercial paper notes by certain Lenders at rates of interest based upon the
weighted average of the per annum rates paid or payable by

such Lenders in respect of those commercial paper notes. As security for its
obligations to the Lenders under the revolving credit and security agreement,
the Fund has granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to
and in favor of the Lenders. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs which
include a commitment fee for this facility at the annual rate of .10% and a
program fee of .24% on the borrowings outstanding.

For the year ended February 29, 2004, the average amount borrowed was
approximately $239,315,000 and the daily weighted average interest rate was
1.42%.

7. Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund paid an ordinary income dividend in the amount of $.057000 per share on
March 31, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2004.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended February
29, 2004 and February 28, 2003 was as follows:

As of February 29, 2004, the components of accumulated losses on a tax basis
were as follows:

*     On February 29, 2004, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $305,457,461, of which $263,491 expires in 2005, $12,067,388 expires in
      2006, $27,376,921 expires in 2007, $51,234,056 expires in 2008,
      $21,442,332 expires in 2009, $90,564,493 expires in 2010, $85,285,305
      expires in 2011 and $17,223,475 expires in 2012. This amount will be
      available to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales,
      book/tax differences in the accrual of income on securities in default,
      the difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
      discounts on fixed income securities, the deferral of post-October capital
      losses for tax purposes and other book/tax temporary differences.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by Federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested by
The Bank of New York (the "Plan Agent"), as agent for shareholders in
administering the Plan, in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund.
Holders of Common Stock who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of
record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name then to such
nominee) by The Bank of New York, as dividend paying agent. Such participants
may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all distributions of
dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to The Bank
of New York, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if received by the Plan
Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend
or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired by
the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the circumstances
described below, either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of Common Stock from the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii)
by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market
("open-market purchases") on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If on the
payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common Stock
is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common Stock plus
estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being referred to herein as
"market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly
issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued shares of
Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
current market price per share on the date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If on
the dividend payment date the net asset value per share is greater than the
market value (such condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the
participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which
open-market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date, which typically
will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly issued
shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is
unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and will
invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at
the close of business on the last purchase date determined by dividing the
uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (concluded)

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares
of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan
on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the record
shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the record
shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the
Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable either in
shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any Federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available to
shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus commissions
of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants in the Plan will
receive shares of the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and
will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market price plus
commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a premium
over net asset value, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a
greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible
that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If
the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the
taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders,
including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the
discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right
to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY
10286-1258, Telephone: 800-432-8224.

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide current income by investing
primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies' debt instruments,
including corporate loans, that are rated in the lower rating categories of the
established rating services (Baa or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
BBB or lower by Standard & Poor's) or unrated debt instruments of comparable
quality.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus. Past performance results shown in this report should not be
considered a representation of future performance. The Fund leverages its Common
Stock to provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of

likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common
Stock shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may
reduce the Common Stock's yield. Statements and other information herein are as

         The nature of the services include assurance and related services
         reasonably related to the performance of the audit of financial
         statements not included in Audit Fees above.

         (c) Tax Fees -           Fiscal Year Ending February 29, 2004 - $5,200

                                  Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2003 - $0

         (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
         registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
         provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to the
         registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly to the
         operations and the financial reporting of the registrant. Certain of
         these non-audit services that the Committee believes are a) consistent
         with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b) routine and recurring
         services that will not impair the independence of the independent
         accountants may be approved by the Committee without consideration on a
         specific case-by-case basis ("general pre-approval"). However, such
         services will only be deemed pre-approved provided that any individual
         project does not exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or
         $50,000 for the project as a whole. Any proposed services exceeding the
         pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee, as will any other services not subject to general
         pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services). The
         Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

         (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined that
         the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the

         by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides
         ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant
         to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
         Management Investment Companies -

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that that the Investment Adviser
         considers the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not
         the interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that
         real (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the
         Investment Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's
         clients are properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a

<PAGE>

         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

<PAGE>

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.
