PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


Dear Shareholder:

In 2004, Colonial Funds became part of the Bank of America family, one of the
largest, most respected financial institutions in the United States. As a direct
result of this merger, a number of changes are in the works that we believe
offer significant potential benefits for our shareholders. First, some funds may
be merged in order to eliminate redundancies, others may be liquidated and fund
management teams will be aligned to maximize performance potential. You will
receive more detailed information about these changes if your fund is affected
and you may be asked to vote on certain fund changes. In this matter, your
timely response will enable us to implement the changes in 2005.

As a result of these changes, we believe we will offer shareholders an even
stronger lineup of investment options. What will not change as we enter this
next phase of consolidation is our commitment to the highest standards of
performance and our dedication to superior service. Change for the good has
another name: it's called improvement. It helps move us forward, and we believe
that it represents progress for all our shareholders in their quest for
long-term financial success.

In the pages that follow, you'll find a detailed report from the fund's manager
or managers on key factors that influenced your fund's performance. We hope that
you will read the manager reports carefully and discuss any questions you might
have with your financial advisor.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial Funds. We appreciate your
continued confidence. And, we look forward to helping you keep your long-term
financial goals on target in the years to come.

Sincerely,

/s/ Christopher L. Wilson

Sector and quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of total
investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the lowest rating
assigned to a particular bond by one of the following nationally-recognized
rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Ltd. The majority of the
bonds that are non-rated are considered by the advisor to be of non-investment
grade quality.

Because the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
continue to invest in these sectors or maintain this quality breakdown in the
future.

For the 12-month period ended November 30, 2004, Colonial Investment Grade
Municipal Trust generated a total return of 0.64%, based on its market price.
Changes in the market price of the trust's shares reflect investor demand and
are not necessarily linked directly to changes in the trust's net asset value.
The trust returned 3.19%, based on investment at net asset value. The trust's
return fell short of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged)
Category average, which returned 5.69% for the same period.1 We believe that the
trust's sizeable position in Treasury futures and an above-average stake in zero
coupon and noncallable bonds hampered its return.

POSITIONED FOR RISING INTEREST RATES

Municipal bond prices alternately rose and fell as expectations for the economy
and interest rates changed over the course of the year. We positioned the trust
with the expectation that yields would move higher, pulling bond prices down.
While the trust benefited when bond prices declined, it lost ground during the
market's rallies. In particular, our use of Treasury futures contracts to manage
the trust's overall sensitivity to interest rate changes detracted from
performance. Treasury futures are agreements to buy or sell Treasury notes or
bonds at a set time in the future. During the first four months of the period,
the market rallied and long-term (10- and 30-year) Treasuries were among the
best performers. Since the trust was short the sector, the value of those
futures contracts declined, hurting the trust's performance. As the year
progressed, we slightly reduced the trust's reliance on Treasury futures as we
repositioned the bonds in the portfolio.

NONCALLABLES FALTER IN SIDEWAYS MARKET

The trust's above-average stake in zero coupon ("zeros") and other noncallable
municipal bonds also hampered returns. Noncallable bonds often have higher
durations because they cannot be called--or redeemed--before their due dates.
Zeros carry no coupon and are bought at a steep discount to face value. Zeros
and other noncallables typically do well when interest rates are declining.
However, they did not rally when interest rates fell during this reporting
period because investors were not convinced that the rally would continue. In
addition, there was a glut of zero coupon bonds in the market. We began paring
back on zeros and other noncallables, but still had an above-average stake at
period end. To help replace the yield lost from these sales, we bought
higher-yielding BBB and non-rated municipal bonds.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

HIGHER-YIELDING BONDS BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DEMAND

Riskier, lower quality, higher-yielding issues were strong contributors to
performance. Among the trust's top gainers were investor owned electric
utilities, such as Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and Systems Energy
Resources Project (0.4% and 0.5% of total investments, respectively), which
performed well as concerns that had lingered since the Enron scandal finally
began to dissipate.2 In addition, health care bonds continued to help
performance, as did multi-family housing bond pools. Finally, continuing care
retirement bonds rallied with the best gains coming from new facilities, such as
Kahala Nui Project (0.3% of total investments), which neared completion. Returns
from airline bonds were mixed as USAirways filed for bankruptcy and others
negotiated labor concessions to help them avoid bankruptcy.

POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH, HIGHER YIELDS

Looking ahead, we expect to see economic growth continue and yields drift
higher. We plan to keep the trust positioned for modestly rising yields,
boosting its stake in higher-yielding bonds and reducing its investments in zero
coupon and other noncallable bonds. As we accomplish this repositioning, we
expect to rely less on futures contracts.

Performance data quoted represents past performance and current performance may
be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The values of fixed-income securities generally move inversely with changes in
interest rates such that when interest rates rise, bond values fall and vice
versa. Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in
high-yield securities offers the potential for high current income and
attractive total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks
include default of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax
for individuals and corporations. Please see Federal Income Tax Information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

November 30, 2004


NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts
business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"),
as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Trust seeks as high a level of after-tax return as is consistent with
prudent risk, by pursuing current income generally exempt from ordinary federal
income tax and opportunities for long-term appreciation from a portfolio
primarily invested in investment grade municipal bonds.

TRUST SHARES

The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the Trust's
Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal, institutional-size
trading units of similar securities. The services may use various pricing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data, as
well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations are readily
available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation. Certain
debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of lesser quality, are
priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial condition of the issuer
and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations developed through pricing
techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized upon sale of the
securities, and the potential variation may be greater for those securities
valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or quotations
which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures established by
and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin receivable or payable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Trust
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies cash or
liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an amount equal
to the delayed delivery commitment.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Original issue discount is
accreted to interest income over the life of the security with a corresponding
increase in the cost basis. Premium and discount are amortized and accreted,
respectively, on all debt securities. Dividend income is recorded on ex date.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

November 30, 2004



FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will distribute
substantially all of its tax-exempt or taxable income, if any, for its tax year,
and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust
intends to distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net
investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that
the Trust should not be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal
income or excise tax provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions
to Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of
each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally
seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on November 30, 2004, was
1.55%. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the Trust declared dividends to
Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $634,050, representing an average
dividend rate of 1.06% per APS.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Trust's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

For the year ended November 30, 2004, permanent book and tax basis differences
resulting primarily from differing treatments for discount accretion/premium
amortization on debt securities and market discount reclassifications were
identified and reclassified among the components of the Trust's net assets as
follows:

      UNDISTRIBUTED
     NET INVESTMENT         ACCUMULATED
         INCOME          NET REALIZED LOSS    PAID-IN CAPITAL
   -------------------    --------------        -----------
        $(20,312)             $20,312               $--

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November 30, 2004
and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

                      NOVEMBER 30, 2004   NOVEMBER 30, 2003
                      ----------------    ----------------
Distributions paid from:
   Tax-Exempt Income       $8,451,630         $8,411,303
   Ordinary Income              8,542             30,543
   Long-Term Capital Gains         --                 --

As of November 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

                  UNDISTRIBUTED  UNDISTRIBUTED
   UNDISTRIBUTED    ORDINARY       LONG-TERM  NET UNREALIZED
TAX-EXEMPT INCOME    INCOME      CAPITAL GAINS APPRECIATION*
 ----------------   ---------    ------------  -------------
    $1,084,842         $--            $--       $8,383,010

*    The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
     appreciation are primarily due to discount accretion/premium amortization
     on debt securities.

Unrealized appreciation and depreciation at November 30, 2004, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes was:

   Unrealized appreciation                      $13,963,491
   Unrealized depreciation                       (5,580,481)
                                                -----------
   Net unrealized appreciation                  $ 8,383,010
                                                -----------


The following capital loss carryforwards, determined as of November 30, 2004,
may be available to reduce taxable income arising from future net realized gains
on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

              YEAR OF                 CAPITAL LOSS
            EXPIRATION                CARRYFORWARD

               2008                    $1,913,022
               2010                     1,238,884
                                       ----------
                                       $3,151,906
                                       ----------


Capital loss carryforwards of $490,635 were utilized during the year ended
November 30, 2004 for the Trust.

November 30, 2004



NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia") is the investment advisor to the
Trust. Prior to April 1, 2004, Columbia was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Trust's investment advisor, was acquired by Bank of
America Corporation ("BOA"). The acquisition did not change the way the Trust is
managed, the investment personnel assigned to manage the Trust or the fees paid
by the Trust.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

Columbia provides administrative and other services to the Trust in addition to
investment advisory services. Columbia receives a monthly investment advisory
fee at the annual rate of 0.65% of the Trust's average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, Columbia pays the total fees received
to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to APS,
exceed $50 million, an additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is
calculated by taking into account the fees payable to State Street under the
Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to the average weekly net assets,
including assets applicable to APS, of the Trust for that month. The Trust also
pays additional fees for pricing services based on the number of securities held
by the Trust. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the Trust's effective
pricing and bookkeeping fee rate, inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses, was
0.052% of the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to
APS.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement
in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES

With the exception of one officer, all officers of the Trust are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates and receive no compensation from the Trust. Effective
August 23, 2004, the Board of Trustees appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to
the Trust in accordance with federal securities regulations. The Trust, along
with other affiliated trusts, will pay its pro-rata share of the expenses
associated with the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer.

The Trust's fee will not exceed $15,000 per year. The Trust's Trustees may
participate in a deferred compensation plan which may be terminated at any time.
Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of the Trust's assets.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the year ended November 30, 2004, the Trust paid $1,489 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the year ended November 30, 2004, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $27,371,224 and
$28,178,088, respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 2,400 APS. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the
APS' rating agencies. Should these requirements not be met, or should dividends
accrued on the APS not be paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to
declare dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem certain
APS. At November 30, 2004, there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS
AND CONTINGENCIES

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Trust holds investments that are insured by private insurers who guarantee
the payment of principal and interest in the event of default or that are
supported by a letter of credit. Each of the Trust's insurers is rated AAA by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc., except for Radian Asset Assurance, Inc., which
is rated AA by Standard and Poor's. At November 30, 2004, investments supported
by private insurers that represent greater than 5% of the total investments of
the Trust were as follows:

                                % OF TOTAL
INSURER                         INVESTMENTS
- -------------------------------------------
MBIA Insurance Corp.               19.2%
Ambac Assurance Corp.              11.1
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.    7.6

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

November 30, 2004


GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at November 30, 2004
invested in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Florida,
Illinois, New York and Texas and their respective political subdivisions,
agencies and public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to economic and
political factors adversely affecting issuers of these state's municipal
securities than are municipal bond funds that are not concentrated to the same
extent in these issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES

Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk bonds." Economic
downturns and industry events may disrupt the high yield market and impair the
ability of issuers to repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in
interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on the value of such
obligations. Moreover, high-yield securities may be less liquid to the extent
there is no established secondary market.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Columbia, Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. ("CFDI"), and certain of their
affiliates (collectively, "the Columbia Group") have received information
requests and subpoenas from various regulatory and law enforcement authorities
in connection with their investigations of late trading and market timing in
mutual funds as well as other industry wide issues. The Columbia Group has not
uncovered any instances where Columbia or CFDI were knowingly involved in late
trading of mutual fund shares.

On February 24, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a
civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against Columbia and CFDI, alleging that they had violated certain
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with trading activity in
mutual fund shares. Also on February 24, 2004, the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") filed a civil complaint in New York Supreme Court, County of New York
against Columbia and CFDI alleging that Columbia and CFDI had violated certain
New York anti-fraud statutes. If either Columbia or CFDI is unsuccessful in its
defense of these proceedings, it could be barred from serving as an investment
advisor or distributor for any investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (a "registered investment company").
Such results could prevent Columbia, CFDI or any company that is an affiliated
person of Columbia and CFDI from serving as an investment advisor or distributor
for any registered investment company, including your fund. Your fund has been
informed by Columbia and CFDI that, if these results occur, they will seek
exemptive relief from the SEC to permit them to continue to serve as your fund's
investment advisor and distributor. There is no assurance that such exemptive
relief will be granted. On March 15, 2004, Columbia and CFDI entered into
agreements in principle with the SEC Division of Enforcement and NYAG in
settlement of the charges. Under the agreements, Columbia and CFDI agreed, among
other things, to the following conditions: payment of $70 million in
disgorgement; payment of $70 million in civil penalties; an order requiring
Columbia and CFDI to cease and desist from violations of the antifraud
provisions and other provisions of the federal securities laws; governance
changes designed to maintain the independence of the mutual fund boards of
trustees and ensure compliance with securities laws and their fiduciary duties;
and retention of an independent consultant to review Columbia's and CFDI's
compliance policies and procedures. The agreement requires the final approval of
the SEC. In a separate agreement with the NYAG, the Columbia Group and its
affiliate Banc of America Capital Management, LLC have agreed to collectively
reduce mutual fund fees by $160 million over a five-year period.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain funds, their Boards and/or FleetBoston (and
affiliated entities). More than 300 cases (including those filed against
entities unaffiliated with the funds, their Boards and/or FleetBoston and its
affiliated entities) have been consolidated in a multi-district proceeding and
transferred to the Federal District Court in Maryland. Recently, certain
Columbia funds and affiliated entities have been named as defendants in several
derivative actions under various sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, alleging, among other things, that the fees and expenses paid by
those funds are excessive. The funds and the other defendants to these actions,
including Columbia and various of its affiliates, certain other mutual funds
advised by Columbia and its affiliates, and various directors of such funds,
have denied these allegations and are contesting the plaintiffs' claims. These
suits and certain regulatory investigations are ongoing, however, based on
currently available information, Columbia believes that these lawsuits are
without merit, that the likelihood they will have a material adverse impact on
any fund is remote, and that the lawsuits are not likely to materially affect
its ability to provide investment management services to its clients, including
the funds.

financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
November 30, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL TRUST

Pursuant to the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all
shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
distributions reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Trust by
EquiServe (the "Plan Agent") unless a shareholder elects to receive cash.
Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee will have
distributions reinvested automatically by the broker or nominee in additional
shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the broker or the
nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash. If the
service is not available, such distributions will be paid in cash. Shareholders
whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact the
broker or nominee for details. All distributions to shareholders who elect not
to participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed directly to the
shareholder of record on the record date therefore by the Plan Agent as the
dividend disbursing agent.

Non-participants in the Plan will receive distributions in cash. Distributions
payable to participants in the Plan will be applied by the Plan Agent, acting as
agent for Plan participants, to the purchase of shares of the Trust. Such shares
will be purchased by the Plan Agent at the then current market price of such
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to his
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's notice of election
to withdraw from the Plan must be received by the Plan Agent before the record
date for a dividend in order to be given effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting distributions. The Plan
Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of distributions will be paid
by the Trust. Each participant in the Plan will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of distributions. Purchase orders
from the participants in the Plan may be combined with those of other
participants and the price paid by any particular participant may be the average
of the price paid on various orders executed on behalf of groups of participants
in the Plan.

The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of any
income tax that may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010, or by phone at 1-800-730-6001.

(e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the "Policy")
which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which the Audit
Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit (including audit related,
tax and all other) services

<PAGE>

provided by the registrant's independent auditor to the registrant and
individual funds (collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all non-audit services
provided by the registrant's independent auditor to the funds' adviser or a
control affiliate of the adviser, that relate directly to the funds' operations
and financial reporting (collectively "Fund-related Adviser Services"). A
"control affiliate" is an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the funds, and the
term "adviser" is deemed to exclude any unaffiliated sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another
investment adviser. The adviser and control affiliates are collectively referred
to as "Adviser Entities."

The Audit Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case basis as
potential services are contemplated) and general (pre-determined list of
permitted services) pre-approvals. Unless a type of service has received general
pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it
is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The Policy does not delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration
shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general pre-approval.

These schedules will provide a description of each type of service that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fees
for each instance of providing each service. This general pre-approval and
related fees (where provided) will generally cover a one-year period (for
example, from June 1 through May 31 of the following year). The Audit
Committee will review and approve the types of services and review the projected
fees for the next one-year period and may add to, or subtract from, the list of
general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations. This approval acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in
agreement with the specific types of services that the independent auditor will
be permitted to perform. The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary
at other regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has the
authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate amount of non-audit services
provided to an individual fund.

If, subsequent to general pre-approval, a fund, its investment adviser or a
control affiliate determines that it would like to engage the independent
auditor to perform a service that requires pre-approval and that is not included
in the general pre-approval list, the specific pre-approval procedure shall be
as follows:

     o    A brief written request shall be prepared by management detailing the
          proposed engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed to
          be performed by the independent auditor;

     o    The request should be addressed to the Audit Committee with copies to
          the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;

     o    The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will
          arrange for a discussion of the service to be included on the agenda
          for the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, when the
          Committee will discuss the proposed engagement and approve or deny the
          request.

     o    If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
          commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairperson
          of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of
          the Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine to
          call a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of
          considering the proposal. Should the Chairperson of the Audit
          Committee be unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee may
          serve as an alternate for the purpose of approving or denying the
          request. Discussion with the Chairperson (or alternate, if necessary)
          will be arranged by the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee
          Administration. The independent auditor will not commence any such
          project unless and until specific approval has been given.

III. CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed to
be provided by the independent auditor to the adviser or control affiliates are
not Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of the Policy, but
nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing evaluation of the
auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its audit services to the
funds. As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
auditor to provide audit or non-audit services that are not Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit
Committee, and the projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of
all such engagements during the period covered by the Policy) exceeds a
pre-determined threshold established by the Audit Committee; the independent
auditor, Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will notify
the Audit Committee not later than its next meeting. Such notification shall
include a general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be
the recipient of such services, the timing of the engagement, the entity's
reasons for selecting the independent auditor, and the projected fees. Such
information will allow the Audit Committee to consider whether non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject to
Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the auditor's
independence with respect to the Funds.

IV.      REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

<PAGE>

The Fund Treasurer or Director of Trustee Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered,
including:

     o    A general description of the services, and

     o    Actual billed and projected fees, and

     o    The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser Services
          were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

In addition, the independent auditor shall report to the Audit Committee
annually, and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the
SEC, all non-audit services provided to entities in the funds' "investment
company complex," as defined by SEC rules, that did not require pre-approval
under the Policy.

V.   AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Policy may be amended from time to time by the Audit Committee. Prompt
notice of any amendments will be provided to the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee Administration. The Policy shall be reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

                                      *****

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during both fiscal years ended
November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003 was zero.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2004 and
November 30, 2003 are disclosed in (b) through (d) of this Item.

During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003, there
were no Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees or All Other Fees that were approved for
services to the investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant under
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

The percentage of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees required to be
approved under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X that were
approved under the "de minimis" exception during both fiscal years ended
November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003 was zero.

<PAGE>

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X, is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence. The Audit Committee determined that the provision of such services
is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). Douglas A. Hacker, Thomas E. Stitzel, Anne-Lee Verville and
Richard L. Woolworth are each independent trustees and collectively constitute
the entire Audit Committee.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The registrant's "Schedule I - Investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers" (as set forth in 17 CFR 210.12-12) is included in Item 1 of this Form
N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of
the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each proposal and votes the
proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the proposal would be
expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund. The Advisor
determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential economic
return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any

<PAGE>

benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. The
Advisor's Proxy Committee is composed of representatives of the Advisor's equity
investments, equity research, compliance, legal and fund administration
functions. In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Proxy
Committee has the responsibility to review, on a semi-annual basis, the
Advisor's proxy voting policies to ensure consistency with internal policies and
regulatory agency policies and to develop additional voting guidelines to assist
in the review of proxy proposals.

The Proxy Committee may vary from the predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of the
issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best interest of the client.
References to the best interest of a client refer to the interest of the client
in terms of the potential economic return on the client's investment. In
determining the vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any
benefit other than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted. A member
of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for which he or
she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship with the
issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to disclose
to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or other matter
known to the person that would create a potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third
party vendor, to implement its proxy voting process. ISS provides proxy
analysis, record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE


          This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
     the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the "Funds" and
     each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal Executive Officer,
     Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, and Director of
     Trustee Administration (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of
     promoting:


     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in other public communications
          made by a Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.


          Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of business
     ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE


          The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
     (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be primarily
     responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). The
     Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management Group Compliance
     Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his or her designee shall
     serve as the Code Officer, but only on a temporary basis.

          Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief Legal
     Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
     promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund shall assist the
     Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Chief Legal Officer
     shall be responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
     questions are presented under it (in consultation with Fund counsel, where
     appropriate) and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular
     situation. However, any

<PAGE>

     waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
     Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST


          OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
     private interest interferes with the interests of, or his/her service to, a
     Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
     or a family member, receives improper personal benefits as a result of the
     Covered Officer's position with a Fund.

          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
     Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
     provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Company Act") and
     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"). For example,
     Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such
     as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with a Fund
     because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and
     its investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
     prevent, or identify and correct, violations of those provisions. This Code
     does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those programs and
     procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

          Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
     benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
     relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser, administrator,
     principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
     (each, a "Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
     officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
     Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
     Fund or for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing
     policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
     Service Provider and a Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in
     such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the
     Fund and the Service Provider and is consistent with the performance by the
     Covered Officers of their duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is
     recognized by the Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
     employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or
     other codes.

          Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
     conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the Company Act and
     the Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
     interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that
     these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
     personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly
     before the interest of a Fund.

<PAGE>

     Each Covered Officer must:


     o    not use personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by a Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer or an immediate family member would
          benefit personally to the detriment of a Fund; and

     o    not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer or an immediate
          family member rather than the benefit of the Fund.1.

          There are some conflict of interest situations that must be approved
     by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief Legal Officer. Those
     situations include, but are not limited to,:


     o    service as director on the board of any public or private company;

     o    the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the aggregate from a
          third party that does or seeks to do business with the Funds during
          any 12-month period;

     o    the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings, unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     o    any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any Fund service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof;

     o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
          transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     Each Covered Officer shall:

     o    be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to
          the Funds;

- ----------------------
1 For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered Officers
shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<PAGE>

     o    not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts
          about any Fund to others, whether within or outside the Fund,
          including to the Fund's trustees and auditors, and to governmental
          regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    to the extent appropriate within his/her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and the adviser
          with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
          understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file
          with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
          the Funds; and

     o    promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
          applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered Officer),
          affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has received, read and
          understands the Code;

     o    annually affirm to the Board compliance with the requirements of the
          Code;

     o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
          that are made in good faith;

     o    notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer promptly if he/she
          knows of any violation of this Code; and

     o    respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires circulated
          periodically in connection with the preparation of disclosure
          documents for the Funds.


     The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities related to this
Code.

     The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o    The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will take all
          appropriate action to investigate any potential violation reported to
          him/her;

     o    If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and the Code
          Officer believes that no violation has occurred, the Code Officer will
          notify the person(s) reporting the potential violation, and no further
          action is required;

     o    Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer
          believes is a violation will be reported to the Audit Committee;

<PAGE>

     o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          the Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or a
          recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o    The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers in its
          sole discretion;

     o    Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Chief Legal Officer shall:

     o    report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals provided in
          accordance with Section III of this Code; and

     o    report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations of, or material
          issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
     the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
     forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
     other polices or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers
     govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities (including, but not
     limited to, personal trading activities) of the Covered Officers who are
     subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that
     they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and
     their investment advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of ethics
     under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and any policies and procedures of
     the Service Providers are separate requirements applicable to the Covered
     Officers and are not part of this Code.

VII. AMENDMENTS

          All material amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by
     the Board, including a majority of independent directors.

VIII. CONFIDENTIALITY

          All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
     will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
     accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
     shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Board, the Covered
     Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code Officer, outside audit firms
     and legal counsel to the Funds, and senior management of Columbia
     Management Group.

<PAGE>

IX.  INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
     not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
     circumstance, or legal conclusion.
