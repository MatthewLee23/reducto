PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


Dear Shareholder:

In 2004, Colonial Funds became part of Columbia Management, the asset management
division of Bank of America, one of the largest, most respected financial
institutions in the United States. As a direct result of this merger, a number
of changes are in the works that we believe offer significant potential benefits
for our shareholders. First, some funds may be merged in order to eliminate
redundancies, others may be liquidated and fund management teams will be aligned
to maximize performance potential. You will receive more detailed information
about these changes if your fund is affected and you may be asked to vote on
certain fund changes. In this matter, your timely response will enable us to
implement the changes in 2005.

As a result of these changes, we believe we will offer shareholders an even
stronger lineup of investment options. What will not change as we enter this
next phase of consolidation is our commitment to the highest standards of
performance and our dedication to superior service. Change for the good has
another name: it's called improvement. It helps move us forward, and we believe
that it represents progress for all our shareholders in their quest for
long-term financial success.

In the pages that follow, you'll find a detailed report from the fund's manager
on key factors that influenced your fund's performance. We hope that you will
read the manager reports carefully and discuss any questions you might have with
your financial advisor.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial Funds. We appreciate your
continued confidence. And, we look forward to helping you keep your long-term
financial goals on target in the years to come.

Sincerely,

/s/ Christopher L. Wilson

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2005, Colonial Municipal Income Trust
generated a total return of 2.32%, based on its market price. The trust returned
6.12%, based on investment at net asset value. It fell slightly short of the
6.38% average return of its peer group, the Lipper High Yield Municipal Debt
Funds Category1 and the 6.77% average return of a customized peer group
consisting of nine leveraged closed-end high-yield municipal funds. The trust
benefited from strong demand for high-yield municipal bonds, which outstripped
supply as investors reached for yield in a low interest rate environment. Lower
quality, higher-yielding issues did particularly well. We believe that the trust
had less exposure than its customized peer group to the airline and tobacco
sectors, which somewhat hindered its relative return.

GAINS CAME FROM LONGER-MATURITY BIAS

Although short-term interest rates rose, long-term yields fell and long-term
bond prices rose. As a result, the trust benefited from having a sizable stake
in longer-maturity issues and downplaying weaker-performing short-maturity
bonds. In particular, the trust benefited from its stake in zero coupon
municipal bonds, or "zeros," which did well as long-term interest rates
declined. However, Treasury futures contracts, which were used to reduce the
duration of the trust, declined in value, offsetting some of the gains from the
trust's bonds. Zeros are long-term bonds that carry no coupon and are bought at
a steep discount to face value.

The trust's diversified approach meant that it had modest holdings in the
top-performing but volatile air transportation and tobacco sectors. Tobacco
bonds are issued by individual states, cities and counties. These bonds are
secured by revenues from a financial settlement with tobacco companies related
to past and future tobacco-related health costs. The sector benefited from
strong demand and positive litigation news during the period. Among airlines, US
Airways bonds (0.2% of total investments) were standouts.2 Elsewhere, we sold at
a loss some bonds that were issued for Westbridge Apartments, a multi-family
housing project in South Carolina, which was hurt by the loss of some government
contracts.

SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER QUALITY

The difference in yield between lower quality and higher quality bonds narrowed
during the period, giving us an opportunity to buy higher quality bonds without
sacrificing much yield. We trimmed some BBB-rated hospital bonds and replaced
them with AA-rated housing bonds that had a nice yield advantage over AAA-rated
issues, with only slightly lower yield than the hospital bonds.

Sector and quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of total
investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the rating
assigned to a particular bond by one of the following nationally- recognized
rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. The majority of the
bonds that are non-rated are considered by the advisor to be of non-investment
grade quality.

Because the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
continue to invest in these sectors or maintain this quality breakdown in the
future.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

DECLINE IN DIVIDEND, BUT CONTINUED BENEFIT FROM LEVERAGE

The trust's dividend yield dropped as long-term interest rates fell and
short-term interest rates rose. The trust earned some of its income through
leverage, which came from preferred shares that allow the trust to borrow
against its underlying investments. We invested the proceeds from the preferred
shares in longer maturity bonds and then paid out to preferred shareholders a
short-term rate that is influenced by the federal funds rate--the overnight rate
at which banks lend each other money. As the fed funds rate climbed, the payout
rate to preferred shareholders rose, reducing the income available to the common
shareholders. However, the leverage continued to give the trust an income
advantage over its non-leveraged peers.

POSITIVE OUTLOOK

With interest rates still at low levels, we expect demand for high-yield
municipals to remain strong. The yield differential between higher-rated and
lower-rated bonds, while narrow already, could narrow further and help
high-yield relative returns. However, our plan is to continue looking for
opportunities to upgrade credit quality without sacrificing much yield. In
addition, even if long-term interest rates head higher, we think the increases
are unlikely to be dramatic.

Performance data quoted represents past performance and current performance may
be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the
credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic
developments and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest
rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.

Investing in high-yield or "junk bonds" offers the potential for higher income
than investments in investment-grade bonds but they also have a higher degree of
risk. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect
a high-yield bond issuer's ability to make timely principal and interest
payments.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves
special risks. The value of the trust will be affected by interest rate changes
and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, if
applicable, the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains are not exempt from
income taxes. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

May 31, 2005 (Unaudited)



NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts business trust
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Trust seeks to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes, by investing primarily in medium and lower quality bonds and notes
issued by or on behalf of state and local government units whose interest is
exempt from ordinary federal income tax, other than the possible incidence of
any alternative minimum tax. The Trust's secondary goal is to seek total return.

TRUST SHARES

The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On July 20, 1999, the
Trust issued 3,600 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the Trust's
Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal, institutional-size
trading units of similar securities. The services may use various pricing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data, as
well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations are readily
available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation. Certain
debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of lesser quality, are
priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial condition of the issuer
and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations developed through pricing
techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized upon sale of the
securities, and the potential variation may be greater for those securities
valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Investments in other investment companies are valued at net asset value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or have
quotations which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures
established by and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin receivable or payable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES

Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from registration. In
some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust or
in connection with another registered offering of the securities.

19
<PAGE>

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2005 (Unaudited)



Many restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Trust
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies cash or
liquid portfolio securities in an amount equal to the delayed delivery
commitment.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions
and dividend income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will distribute
substantially all of its taxable income, if any, for its tax year, and as such
will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust intends to
distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income,
capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that the Trust should not
be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions
to Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of
each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally
seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2005, was
2.810%. For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the Trust declared dividends to
Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $ 912,896, representing an average
dividend rate of 2.03% per APS.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended November 30, 2004
was as follows:

                                               NOVEMBER 30,

                                        $42,977,890
                                      -------------

Capital loss carryforwards of $4,074 expired during the year ended November 30,
2004 for the Trust. Expired capital loss carryforwards are recorded as a
reduction of paid-in capital.

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor to
the Trust and provides administrative and other services to the Trust. Columbia
receives a monthly investment advisory fee at the annual rate of 0.65% of the
Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, Columbia pays the total fees received
to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to APS,
exceed $50 million, an additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is
calculated by taking into account the fees payable to State Street under the
Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to the

20
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2005 (Unaudited)




average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to APS, of the Trust for
that month. The Trust also pays additional fees for pricing services based on
the number of securities held by the Trust. For the six months ended May 31,
2005, the Trust's annualized effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate,
inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses, was 0.051% of the Trust's average weekly
net assets, including assets applicable to APS.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement
in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES

With the exception of one officer, all officers of the Trust are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates and receive no compensation from the Trust. The Board
of Trustees appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to the Trust in accordance with
federal securities regulations. The Trust, along with other affiliated funds,
will pay its pro-rata share of the expenses associated with the Office of the
Chief Compliance Officer. The Trust's fee for the Office of the Chief Compliance
Officer will not exceed $15,000 per year.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of
the Trust's assets.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the Trust paid $829 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the six months ended May 31, 2005, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $ 13,431,764 and
15,220,492 respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 3,600 APS. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At May 31, 2005, there
were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS
AND CONTINGENCIES

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Trust holds investments that are insured by private insurers who guarantee
the payment of principal and interest in the event of default or that are
supported by a letter of credit. Each of the Trust's insurers is rated AAA by
Moody's Investor Services, Inc. At May 31, 2005, private insurers who insure
greater than 5% of the total investments of the Trust were as follows:

                                             % OF TOTAL
INSURER                                      INVESTMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------
MBIA Insurance Corp.                              11.4%
Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp.                 7.0

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at May 31, 2005 invested
in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Texas and their respective political
subdivisions, agencies and public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to
economic and political factors adversely affecting issuers of the specific
state's municipal securities than are municipal bond funds that are not
concentrated to the same extent in these issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES

Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk bonds." Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to
repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would likely
have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover, high-yield
securities may be less liquid to the extent that there is no established
secondary market.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On February 9, 2005, Columbia and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc.
(collectively, the "Columbia Group") entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance
with the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlement") and
consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") (the "SEC

21
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2005 (Unaudited)



Order"). The SEC Order and the NYAG Settlement are referred to collectively as
the "Settlements". The Settlements contain substantially the same terms and
conditions as outlined in the agreements in principle which Columbia Group
entered into with the SEC and NYAG in March 2004.

Under the terms of the SEC Order, the Columbia Group has agreed among other
things, to: pay $70 million in disgorgement and $70 million in civil money
penalties; cease and desist from violations of the antifraud provisions and
certain other provisions of the federal securities laws; maintain certain
compliance and ethics oversight structures; retain an independent consultant to
review the Columbia Group's applicable supervisory, compliance, control and
other policies and procedures; and retain an independent distribution consultant
(see below). The Columbia Funds have also undertaken to implement certain
governance measures designed to maintain the independence of their boards of
trustees. The NYAG Settlement also, among other things, requires Columbia and
its affiliates, Banc of America Capital Management, LLC and BACAP Distributors,
LLC to reduce certain Columbia Funds, Nations Funds and other mutual funds
management fees collectively by $32 million per year for five years, for a
projected total of $160 million in management fee reductions.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the SEC order, the $140 million in
settlement amounts described above will be distributed in accordance with a
distribution plan to be developed by an independent distribution consultant, who
is acceptable to the SEC staff and the Columbia Funds' independent trustees. The
distribution plan must be based on a methodology developed in consultation with
the Columbia Group and the Trust's independent trustees and not unacceptable to
the staff of the SEC. At this time, the distribution plan is still under
development. As such, any gain to the fund or its shareholders can not currently
be determined.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, the market price of fund shares could decline.

A copy of the SEC Order is available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov. A
copy of the NYAG Settlement is available as part of the Bank of America
Corporation Form 8-K filing on February 10, 2005.

In connection with events described in detail above, various parties have filed
suit against certain funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, FleetBoston
Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of America
Corporation and its affiliated entities. More than 300 cases including those
filed against entities unaffiliated with the funds, their Boards, FleetBoston
Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of America
Corporation and its affiliated entities have been transferred to the Federal
District Court in Maryland and consolidated in a multi-district proceeding (the
"MDL").

The derivative cases purportedly brought on behalf of the Columbia Funds in the
MDL have been consolidated under the lead case. The fund derivative plaintiffs
allege that the funds were harmed by market timing and late trading activity and
seek, among other things, removal of the trustees of the Columbia Funds, removal
of the Columbia Group, disgorgement of all management fees and monetary damages.

On March 21, 2005 purported class action plaintiffs filed suit in Massachusetts
state court alleging that the conduct, including market timing, entitles Class B
shareholders in certain Columbia funds to an exemption from contingent deferred
sales charges upon early redemption (the "CDSC Lawsuit"). The CDSC Lawsuit has
been removed to federal court in Massachusetts and the federal Judicial Panel
has conditionally ordered its transfer to the MDL.

The MDL is ongoing. Accordingly, an estimate of the financial impact of this
litigation on any fund, if any, can not currently be made.

On January 11, 2005, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in federal
district court in Massachusetts against, among others, the Trustees of the
Columbia Funds and Columbia. The lawsuit alleges that defendants violated common
law duties to fund shareholders as well as sections of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, by failing to ensure that the Trust and other affiliated funds
participated in securities class action settlements for which the funds were
eligible. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to submit proof
of claims in connection with settlements of securities class action lawsuits
filed against companies in which the funds held positions.

In 2004, certain Columbia funds, advisers and affiliated entities were named as
defendants in certain purported shareholder class and derivative actions making
claims, including claims under the Investment Company and the Investment
Advisers Acts of 1940 and state law. The suits allege, inter alia, that the fees
and expenses paid by the funds are excessive and that the advisers and their
affiliates inappropriately used fund assets to distribute the funds and for
other improper purpose. On March 2, 2005, actions were consolidated in the
Massachusetts federal court as In re Columbia Entities Litigation. The
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on June 9, 2005.

The Trust and the other defendants to these actions, including Columbia and
various of its affiliates, certain other mutual funds advised by Columbia and
its affiliates, and various directors of such funds, have denied these
allegations and are contesting the plaintiffs' claims. These proceedings are
ongoing, however, based on currently available information, Columbia believes
that these lawsuits are without merit, that the likelihood they will have a
material adverse impact on any fund is remote, and that the lawsuits are not
likely to materially affect its ability to provide investment management
services to its clients, including the Trust.

(b)Effective December 1, 2001, the Trust adopted the provision of the AICPA
   Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
   market discount on all debt securities. The effect of this change, for the
   year ended November 30, 2002, was to increase the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets from 8.24% to 8.28% and increase the ratio of
   net investment income (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders) from 7.43% to 7.47%. The impact to net investment income and
   net realized and unrealized loss per share was less than $0.01. Per share

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

COLONIAL MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by Computershare (the "Plan Agent"), as agent under the
Trust's Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to
the Plan, the provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making
such an election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed
directly to the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the Trust.
If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend or
distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will be
issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the market
price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares at such
time, or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable only in
cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust shares in
the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average
per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value
of the Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to the
participant's account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be
made for any fraction of a share credited to such account.

Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments to
the Plan Agent semi-annually, for investment in the Trust's shares. Such
payments may be made in any amount from $100 to $500. State Street will use all
funds received from participants (as well as any dividends and distributions
received in cash) to purchase Trust shares in the open market semiannually.
Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions as well as from voluntary
cash payments. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts of stock for
individual accounts under the voluntary cash purchase provisions of the Plan are
expected to be less than the usual brokerage charges for individual transactions
of comparable size, because the Plan Agent will be purchasing shares for all
participants in blocks and charging to cash purchase Plan participants a pro
rated portion of the lower commissions usually obtainable on such block
purchases. The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not
relieve participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days written notice to the Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
Computershare by mail at P.O. Box 403011, Providence, RI 02940-3011, or by phone
at 1-800-426-5523.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") requires
that the Board of Trustees/Directors (the "Board") of the Columbia Funds (the
"Funds"), including a majority of the Trustees and Directors (collectively, the
"Trustees") who are not "interested persons" of the Trusts, as defined in the
1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"), annually review and approve the terms of
the Funds' investment advisory agreements. At a meeting held on October 13,
2004, the Board reviewed and approved the management contracts ("Advisory
Agreement") with Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("CMA") for the Fund.

At meetings held on September 23, 2004 and October 12, 2004, the Advisory Fees
and Expenses Committee (the "Committee") of the Board considered the factors
described below relating to the selection of CMA and the approval of the
Advisory Agreement. At a meeting held on October 13, 2004, the Board, including
the Independent Trustees (who were advised by their independent legal counsel),
considered these factors and reached the conclusions described below.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Board considered information regarding the nature, extent and quality of
services that CMA provides to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement. CMA
provided the most recent investment adviser registration form ("Form ADV") and
code of ethics for CMA to the Board. The Board reviewed information on the
status of Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and New York Attorney
General ("NYAG") proceedings against CMA and certain of its affiliates,
including the agreement in principle entered into with the SEC and the NYAG on
March 15, 2004 to settle civil complaints filed by the SEC and the NYAG relating
to trading activity in mutual fund shares.1

The Board evaluated the ability of CMA, including its resources, reputation and
other attributes, to attract and retain highly qualified research, advisory and
supervisory investment professionals. The Board considered information regarding
CMA's compensation program for its personnel involved in the management of the
Fund.

Based on these considerations and other factors, including those
referenced below, the Board concluded that they were generally satisfied with
the nature, extent and quality of the investment advisory services provided to
the Fund by CMA.

FUND PERFORMANCE AND EXPENSES

CMA provided the Board with relative performance and expense information for the
Fund in a report prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") an independent provider of
investment company data. The Board considered the total return performance
information, which included the ranking of the Fund within a performance
universe made up of funds with the same Lipper investment classification and
objective (the "Performance Universe") by total return for one-year, three-year,
five-year, ten-year or life of fund periods, as applicable. They also considered
the Fund's performance in comparison to the performance results of a group (the
"Performance Peer Group") of funds selected by Lipper based on similarities in
fund type (e.g. open-end), investment classification and objective, asset size,
load type and 12b-1/service fees and other expense features, and to the
performance results of the Fund's benchmark index. The Board reviewed a
description of Lipper's methodology for selecting the mutual funds in the Fund's
Performance Peer Group and Performance Universe.

The Board considered statistical information regarding the Fund's total expenses
and certain components thereof, including management fees (both actual
management fees based on expenses for advisory and administrative fees including
any reductions for fee waivers and expense reimbursements as well as contractual
management fees that are computed for a hypothetical level of assets), actual
non-management expenses, and fee waivers/caps and expense reimbursements. They
also considered comparisons of these expenses to the expense information for
funds within a group (the "Expense Peer Group") selected by Lipper based on
similarities in fund type (e.g. open-end), investment classification and
objective, asset size, load type and 12b-1/service fees and other expense
features (but which, unlike the Performance Peer Group,may include funds with
several different investment classifications and objectives) and an expense
universe ("Expense Universe") selected by Lipper based on the criteria for
determining the Expense Peer Group other than asset size. The expense
information in the Lipper report took into account all existing fee waivers and
expense reimbursements as well as all voluntary advisory fee reductions
applicable to certain Funds that were being proposed by management in order to
reduce the aggregate advisory fees received from mutual funds advised by CMA and
Banc of America Capital Management, LLC ("BACAP") by $32 million per year for
five years as contemplated by the agreement in principle with the NYAG.

The Committee also considered the projected impact on expenses of these Funds
resulting from the overall cost reductions that management anticipated would
result from the proposed shift to a common group of service providers for
transfer agency, fund accounting and custody services for mutual funds advised
by Bank of America affiliates.

The Board also considered information in the Lipper report that ranked each Fund
based on (i) each Fund's one-year performance and actual management fees, (ii)
each Fund's one-year performance and total expenses and (iii) each Fund's 3-year
performance and total expenses. Based on these comparisons and expense and
performance rankings of the Fund in the Lipper Report, CMA determined an overall
score

- -----------
1    On February 9, 2005, CMA and its affiliate, Columbia Funds Distributor,
     Inc., entered into settlement agreements with the SEC and the NYAG that
     contain substantially the terms outlined in the agreements in principle.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)




for the Fund. The Committee and the Board also considered projected savings to
the Fund that would result from certain modifications in soft dollar
arrangements.

The Committee also considered more detailed information relating to certain
Funds that were highlighted for additional review based upon the fact that they
ranked poorly in terms of overall expense or management fees, maintained poor
performance or demonstrated a combination of below average to poor performance
while maintaining below average or poor expense rankings. At its September 23,
2004 meeting, the Committee discussed these Funds with management and in
executive session. The Committee requested additional information from
management regarding the cause(s) of the below-average relative performance of
these Funds, any remedial actions management recommended to improve performance
and the general standards for review of portfolio manager performance. At its
October 12, 2004 meeting, the Committee considered additional information
provided by management regarding these Funds. The Board also considered
management's proposal to merge or liquidate some of these Funds.

Based on these considerations and other factors, the Board concluded that the
overall performance and expense results supported by the approval of the
Advisory Agreements for each Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE RATES

The Board reviewed and considered the proposed contractual investment advisory
fee rates (the "Advisory Agreement Rates") payable by the Funds to CMA for
investment advisory services. In addition, the Board reviewed and considered the
existing and proposed fee waiver and reimbursement arrangements applicable to
the Advisory Agreement Rates and considered the Advisory Agreement Rates after
taking the fee waivers and reimbursements into account (the "Net Advisory
Rates"). At previous meetings, the Committee had separately considered
management's proposal to reduce annual investment advisory fees for certain
Funds under the NYAG agreement in principle and the impact of these reductions
on each affected Fund. Additionally, the Board considered information comparing
the Advisory Agreement Rates and Net Advisory Rates (both on a stand-alone basis
and on a combined basis with the Funds' administration fee rates) with those of
the other funds in the Expense Peer Group. The Board concluded that the Advisory
Agreement Rates and Net Advisory Rates represented reasonable compensation to
CMA, in light of the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the
Funds, the fees paid and expenses borne by comparable funds and the costs that
CMA incurs in providing these services to the Funds.

PROFITABILITY

The Board considered a detailed profitability analysis of CMA based on 2003
financial statements, adjusted to take into account advisory fee reductions
implemented in November 2003 and proposed reductions under the NYAG proposed
settlement. The Board concluded that, in light of the costs of providing
investment management and other services to the Funds, the profits and other
ancillary benefits that CMA and its affiliates received for providing these
services to the Funds were not unreasonable.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE

In evaluating potential economies of scale, the Board considered CMA's proposal
to implement a standardized breakpoint schedule for combined advisory and
administrative fees for the majority of the funds of the same general asset type
within the Columbia Funds complex (other than index and closed-end funds). The
Board noted that the standardization of the breakpoints would not result in a
fee increase for any Fund. The Board concluded that any actual or potential
economies of scale are, or will be, shared fairly with Fund shareholders,
including most particularly through Advisory Agreement Rate breakpoints at
current and reasonably foreseeable asset levels.

INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES TO OTHER CLIENTS

In evaluating the proposed fee reductions under the NYAG agreement in principle,
the Board considered information regarding the advisory fee rates charged by
BACAP for the Nations Funds. Members of the Committee and the Board had also
separately reviewed advisory fee rates for variable insurance product funds
advised by CMA. This information assisted the Board in assessing the
reasonableness of fees paid under the Advisory Agreements in light of the
nature, extent and quality of services provided under those agreements.

OTHER BENEFITS TO CMA

The Board considered information regarding potential "fall-out" or ancillary
benefits received by CMA and its affiliates as a result of their relationship
with the Funds. These benefits could include benefits directly attributable to
the relationship of CMA with the Funds (such as soft dollar credits) and
benefits potentially derived from an increase in the business of CMA as a result
of their relationship with the Funds (such as the ability to market to
shareholders other financial products offered by CMA and its affiliates).

OTHER FACTORS AND BROADER REVIEW

The Board reviews detailed materials provided by CMA annually as part of the
approval process under Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. The Board also regularly
reviews and assesses the quality of the services that the Funds receive
throughout the year. In this regard, the Board reviews information provided by
CMA at their regular meetings, including, among other things, a detailed
portfolio review, and detailed fund performance reports. In addition, the Board
interviews the heads of each investment area at each regular meeting of the
Board and selected portfolio managers of the Funds at various times throughout
the year. After considering the above-described factors and based on the
deliberations and their evaluation of the information provided to them, the
Board concluded that re-approval of the Advisory Agreements for each of the
Funds was in the best interest of the Funds and their shareholders. Accordingly,
the Board unanimously approved the Advisory Agreements.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have not been any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial

          this report, have concluded that such controls and procedures are
          adequately designed to ensure that information required to be
          disclosed by the registrant in Form N-CSR is accumulated and
          communicated to the registrant's management, including the principal
          executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
          performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
          regarding required disclosure.

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by

          this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to

          accounting principles;

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
