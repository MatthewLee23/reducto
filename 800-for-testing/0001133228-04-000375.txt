R. JAY GERKEN, CFA
Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholder,

After a four-year period of monetary easing, which saw the Federal Reserve Bank
("Fed") steer the key federal funds target rate(i) down to a four-decade low of
one percent, the central bank reversed course in late June to what many
observers believe will be a protracted period of monetary tightening or steering
short-term interest rates higher. Higher interest rates can act as a brake on
robust economic growth to help maintain a balance between steady growth and the
inflation that generally accompanies that growth.

The Fed's increase in the federal funds rate to 1.25% at the end of June was
widely anticipated. Bond yields, particularly those on longer-maturity issues,
began moving up earlier this year as bond prices declined. Yields continued
their ascent as it became more evident that the improving economy and higher
inflation would compel the Fed to act in June. In particular, evidence of
renewed job growth - the one missing piece from the economic recovery - drove
rates higher beginning in the spring.

Intermediate-term municipal bonds, particularly those with 7-to-10 year
maturities, succumbed to more pricing pressure than 15-to-20 year issues, but
all these maturity classes held up better than bonds with longer maturities in
excess of 22 years.(ii) However, as the fund's portfolio manager, Peter Coffey,
explained in past letters to fund shareholders, the fund remained defensively
positioned to hold up better than the municipal bond market in the event of a
rising rate environment. In terms of Net Asset Value ("NAV")(iii) performance,
while the portfolio manager's investment approach reduced the fund's full
participation in the bond market's upside moves when bond prices rose, it
contributed to the fund's NAV returns by diminishing the downward pricing
pressures on the fund when bond prices declined, particularly in April and much
of May. The fund's performance also was influenced by isolated issue- and
sector-specific factors. From a credit-quality perspective, the portfolio
manager maintained a conservative posture targeting bonds in a diverse cross
section of market segments.

Fund Performance

The Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. returned -6.57%, based on its American Stock
Exchange ("AMEX") market price and 0.44% based on its NAV per share during the
six-month period ended June 30, 2004. In comparison, the unmanaged, broad-based
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index,(iv) returned -0.68% and the fund's Lipper
general muni debt (leveraged) closed-end funds category average(v) was -1.26%
over the same time frame. Please note that Lipper performance returns are based
on each fund's NAV. Also, the funds in this Lipper category generally are not
restricted to intermediate-term municipal securities and may hold more
market-sensitive, longer-term bonds.

During this six-month period, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders
totaling $0.31 per share. The performance table shows the fund's 30-day SEC and
annualized distribution yields as well as its six-month total return based on
its NAV and market price as of June 30, 2004. Certain investors may be subject
to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"), and state and local taxes may
apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. Please consult with your tax or
legal advisor. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund's
yields will vary.

All figures represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.
The fund's yields will vary.

Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively. Total
returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional shares. Annualized distribution yield is
the fund's current monthly income dividend rate, annualized, and then divided by
the NAV or the market price noted in this report. The "SEC yield" is a return
figure often quoted by bond and other fixed-income mutual funds. This quotation
is based on the most recent 30-day (or one-month) period covered by the fund's
filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest
earned during the period after deduction of the fund's expenses for the period.
The annualized distribution yield assumes a current monthly income dividend rate
of $0.051 for 12 months. These yields are as of June 30, 2004 and are subject to
change.

================================================================================

Considering that short-term rates are still hovering near four-decade lows, the
portfolio manager believes that prudence dictates maintaining a conservative
posture in managing the fund's exposure to interest rate risk while focusing on
pursuing competitive yields.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees, and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests and
investigations.

In November 2003, Citigroup Asset Management disclosed an investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Attorney relating to
Citigroup Asset Management's entry into the transfer agency business during
1997-1999. On July 20, 2004, Citigroup disclosed that it had been notified by
the Staff of the SEC that the Staff is considering recommending a civil
injunctive action and/or an administrative proceeding against certain advisory
and transfer agent entities affiliated with Citigroup relating to the creation
and operation of its internal transfer agent unit to serve primarily the Smith
Barney family of mutual funds. This internal transfer agent did not provide
services to the fund. Citigroup is cooperating with the SEC and will seek to
resolve this matter in discussion with the SEC Staff. Although there can be no
assurance, Citigroup does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect on the fund.

The fund is traded under the symbol "SBI" and its closing market price is
available in most newspapers under the AMEX listings. The daily NAV is available
on-line under symbol XSBIX. Barron's and The Wall Street Journal's Monday
editions carry closed-end fund tables that will provide additional information.
In addition, the fund issues a quarterly press release that can be found on most
major financial websites as well as www.citigroupassetmanagement.com.

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of June 30, 2004 and are subject to
change and may not be representative of the portfolio manager's current or
future investments. Please refer to pages 6 through 14 for a list and percentage
breakdown of the fund's holdings.

All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. Please
note that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.

RISKS: Keep in mind the fund's investments are subject to interest rate and
credit risks. Lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds, known as "junk bonds", are
subject to greater credit risk, including the risk of default, than higher-rated
obligations. The fund may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which
can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially
large impact on fund performance.

As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the fund's share
price.

Dividends and yields fluctuate and are subject to change. Yields and dividends
represent past performance and there is no guarantee they will continue to be
paid. Please be advised that not all dividends declared by our funds will
qualify for lower tax rates under the recent tax law changes. Please consult
your tax or legal advisor.

U.S. Treasuries are direct debt obligations issued and backed by the "full faith
and credit" of the U.S. government. The principal and interest payments on U.S.
Treasuries are guaranteed by the U.S. government when the securities are held to
maturity.

(i)   The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks with excess
      reserves at a Federal Reserve district bank charge other banks that need
      overnight loans.
(ii)  Source: Based upon Lehman Brothers index performance data for each
      respective maturity category of municipal bonds.
(iii) NAV is calculated by subtracting total liabilities and outstanding
      preferred stock from the closing value of all securities held by the fund
      (plus all other assets) and dividing the result (total net assets) by the
      total number of the common shares outstanding. The NAV fluctuates with
      changes in the market prices of securities in which the fund has invested.
      However, the price at which an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund
      is at the fund's market price as determined by supply of and demand for
      the fund's shares.
(iv)  The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is a broad measure of the
      municipal bond market with maturities of at least one year.
(v)   Lipper is a major independent mutual fund tracking organization. Average
      annual returns are based on the six-month period ended June 30, 2004,

      closed-end funds category with reinvestment of dividends and capital
      gains.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!

As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your dividends
and capital gains distributions, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below
is a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary

If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of common stock shares in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a cash
dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share ("NAV") on the
determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a price reflecting
the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than the NAV at the time of valuation (the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent") will buy common
stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95% of
the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will be
based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open
market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in the section of this
report beginning on page 28. To find out more detailed information about the
Plan and about how you can participate, please call PFPC Inc. at (800) 331-1710.

Bond Ratings (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

AAA        -- Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
              Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
              strong.
AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
              repay principal and differs from the highest rated issue only in a
              small degree.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
              principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
              effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
              debt in higher rated categories.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
              pay interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits
              adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
              changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
              capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this
              category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B      -- Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on balance, as
CCC and CC    predominantly speculative and with respect to capacity to pay
              interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the
              obligation. "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation than
              "B", and "CC" the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds
              will likely have some quality and protective characteristics,
              these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk
              exposures to adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 may be
applied to each generic rating from "Aa" to "Caa", where 1 is the highest and 3
the lowest rating within its generic category.

Aaa        -- Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
              the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
              to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or
              by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While
              the various protective elements are likely to change, such changes
              as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
              strong position of such issues.
Aa         -- Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all
              standards. Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are
              generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the
              best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in
              "Aaa" securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of
              greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which
              make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa"
              securities.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and
              are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
              giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate
              but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to
              impairment some time in the future.
Baa        -- Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations,
              i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
              Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the
              present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
              characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
              bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
              speculative characteristics as well.
Ba         -- Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
              future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
              of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and
              therefore not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over
              the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this
              class.
B          -- Bonds rated "B" generally lack characteristics of the desirable
              investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or
              maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of
              time may be small.
Caa        -- Bonds rated "Caa" are of poor standing. These issues may be in
              default, or there may be present elements of danger with respect
              to principal or interest.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bond Ratings (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ca         -- Bonds rated "Ca" represent obligations which are speculative in a
              high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked
              shortcomings.
C          -- Bonds rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
              rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever
              attaining any real investment standing.

Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") -- Ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus (+) sign or minus (-) sign to show relative standings within
the major ratings categories.

AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" are considered to be investment-grade and of very
              high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and/or
              dividends and repay principal is very strong.
A          -- Bonds and preferred stock considered to be investment-grade and of
              high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and/or
              dividends and repay principal is considered to be strong, but may
              be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
              circumstances than debt or preferred securities with higher
              ratings.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are considered to be investment-grade and of
              satisfactory credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest
              or dividends and repay principal is considered to be adequate.
              Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however,
              are more likely to have adverse impact on these securities and,
              therefore, impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings
              of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for
              securities with higher ratings.

NR         -- Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's, Moody's
              or Fitch.

Short-Term Security Ratings (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SP-1       -- Standard & Poor's highest rating indicating very strong or strong
              capacity to pay principal and interest; those issues determined to
              possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a
              plus (+) sign.
A-1        -- Standard & Poor's highest commercial paper and variable-rate
              demand obligation ("VRDO") rating indicating that the degree of
              safety regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very
              strong; those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
              characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign.
VMIG 1     -- Moody's highest rating for issues having a demand feature -- VRDO.

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company.

The following are significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"):(a) security transactions are accounted for on trade date;(b)
securities are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices provided by
an independent pricing service that are based on transactions in municipal
obligations, quotations from municipal bond dealers, market transactions in
comparable securities and various relationships between securities; (c)
securities for which market quotations are not available will be valued in good
faith at fair value by or under the direction of the Board of Directors; (d)
securities maturing within 60 days are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or
minus amortized premium, which approximates value; (e) gains or losses on the
sale of securities are calculated by using the specific identification method;
(f) interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount, is recorded on an accrual basis; (g) dividends and distributions to
shareholders are recorded monthly by the Fund on the ex-dividend date for the
shareholders of Common Stock based on net investment income. The holders of the
Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
dividends in accordance with an auction that will normally be held weekly and
out of funds legally available to shareholders; (h) the character of income and
gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations
which may differ from GAAP; (i) the Fund intends to comply with the applicable
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to
regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income
sufficient to relieve it from substantially all Federal income and excise taxes;
(j) the net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock is determined by dividing the
value of the net assets available to Common Stock by the total number of shares
of common stock outstanding. For the purpose of determining the net asset value
per share of the common stock, the value of the Fund's net assets shall be
deemed to equal the value of the Fund's assets less (1) the Fund's
liabilities,(2) the aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000 per outstanding
share) of the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock and (3)
accumulated and unpaid dividends on the outstanding Municipal Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock issue; and (k) estimates and assumptions are required
to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets resulting
from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the economic
environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

2. Exempt-Interest Dividends and Other Distributions

The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from municipal
securities, which is exempt from Federal income tax and from designated state
income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to the
shareholders of the Fund.

Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders, and are
declared and paid at least annually.

3. Management Agreement and Transactions with Affiliated Persons

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager to the Fund. As
compensation for its services, the Fund pays SBFM a management fee calculated at
an annual rate of 0.60% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For purposes of
calculating the management fee, the liquidation value of any preferred stock of
the Fund is not deducted in determining the Fund's average daily net assets.
This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

4. Investments

During the six months ended June 30, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

================================================================================
Purchases                                                            $27,218,530
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sales                                                                 26,018,241
================================================================================

At June 30, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation
of investments for Federal income tax purposes were substantially as follows:

================================================================================
Gross unrealized appreciation                                       $ 6,695,209
Gross unrealized depreciation                                        (2,290,360)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                         $ 4,404,849
================================================================================

5. Futures Contracts

Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited with
the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contracts. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the

value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by "marking
to market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of the contract at the
end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are received or made and
recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to broker, depending upon
whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When the contract is closed,
the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the
proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and the Fund's basis in the
contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically to hedge a portion of
its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the
value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

At June 30, 2004, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

==========================================================================================================
</TABLE>

6. Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock

On January 28, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Series M Municipal Auction
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("ARCPS"). The underwriting discount of $500,000
and offering expenses of $278,731 associated with the ARCPS offering were
recorded as a reduction of the capital paid in excess of par value of common
stock for the year ended December 31, 2002. The ARCPS' dividends are cumulative
at a rate determined at an auction and the dividend period is typically 7 days.
The dividend rates ranged from 0.80% to 1.16% during the six months ended June
30, 2004. At June 30, 2004, the dividend rate was 1.16%.

The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference, which
is the sum of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.
Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset coverage requirements would
restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common shareholders.

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM") another indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup, also currently acts as a broker/dealer in connection with the
auction of ARCPS. After each auction, the auction agent will pay to each
broker/dealer, from monies the Fund provides, a participation fee at the annual
rate of 0.25% of the purchase price of the ARCPS that the broker/dealer places
at the auction. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, CGM earned $62,401 as a
participating broker/dealer.

7. Additional Information

Citigroup has been notified by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that the Staff is considering recommending a civil injunctive
action and/or an administrative proceeding against Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), including its applicable investment advisory companies and Citicorp
Trust Bank ("CTB"), an internal transfer agent, relating to the creation and
operation of the internal transfer agent unit to serve certain CAM-managed
funds. CTB did not provide services to the Fund. This notification arises out of
a previously disclosed investigation by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney and
relates to CTB's entry in 1999 into the transfer agency business, CAM's
retention of, and agreements with an unaffiliated sub transfer agent, the
adequacy of the disclosures made to the fund boards that approved the transfer
agency arrangements, (including CAM's failure to disclose a related revenue
guarantee agreement benefiting CAM and its affiliates), and CAM's operation of
and compensation for the transfer agency business. The revenue guarantee
described above was terminated in 1999 and CAM will be paying the applicable
funds, primarily through fee waivers, a total of approximately $17 million (plus
interest) that is the amount of the revenue received by Citigroup relating to
the revenue guarantee. The Fund did not implement the contractual arrangement
described above and therefore will not receive any portion of the payment.
Citigroup is cooperating fully in the investigation and will seek to resolve the
matter in discussions with the SEC Staff. Although there can be no assurance,
Citigroup does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
on the Fund.

      assets would have been 5.31%. Per share information, ratios and
      supplemental data for the periods prior to January 1, 2001 have not been
      restated to reflect this change in presentation. In addition, the impact
      of this change to net investment income and net realized and unrealized
      gain was less than $0.01 per share.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose shares
of common stock are registered in his own name will have all distributions from
the fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as purchasing agent
under the plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. Distributions
with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer or other
nominee (that is, in street name) will be reinvested by the broker or nominee in
additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the
broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash.
Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult their
broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of First Data as
dividend paying agent.

The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the plan in
lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the market
price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share
of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the record date for
the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of common stock by
the fund at a price equal to the greater of net asset value determined as
described below under "Net Asset Value" or 95% of the market price of the common
stock.

If the market price of the common stock is less than the net asset value of the
common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of business on the
determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open market, on the AMEX
or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following the commencement of
the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases, the market price
exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the valuation time, PFPC
will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and cause the fund to
issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution in shares at a price
equal to the greater of (a) net asset value as of the valuation time or (b) 95%
of the then current market price. In this case, the number of shares received by
a Plan participant will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for
shares purchased in the open market and the price at which the fund issues the
remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is unable to stop open market purchases and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining shares, the average per share purchase
price paid by PFPC may exceed the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or capital gains distribution had been paid in common stock issued by
the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC will begin to purchase common stock on
the open market as soon as practicable after the determination date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution, but in no event

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shall such purchases continue later than 30 days after the payment date for such
dividend or distribution, or the record date for a succeeding dividend or
distribution, except when necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the
federal securities laws.

PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each plan participant will be held
by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the plan participant.

Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and capital
gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the fund. No brokerage
charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the fund
under the Plan. Each plan participant will, however, bear a proportionate share
of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with respect to any open market
purchases made under the plan.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts
02266-8030 or by telephone at (800) 331-1710.

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
      information included in this report, fairly present in all material
      respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

      include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
      registrant and have:

      a)    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known

            registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
            fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of

      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial information included in this report,
      and the financial statements on which the financial information is based,
      fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
      of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows (if the financial
      statements are required to include a statement of cash flows) of the
      registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the
      registrant and have:

      a)    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
            to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared;

      b)    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
            and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
            the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

      c)    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
            control over financial reporting that occurred during the
            registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
            fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and

      b)    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
