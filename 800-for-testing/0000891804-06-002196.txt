PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S
        COMMENTS


Portfolio manager Tom Spalding reviews key investment strategies and the
six-month performance of these six Funds. With 29 years of investment experience
at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ since its inception in 2001 and NPP, NMA, NMO,
NAD, and NZF since 2003.



WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
APRIL 30, 2006?

During this reporting period, we saw a general increase in interest rates,
although rates at the longer end of the yield curve remained more stable than
those at the short end throughout much of the period. Between November 1, 2005
and April 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve implemented four increases of 0.25% each
in the fed funds rate, raising this short-term target by 100 basis points--from
3.75% to 4.75%. (On May 10, 2006, the fed funds rate was increased by another 25
basis points to 5%, marking the Fed's 16th consecutive quarter-point hike since
June 2004.) In contrast, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
ended April 2006 at 5.06%, up from 4.55% six months earlier, while the yield on
the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index, a widely followed measure of longer-term
municipal market rates, was 5.22% at the end of April 2006, an increase of just
two basis points from the beginning of November 2005. As interest rates
increased, bond valuations generally declined, and the yield curve flattened as
short-term rates approached the levels of longer-term rates.

In this environment, one of our key strategies continued to be careful duration1
management, part of which included efforts to more closely align the duration
and yield curve positioning of these Funds. Depending on the needs of the
individual Fund, our purchase activity focused on attractively priced bonds
maturing in 10 to 15 years in Funds that were close to their duration target and
in 20 years and longer in Funds where the duration needed lengthening. As the
yield curve continued to flatten, we believed that bonds in these parts of the
curve generally offered better value and reward opportunities more commensurate
with their risk levels. As the period progressed, we started to see more
opportunities to add value at the longer end of the curve, and we began to
slightly extend the Funds' durations.

In looking for potential purchase candidates, we kept an opportunistic eye
toward all types of issuance that we believed could add value to the Funds'
portfolios and keep the Funds well diversified geographically. Overall,
portfolio activity was relatively light during this period. This was due in part
to the fact that these Funds entered the reporting period fully invested and
with routine call exposure. Another factor was the 5.5% decline in municipal
supply during this six-month period compared with the same period 12 months
earlier (November 2004-April 2005). The decrease in supply was even more evident



1    Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
     change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
     changes than bonds with shorter durations.


                                       4

during the first four months of 2006, when new issuance dropped almost 25% from
the levels of January-April 2005. At the same time, demand for municipal bonds
continued to be diverse and broad-based, with retail investors, property and
casualty insurance companies, and third-party investors--such as hedge funds and
arbitrage accounts--all participating in the market.

In general, much of the new supply was highly rated and/or insured, and the
majority of our new purchases during this time were higher-rated credits. While
we continued to emphasize maintaining the Funds' weightings of bonds rated BBB
or lower and nonrated bonds, tighter supply and declining relative valuations
meant fewer opportunities to find additional lower-rated issues that we believed
represented value for shareholders. One of the few lower quality areas where we
did find opportunities to add value was the tobacco sector, and we purchased
selected tobacco issues to maintain our portfolios' overall exposure to this
sector.

2    The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged
     national index comprising a broad range of investment-grade municipal
     bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

3    The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds category average is
     calculated using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in
     this category for each period as follows: 6 months, 56; 1 year, 56; 5
     years, 45; and 10 years, 39. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of
     dividends.


                                       5

<PAGE>

For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the cumulative returns on net asset
value (NAV) for all six of the Funds in this report exceeded or performed in
line with the return on their Lehman Brothers municipal benchmark. NXZ also
slightly outperformed the average return for the Funds' Lipper peer group for
this period, NZF slightly underperformed the peer group, while NPP, NMA, NMO,
and NAD underperformed this average.

One of the factors that, on balance, benefited the six-month performance of
these Funds relative to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index was the Funds' use of financial leverage. While leveraging can add
volatility to a Fund's NAV and share price, this strategy can also provide
opportunities for additional income and total return for common shareholders.
The benefits of leveraging are tied in part to the short-term rates leveraged
Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders. During periods of low short-term
rates, leveraged Funds generally pay lower dividends to their MuniPreferred
shareholders, which can leave more earnings to support common share dividends.
Conversely, when short-term interest rates rise, as they did during this
reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise, which can impact the
Funds' income streams and total returns. However, as long as short-term yields
are lower than those of the long-term bonds in the Funds' portfolios, the income
received by the common shareholders of leveraged Funds will be higher than it
would be if the Funds were unleveraged. Despite the impact of rising interest
rates on bond valuations, the extra income, or yield advantage, resulting from
leveraging during this period remained strong enough to help the Funds' total
returns outperform or perform in line with the return on the Lehman index for
this six months. Over the long term, we believe the use of financial leverage
will continue to work to the benefit of the Funds, as demonstrated by the
five-year and ten-year return performances--both absolute and relative--of the
Funds in this report.

During this reporting period, positive contributors to the Funds' returns
included yield curve and duration positioning, exposure to lower-rated credits,
and pre-refunding activity.

As the yield curve continued to flatten over the course of this period, yield
curve and duration positioning played important roles in the Funds'
performances. On the whole, shorter maturity bonds were the most impacted by
recent changes in the yield curve. As a result, these bonds generally
underperformed both intermediate and long bonds, with credits having the longest
durations posting the best returns for this period. Yield curve positioning or,
more specifically, greater exposure to those parts of the yield curve that
performed well helped the performances of these Funds during this period. As
previously mentioned, we continued to work to more closely align the yield curve
positioning of all of these Funds.

With bonds rated BBB or lower and nonrated bonds generally outperforming other
credit quality sectors during this period, all of these Funds benefited from
their allocations of lower-quality credits. The performance of this sector was
largely the result of investor


                                       6

<PAGE>

demand for the higher yields typically associated with lower-quality bonds,
which drove up their value and kept credit spreads narrow. As of April 30, 2006,
allocations of bonds rated BBB or lower and nonrated bonds accounted for 11% of
NMO's portfolio, 13% of NPP, 13% of NZF, 16% of NAD, 19% of NMA, and 21% of NXZ.
As Dividend Advantage Funds, NAD, NXZ, and NZF can also invest a higher portion
of their portfolios in bonds rated BB or lower, and NXZ's allocation of 8% to
this category gave a boost to its six-month performance.

Among the lower-rated holdings making contributions to the Funds' cumulative
returns for this period were health care bonds (including hospitals) and tobacco
credits backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement agreement. As mentioned
earlier, we continued to purchase uninsured tobacco bonds during this period.

We also continued to see a number of advance refundings4 during this period,
which benefited the Funds through price appreciation and enhanced credit
quality. However, as the yield curve flattened, more lower coupon bonds were
being pre-refunded, which meant that, in general, the positive impact from
refinancings was less than in the previous reporting period.

While advance refundings generally enhanced total return performance for this
six-month period, the rising interest rate environment--especially at the short
end of the yield curve--meant that the Funds' holdings of older, previously
pre-refunded bonds tended to underperform the general municipal market, due
primarily to the shorter effective maturities of these bonds. This was
especially true in the four older Funds--NPP, NMA, NMO, and NAD--which had
significantly larger allocations of pre-refunded bonds than the more recently
established NXZ and NZF.


HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
APRIL 30, 2006?

We continued to believe that maintaining strong credit quality was an important
requirement. As of April 30, 2006, all six of these Funds continued to offer
excellent credit quality, with allocations of bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed
and AA ranging from 68% in NXZ to 79% in NMA to 82% in NAD, 83% in NPP, 84% in
NMO, and 85% in NZF.

As of April 30, 2006, potential call exposure for the period May 2006 through
the end of 2007 ranged from 7% in NXZ, 8% in NMO, and 10% in NZF to 17% in NAD
and NPP and 18% in NMA. We continued to watch the market for opportunities to
reinvest proceeds from bonds with shorter call dates into bonds with maturities
of at least 15 years. The number of actual bond calls in all of these Funds
depends largely on future market interest rates.


4    Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur
     when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
     interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
     lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

Dividend and Share Price
       INFORMATION


As previously noted, all of the Funds in this report use leverage to potentially
enhance opportunities for additional income for common shareholders. During
periods of rising short-term interest rates, as was the case during this
reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise, reducing the extent of
the benefits of leveraging. This resulted in one monthly dividend reduction in
NPP, NMA, NMO, and NXZ and two in NAD over the six-month period ended April 30,
2006. The dividend of NZF remained stable throughout this reporting period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of the following Funds received capital gains and net ordinary income
distributions at the end of December 2005, as follows:


             LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS                    ORDINARY INCOME

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NMA                          $0.0116                            $0.0030

NMO                               --                            $0.0036
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2006, all of the
Funds in this report had a positive UNII balance for financial statement
purposes and a positive UNII balance, based upon our best estimate, for tax
purposes.

At the end of the reporting period, the Funds' share prices were trading at
premiums or discounts to their NAVs as shown in the accompanying chart:

1    Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

1    Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

1    Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                         unless otherwise noted.

                    (2)  Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and
                         prices of the earliest optional call or redemption.
                         There may be other call provisions at varying prices at
                         later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may be
                         subject to periodic principal paydowns.

                    (3)  Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or
                         Moody's rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's
                         Group or Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. are
                         considered to be below investment grade.

                         Government or U.S. Government agency securities which
                         ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.
                         Such investments are normally considered to be
                         equivalent to AAA rated securities.

                    (5)  Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but
                         has variable rate and demand features which qualify it
                         as a short-term investment. The rate disclosed that in
                         effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
                         changes periodically based on market conditions or a
                         specified market index.

                    (6)  Non-income producing.

                    (7)  On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation ("UAL"), the
                         holding company of United Air Lines, Inc. filed for
                         federal bankruptcy protection. The Adviser determined
                         that it was likely that United would not remain current
                         on their interest payment obligations with respect to
                         the bonds previously held and thus the Fund had stopped
                         accruing interest on its UAL bonds.

                    (8)  On February 1, 2006, UAL emerged from federal
                         bankruptcy with the acceptance of its reorganization
                         plan by the bankruptcy court. Under the settle
                         agreement established to meet UAL's unsecured bond
                         obligations, the bondholders, including the Fund,
                         received a distribution of UAL common stock during the
                         subsequent month, and the bankruptcy court dismissed
                         all unsecured claims of bondholders, including those of
                         the Fund. Subsequent to fiscal year-end, the Fund
                         liquidated its UAL common stock holdings.

                    (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments
                         are based on net assets applicable to Common shares
                         unless otherwise noted.

                    (2)  Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and
                         prices of the earliest optional call or redemption.
                         There may be other call provisions at varying prices at
                         later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may be
                         subject to periodic principal paydowns.

                    (3)  Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or
                         Moody's rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's
                         Group or Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. are
                         considered to be below investment grade.

                    (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                         Government or U.S. Government agency securities which
                         ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.
                         Such investments are normally considered to be
                         equivalent to AAA rated securities.

                    (5)  Non-income producing.

                    (6)  On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation ("UAL"), the
                         holding company of United Air Lines, Inc. filed for
                         federal bankruptcy protection. The Adviser determined
                         that it was likely that United would not remain current
                         on their interest payment obligations with respect to
                         the bonds previously held and thus the Fund had stopped
                         accruing interest on its UAL bonds.

                    (7)  On February 1, 2006, UAL emerged from federal
                         bankruptcy with the acceptance of its reorganization
                         plan by the bankruptcy court. Under the settle
                         agreement established to meet UAL's unsecured bond
                         obligations, the bondholders, including the Fund,
                         received a distribution of UAL common stock during the
                         subsequent month, and the bankruptcy court dismissed
                         all unsecured claims of bondholders, including those of
                         the Fund. Subsequent to fiscal year-end, the Fund
                         liquidated its UAL common stock holdings.

                    N/R  Not rated.

                    (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments
                         are based on net assets applicable to Common shares
                         unless otherwise noted.

                    (2)  Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and
                         prices of the earliest optional call or redemption.
                         There may be other call provisions at varying prices at
                         later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may be
                         subject to periodic principal paydowns.

                    (3)  Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or
                         Moody's rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's
                         Group or Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. are
                         considered to be below investment grade.

                    (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                         Government or U.S. Government agency securities which
                         ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.
                         Such investments are normally considered to be
                         equivalent to AAA rated securities.

                    (5)  On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation ("UAL"), the
                         holding company of United Air Lines, Inc. filed for
                         federal bankruptcy protection. The Adviser determined
                         that it was likely that United would not remain current
                         on their interest payment obligations with respect to
                         the bonds previously held and thus the Fund had stopped
                         accruing interest on its UAL bonds.

                    N/R  Not rated.

                  (ETM)  Escrowed to maturity.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

Notes to
           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)








1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation
The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based
on yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of derivative investments are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or derivative
investment, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment are unavailable or
inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,
may establish a fair value for the investment. Exchange-listed securities are
generally valued at the last sales price on the securities exchange on which
such securities are primarily traded. Securities traded on a securities exchange
for which there are no transactions on a given day or securities not listed on a
securities exchange are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices.
Securities traded on Nasdaq are valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price.
Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate and demand features
qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may have
extended settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2006,
Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA) and Dividend Advantage (NAD)
had outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments of $4,387,800,
$11,609,010 and $4,387,800, respectively. There were no such outstanding
purchase commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income
Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any. Dividend
income, if any, is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Professional Fees
Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations, audit fees, tax consulting fees
and, in some cases, workout expenditures. Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an investment, or to pursue other claims or
legal actions on behalf of Fund shareholders.

Federal Income Taxes
Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain
such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. Net
realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by the Funds are
subject to federal taxation.



                                       76


<PAGE>

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares
The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

Forward Swap Transactions
The Funds are authorized to invest in certain derivative financial instruments.
The Funds' use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to
mitigate the negative impact that an increase in long-term interest rates could
have on Common share net asset value. Forward interest rate swap transactions
involve each Fund's agreement with the counterparty to pay, in the future, a
fixed rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable
rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the
future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on
the notional amount of the forward swap contract, and would increase or decrease
in value based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swaps' termination date were to increase or
decrease. The Funds may close out a contract prior to the effective date, at
which point a realized gain or loss would be recognized. When a forward swap is
terminated, it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other
underlying assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis.
Each Fund intends, but is not obligated to, terminate its forward swaps before
the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap
counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with
a counterparty failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the
Fund upon termination. To minimize such credit risk, all counterparties are
required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap)
on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any
unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any of the
Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have instructed the
custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately
equal to the amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold.
Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap
valuations fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold
amount. At April 30, 2006, the Funds did not have any forward swap contracts
outstanding.

Custodian Fee Credit
Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Indemnifications
Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by Nuveen
Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount
of assets within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen
fund shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual
fund as well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the
Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

(1)  The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
     calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
     the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
     all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
     in the U.S.

(2)  With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
     rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
     date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
     billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
     be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
     fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
     time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to their Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with the
Adviser or to their Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Dividend Advantage's (NAD) operations, the Adviser
has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net assets

REINVEST AUTOMATICALLY
         EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY




NUVEEN EXCHANGE-TRADED CLOSED-END FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Exchange-Traded Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT
To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED
The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE
You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

MODIFIED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over which a
bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a measure of the
sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when market interest
rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration, the more the
price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.


TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

consent of the person(s) to be nominated.

          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
          of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or
          is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
