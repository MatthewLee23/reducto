                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

The Advisor may also periodically provide additional information on Fund
performance on the Fund's webpage at http://www.ftportfolios.com.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment in
the Fund. It includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that
provide insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The material risks of investing in the
Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information,
this report and other Fund regulatory filings.

SHAREHOLDER LETTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                    ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                                  MAY 31, 2016


Dear Shareholders:

Thank you for your investment in First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
(the "Fund").

First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") is pleased to provide you with the
annual report which contains detailed information about your investment for the
twelve months ended May 31, 2016, including a market overview and a performance
analysis for the period. We encourage you to read this report and discuss it
with your financial advisor.

While markets were up and down during 2015, we believe there are three important
things to remember. First, the U.S. economy grew, despite the massive decline in
oil prices. Second, the tapering that began in 2014 by the Federal Reserve (the
"Fed") did not stop growth in the U.S. economy. Finally, the long-anticipated
rate hike by the Fed in December had little effect on the money supply, and the
stock market was not shocked by the hike. Early in 2016, many investors were
concerned that the volatility we saw in the market in 2015 would continue, and
it did. From December 31, 2015 through February 11, 2016, the S&P 500(R) Index
declined by 10.27%. Since then, the market has made a steady comeback, and as of
May 31, 2016, the S&P 500(R) Index was up 15.43%.

First Trust believes that having a long-term investment horizon and being
invested in quality products can help you reach your goals, regardless of how
the market behaves. We have always maintained perspective about the markets and
believe investors should as well. We will continue to strive to provide quality
investment opportunities each and every day, which has been one of the hallmarks
of our firm since its inception 25 years ago.

Thank you for giving First Trust the opportunity to be a part of your investment
plan. We value our relationship with you and will continue to focus on helping
investors like you reach your financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of floating-rate loan interests
("senior loans"). There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment
objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

The last 12 months proved to be challenging for the senior loan market, which
began with nine straight months of negative returns, followed by three strong
months of positive returns to finish the trailing twelve months in modestly
positive territory. The last 12 months' total return for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged
Loan Index ("senior loan index") was 0.49%. This compares to -0.88% for the BofA
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Constrained Index ("high-yield bond index") and
1.72% for the S&P 500(R) Index over the same time period. The negative returns
experienced during the first nine months of the last 12 month period were driven
in part by what we believed to be a decoupling of market prices from
fundamentals. We observed that any hint of negative news for a given company or
industry in the non-investment grade markets (i.e. senior loans and high-yield
bonds) would lead to significant market price volatility. This price action was
warranted in some specific instances, but generally speaking, was in excess of
what we would have expected. Moreover, the inconsistent rhetoric from the U.S.
Federal Reserve (the "Fed") in the latter half of 2015 and the eventual start to
a new rate hike cycle contributed to overall instability in the broader
financial markets.

The start of 2016 proved to be quite eventful in the capital markets, as equity
market volatility early in the first quarter instilled fear in investors that
the U.S. economy might be slowing and led some to speculate that the U.S.
economy might be heading into a recession. On February 11, 2016, the low-point
for financial markets during 2016, the high-yield bond index was off 5.14% and
the senior loan index was off 1.36% year-to-date, according to Bloomberg. This
compared to the S&P 500(R) Index which was down 10.27% for the same period.
However, as the equity markets bottomed and reversed course, the credit markets
also rebounded and by the end of May 2016, the high-yield bond index and senior
loan index total returns from the trough on February 11th were 14.01% and 5.93%,
respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500(R) Index rallied 15.43% during that
same time period. Despite the increased volatility the high-yield index and
senior loan index total return for the 2016 year-to-date period through May 31,
2016 were 8.15% and 4.49%, respectively. The S&P 500(R) Index total return was
3.57% for the same time period.

SENIOR LOAN MARKET

The senior loan index returned 0.49% for the twelve-month period ending May 31,
2016. From a credit quality perspective the returns were mixed. Lower quality
CCC rated issues returned -2.97% in the period, underperforming the returns of
higher quality B rated issues at 0.51% and BB rated issues at 2.59%. The average
bid price of loans in the market began the period at $97.39 and, after bottoming
at $89.44 at the end of February, loan prices ended the period at $93.41. The
discounted spread to a 3-year life for the senior loan index began the period at
499 basis points above LIBOR ("L+499"), widened to L+775 at the end of February
and ended the period at L+573.(1)

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                 ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2016


CREDIT QUALITY/DEFAULT RATES

Default rates continue to remain below the long term average for senior loans.
The default rate over the last 12 months in the senior loan index was 1.96%. The
long-term average default rate dating back to January 1999 is 3.13%. We believe
the default rate remains below the long-term average because overall corporate
fundamentals remain healthy, as evidenced by the fact that senior loan issuers,
that file their financial results publicly, have grown cash flows for 27
straight quarters through March 31, 2016. Despite the strength of cash flow
growth, the lack of near-term debt maturities, and favorable access to capital
markets, we believe the default rate for both senior loans and high-yield bonds
will drift higher in 2016 but the majority of defaults will be in sectors that
are exposed to volatile commodity prices and not systemic to the overall market.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund outperformed the senior loan index on a net asset value (NAV) basis for
the trailing twelve-month period. The Fund generated a NAV return of 2.36% and a
market price return of 1.56% while the senior loan index generated a total
return of 0.49%. The Fund's discount to NAV ended the period 60 basis points
wider than one year ago. At the start of the period, the Fund's market price was
at a 6.39% discount to NAV and widened to a 6.99% discount to NAV by the end of
the period.

Contributing to the Fund's outperformance relative to the senior loan index over
the period was the Fund's use of leverage and issuer selection. The use of
leverage contributed positively as the total return of senior loans exceeded the
borrowing cost of leverage. Leverage at the end of May 2016 was approximately
26.8% of managed assets.

From an income perspective, the monthly announced distribution rate began the
period at $0.072 per share and ended at $0.070 per share. The driver behind the
distribution rate decline was the portfolio managers' decision to reduce overall
leverage in the Fund in reaction to the increased credit market volatility
prevalent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and into the first half of
the first quarter of 2016. As the markets became more volatile, the Fund's
portfolio managers believed it was prudent to reduce leverage by approximately
2.00%. At the $0.070 per share monthly distribution rate, the annualized
distribution rate at the end of May 2016 was 5.99% at NAV and 6.44% at market
price.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

Credit markets appear well positioned for the intermediate term. We believe the
combination of strong technical tailwinds created by global central bank policy,
attractive valuations within the credit markets, a below-average default rate
environment, modest but healthy economic growth and sound corporate fundamentals
provide a firm backdrop for returns in the periods ahead. However, we believe
that the volatility that we have experienced since the second half of 2015 may
continue to persist throughout 2016. We believe that this volatility has and
should lead to some compelling valuations and opportunities in the U.S.
high-yield bond and senior bank loan markets. With that said, we believe credit
selection will be paramount to driving strong returns over the remainder of the
economic cycle. In the early years of the economic recovery, returns came
relatively easily. We believe returns can still be healthy for this portion of
the cycle, however, they will be harder to come by, accompanied by greater
volatility in the markets.

Based on current valuations (average price of $93.41 and spread of L+573(1)), we
believe senior loans, given their senior secured position in the capital
structure, floating interest rate, high income and limited commodity exposure
(energy, metals and mining only comprise 3.84% of the senior loan benchmark on a
market value basis), are well positioned to deliver attractive risk adjusted
returns. Retail investors have continued to reduce exposure to senior loans in
the wake of declining Treasury yields and continued dovish Fed rhetoric. We
believe that with further increases in the Federal Funds rate on the horizon,
even if they occur at a modest pace, investors in senior loans are likely to
benefit. We believe there remains a substantial asymmetry in the risk vs. reward
equation for long-duration fixed-income securities (those with the most rate
sensitivity). As a result, even modestly increasing interest rates can present
challenges for traditional fixed-income investors.

In summary, we believe that both the high-yield bond and senior loan markets
currently offer compelling opportunities, and specifically within actively
managed strategies where return opportunities can be realized and risk can be
appropriately managed. In a market where equity volatility is high, investors
may benefit from moving up the corporate capital structure into high-yield bonds
and senior loans to take advantage of the attractive valuations and lower
volatility.

As we evaluate new investment opportunities, decisions will continue to be
rooted in our rigorous bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the opportunities
that we believe offer the best risk and reward balance. Despite the many
distractions that ebb and flow every quarter, we remain firmly focused on
finding value in the high-yield bond and senior loan markets.

-----------------------------

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
      prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
      certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
      floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
      reflects the rate in effect at May 31, 2016. When a range of rates is
      disclosed, the Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche
      at varying rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   This issuer has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(e)   This issuer is in default but interest is still being accrued by the Fund
      and paid by the issuer.

(f)   On December 21, 2015, Millennium Health, LLC completed a Bankruptcy Plan
      of Reorganization. As part of the Bankruptcy Plan of Reorganization, the
      holders of Millennium Laboratories LLC, Tranche B Term Loan received a
      portion of a new term loan and a pro rata share of the newly issued common
      equity shares in New Millennium Holdco, Inc., the new company. Each lender
      was also issued a beneficial interest in the Corporate Claim Trust
      entitling it, as holder of such beneficial interest, to receive Corporate
      Claim Trust Distributions when and if net cash proceeds from the pursuit
      of Retained Corporate Causes of Action are available to make such a
      distribution. In addition, each lender was issued a beneficial interest in
      the Lender Claim Trust entitling it, as holder of such beneficial
      interest, to receive Lender Claim Trust Distributions when and if net cash
      proceeds from the pursuit of Retained Lender Causes of Action are
      available to make such a distribution.

(g)   Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this
      security has been determined to be illiquid by First Trust Advisors L.P.
      (the "Advisor").

(h)   Delayed Draw Loan (see Note 2C - Unfunded Loan Commitments in the Notes to
      Financial Statements).

(i)   Represents commitment fee rate on unfunded loan commitment. The commitment
      fee rate steps up at predetermined time intervals.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)
MAY 31, 2016


(j)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and may be resold in
      transactions exempt from registration, normally to qualified institutional
      buyers. Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
      this security has been determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although
      market instability can result in periods of increased overall market
      illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on
      security-specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective
      judgment. At May 31, 2016, securities noted as such amounted to $3,414,625
      or 0.9% of net assets.

(k)   Non-income producing security.

(l)   Security received in a transaction exempt from registration under the 1933
      Act. The security may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration
      under the 1933 Act, typically to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant
      to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has
      been determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although market instability
      can result in periods of increased overall market illiquidity, liquidity
      for the security is determined based on security-specific factors and
      assumptions, which require subjective judgment. At May 31, 2016, security
      noted as such amounted to $72,585 or 0.0% of net assets.

(m)   This security is fair valued by the Pricing Committee of the Advisor in
      accordance with procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in
      accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
      amended. At May 31, 2016, investments noted as such are valued at $0 or
      0.0% of net assets.

(n)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior to registration,
      restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes to
      Financial Statements).

(o)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $524,729,991. As of May
      31, 2016, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,079,077 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $19,577,820.

*     See the Portfolio of Investments for the industry breakout. Industry
      categories are only shown separately if they include holdings in two or
      more levels or have holdings in only Level 3.

**    Investment is valued at $0.

All transfers in and out of the Levels during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. As of May 31,
2016, the Fund transferred Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests valued at
$2,528,145 from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Senior
Floating-Rate Loan Interests that transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 did so
primarily as a result of a change in information obtained from an independent
third-party pricing service relating to the market activity of individual Senior
Floating-Rate Loan Interests and a lack of trading activity in certain Senior
Floating-Rate Loan Interests.

Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests that are fair valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee are footnoted in the Portfolio of Investments. Level
3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are valued based on either third-party
pricing service prices obtained from dealer runs and indicative sheets from
brokers or are valued using broker quotes. The values are based on unobservable
and non-quantitative inputs. The Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted valuation
procedures that are utilized by the Advisor's Pricing Committee to oversee the
day-to-day valuation of the Fund's investments. The Advisor's Pricing Committee,
through the Fund's fund accounting agent, monitors the daily pricing via
tolerance checks and stale and unchanged price reviews. The Advisor's Pricing
Committee also reviews monthly back testing of pricing service prices by
comparing sales prices of the Fund's investments to prior day pricing service
prices. Additionally, the Advisor's Pricing Committee reviews periodic
information from the Fund's third-party pricing service that compares secondary
market trade prices to their daily valuations.

(d)   Calculated by taking the Fund's total assets less the Fund's total
      liabilities, not including the loan outstanding, and dividing by the
      outstanding loan balance in 000's.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2016


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing primarily in a portfolio of senior
floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans")(1). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Fund, which is an investment company within the scope of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, follows
accounting and reporting guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 946, "Financial Services-Investment Companies." The following is a summary
of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The Fund's NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value. Market
value prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or
foreign exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from
third-party pricing services. Fair value prices represent any prices not
considered market value prices and are either obtained from a third-party
pricing service or are determined by the Pricing Committee of the Fund's
investment advisor, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor"),
in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with provisions of the 1940 Act. Investments valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee, if any, are footnoted as such in the footnotes to
the Portfolio of Investments. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

      The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
      securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought
      and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private
      transactions that function in many respects like an over-the-counter
      secondary market, although typically no formal market-makers exist. This
      market, while having grown substantially since its inception, generally
      has fewer trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other
      types of securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade
      infrequently, and information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be
      widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the
      fair market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated
      information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
      elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans
      than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are fair
      valued using information provided by a third-party pricing service. The
      third-party pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from
      dealer runs and broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior
      Loans. If the pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a
      particular Senior Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, the
      Advisor's Pricing Committee may value such Senior Loan at a fair value
      according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in
      accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Fair valuation of a Senior
      Loan is based on the consideration of all available information,
      including, but not limited to the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;

-----------------------------
(1)   The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.


                                                                         Page 21

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2016


      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
     10)    the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
     11)    the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
     12)    borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
     13)    borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
     14)    other relevant factors.

      Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or
      foreign exchange (excluding The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") and the
      London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at
      the last sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded
      or, for Nasdaq and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities
      traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale
      price or official closing price, as applicable, at the close of the
      securities exchange representing the principal market for such securities.

      Securities traded in an over-the-counter market are fair valued at the
      mean of their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and otherwise
      at their closing bid price.

      Corporate bonds, corporate notes and other debt securities are valued on
      the basis of valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such
      securities or by a third-party pricing service approved by the Fund's
      Board of Trustees, which may use the following valuation inputs when
      available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;
      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.

      Fixed-income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of 60
      days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for
      amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts (amortized cost),
      provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined that the use of
      amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and
      issuer-specific conditions existing at the time of the determination.
      Factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
      use of amortized cost include, but are not limited to, the following:

      1)    the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      2)    the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      3)    the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes
            thereto (such as significant changes in interest rates);
      4)    issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
            deterioration); and
      5)    any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing
            portfolio securities using amortized cost.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate, the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities
generally include, but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities
which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")) for which a pricing service is unable to
provide a market price; securities whose trading has been formally suspended; a
security whose market or fair value price is not available from a
pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to which an event has
occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after the
market has closed but before the calculation of the Fund's NAV or make it
difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation; and a security
whose price, as provided by the pricing service, does not reflect the security's
fair value. As a general principle, the current fair value of a security would
appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect to receive for
the security upon its current sale. When fair value prices are used, generally
they will differ from market quotations or official closing prices on the
applicable exchanges. A variety of factors may be considered in determining the
fair value of such securities, including, but not limited to, the following:

      1)    the type of security;
      2)    the size of the holding;
      3)    the initial cost of the security;

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2016


      4)    transactions in comparable securities;
      5)    price quotes from dealers and/or pricing services;
      6)    relationships among various securities;
      7)    information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the
            appropriate stock exchange;
      8)    an analysis of the issuer's financial statements; and
      9)    the existence of merger proposals or tender offers that might affect
            the value of the security.

The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2016, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward purchase commitments as of May
31, 2016.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
$181,647 as of May 31, 2016.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior
to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt
from registration under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified
institutional buyers. As of May 31, 2016, the Fund held restricted securities as
shown in the following table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that
such securities be registered. These securities are valued according to the
valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and
are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted investments with the same
maturity date and yield for this issuer.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2016


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, resulting in book and tax accounting
differences, have been reclassified at year end to reflect an increase in
accumulated net investment income (loss) of $67,525, an increase in accumulated
net realized gain (loss) on investments of $717,665, and a decrease to paid-in
capital of $785,190. Net assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2016 and 2015 is as follows:

Distributions paid from:                                2016            2015
                                                    ------------    ------------
Ordinary income.................................    $ 23,493,344    $ 22,405,442

As of May 31, 2016, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...................    $     61,467
Undistributed capital gains.....................              --
                                                    ------------
Total undistributed earnings....................          61,467
Accumulated capital and other losses............    (108,523,298)
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)......     (17,498,743)
                                                    ------------
Total accumulated earnings (losses).............    (125,960,574)
Other...........................................              --
Paid-in capital.................................     500,645,942
                                                    ------------
Net assets......................................    $374,685,368
                                                    ============

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal and state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years after December 31, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term
and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for
up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the
Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment
net capital losses. At May 31, 2016, for federal income tax purposes, the Fund
had capital loss carryforwards available that are shown in the following table,
to the extent provided by regulation, to offset future capital gains through the
years indicated. To the extent that these loss carryforwards are used to offset
future capital gains, it is probable that the capital gains offset will not be
distributed to the Fund shareholders.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2016

Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for federal
income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, the Fund incurred
and elected to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses     $           --
Capital Losses           5,550,904

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2013, 2014,
2015 and 2016 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2016,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois corporation
controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets (the average
daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's
administrator, fund accountant and transfer agent in accordance with certain fee
arrangements. As administrator and fund accountant, BNYM IS is responsible for
providing certain administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including
maintaining the Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities
transactions, and certain other books and records. As transfer agent, BNYM IS is
responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The Bank of New
York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's custodian in accordance with certain
fee arrangements. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody of the Fund's
assets. BNYM IS and BNYM are subsidiaries of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation, a financial holding company.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer that is allocated equally among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex. Prior to January 1, 2016, the fixed annual retainer was allocated pro
rata based on each fund's net assets. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an
annual per fund fee that varies based on whether the fund is a closed-end or
other actively managed fund, or is an index fund.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Independent Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee
Chairmen rotate every three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive
no compensation from the Fund for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2016, were $223,757,450 and
$242,678,448, respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Facility")
with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as
secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The
Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit Facility bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
conduit lender. Effective July 10, 2015, the Credit Facility was amended,
whereby the expiration date of the Credit Facility was extended until July 8,
2016 and the total commitment was reduced from $185,000,000 to $180,000,000. The
Credit Facility may be renewed annually. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act,
the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of
at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The Fund
pays a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.3625% of the daily average of


                                                                         Page 25

                                  MAY 31, 2016

the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the prior
calendar month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i)
0.3625% of the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or if
terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded or
maintained) during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

For the year ended May 31, 2016, the average amount outstanding under the Credit
Facility was $146,568,306. As of May 31, 2016, the Fund had outstanding
borrowings of $137,000,000. The high and low annual interest rates for the loan
under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the year ended May
31, 2016, were 0.68% and 0.24%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.45%. The annual interest rate in effect for the loan at May 31, 2016,
was 0.68%.

                               6. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                                 7. LITIGATION

The Fund has been named as a defendant in litigation pending in the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York as part of the General Motors
bankruptcy case. The plaintiff, the Motors Liquidation Company Avoidance Action
Trust, is an entity formed under the bankruptcy plan of reorganization to
prosecute "avoidance" actions such as preference actions. The lawsuit arises
from years of ancillary litigation concerning whether the former holders of a
term loan to General Motors ("GM"), for which JP Morgan acted as agent, lost
their lien on GM collateral when a Uniform Commercial Code release was
mistakenly filed terminating their interest in certain collateral securing the
term loan. On January 21, 2015, the federal appeals court in New York ruled that
the term lenders' collateral interest was, indeed, terminated.

By virtue of the federal appellate court's decision, all of the former holders
of the term loan, including the Fund, are now being sued in the bankruptcy court
in New York for the avoidance and return of certain payments they received both
before and after the GM bankruptcy filing. The bankruptcy court lawsuit is
premised on the assertion that the term lenders received payments on account of
their status as fully secured creditors when in fact they should not have
received the payments because they were not in fact secured.

The Fund was first served following the filing of the First Amended Complaint on
May 20, 2015. The payments which were received by the Fund in 2009 and which the
plaintiff seeks to recover from the Fund total $8,057,298.44. The Fund has
engaged counsel to assist with its defense of this matter. Based on the current
status of the litigation, the Fund cannot predict the outcome of the litigation
at this time or the impact to Fund net assets, if any.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

Effective July 8, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended whereby the expiration
date was extended until July 7, 2017 and the total commitment was reduced from
$180,000,000 to $170,000,000.

On June 20, 2016, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.07 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 6, 2016, payable July 15, 2016.

On July 20, 2016, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.07 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on August 3, 2016, payable August 15, 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2016 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and agent banks; when replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2016, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                                TAX INFORMATION

Of the ordinary income (including short-term capital gain) distributions made by
the Fund during the year ended May 31, 2016, none qualify for the corporate
dividends received deduction available to corporate shareholders or as qualified
dividend income.

Distributions paid to foreign shareholders between the period January 1, 2016,
and May 31, 2016, that were properly designated by the Fund as "interest-related
dividends" or "short-term capital gain dividends," may not be subject to federal
income tax provided that the income was earned directly by such foreign
shareholders.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Fund may invest up to 100% of its Managed Assets
in lower grade debt securities, which may also be referred to as below
investment grade debt securities. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree. High yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and
risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The high yield securities in
which the Fund invests are not listed on a national securities exchange. Due to
the smaller, less liquid market for the high yield securities, the bid-offer
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to
complete. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, the market for high yield debt has
experienced decreased liquidity, and investor perception of increased risk has
caused yield spreads to widen.


                                                                         Page 29

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. Although the resale, or
secondary market for Senior Loans is growing, it is currently limited. There is
no organized exchange or board of trade on which Senior Loans are traded.
Instead, the secondary market for Senior Loans is an unregulated inter-dealer or
inter-bank resale market. In addition, Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
may require the consent of the borrower and/or agent prior to the settlement of
the sale or assignment. These consent requirements can delay or impede the
Fund's ability to settle the sale of Senior Loans. If the economy experiences a
sudden downturn, or if the market for the Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
becomes distressed, the Fund may have difficulty disposing of Senior Loans if it
needs cash to repay debt, to pay dividends, to pay expenses or to take advantage
of new investment opportunities.

statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $70,000 for 2015 and
$70,000 for 2016.

      (b) AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years, for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under paragraph
(a) of this Item were $0 for 2015 and $0 for 2016.

      AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and related
services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the
performance of the audit of the Registrant's financial statements and are not
reported under paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2015 and $0 for 2016.

      (c) TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant
for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the registrant were $5,200
for 2015 and $5,200 for 2016. These fees were for tax consultation and tax
preparation.

      TAX FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the
last two fiscal years of the registrant for professional services rendered by
the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the
registrant's adviser were $0 for 2015 and $0 for 2016.

      (d) ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of
the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2015 and $0 for 2016.

      ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than services reported
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2015 and $0 for 2016.

      (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

      (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this
Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the pre-approval
exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                          (b)  0%
                          (c)  0%
                          (d)  0%

      (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the
principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees was less than fifty
percent.

      (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's investment
adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio
management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),
and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2015 were $5,200 for the Registrant and $12,700 for the
Registrant's investment adviser and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 were
$5,200 for the Registrant and $14,300 for the Registrant's investment adviser.

      (h) The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

      consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The members

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Team
adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations.

In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the Code of Ethics
and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the Leveraged Finance
Team currently are prohibited from buying or selling equity securities
(including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and futures) and
corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over which they
exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Team are also prohibited
from engaging in any personal transaction while in possession of material
non-public information regarding the security or the issuer of the security.
First Trust and FTP also maintain a restricted list of all issuers for which the
First Trust Advisors L.P. Leveraged Finance Team has material non-public
information in its possession and all transactions executed for a product
advised or supervised by First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the
restricted list.

Trust is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.

                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
