PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, and preferred shares,
by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price
is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given
time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including
supply and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at
the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based
statistical composite of Pennsylvania municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged
and does not include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower
performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

The economy continued to grow during the six-month period ended April 30, 2006,
demonstrating some resiliency in the face of rising oil and other commodity
prices, the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and emerging weakness in the housing market.
This expansion was more modest in the final months of 2005, but gained
considerable momentum in the first quarter.

Against the backdrop of growth and good employment data, the Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") continued raising the federal funds target rate during the
period, implementing four additional increases of 25 basis points each. These
moves brought the target rate to 4.75 percent. The final hike of the period
represented the fifteenth consecutive increase--the longest stretch of increases
in 25 years. As the period came to a close, market observers speculated about
the Fed's near-term intentions, given the central bank's view that although
longer-term inflation currently appeared contained, commodity prices could
amplify inflationary pressures.

Returns across the municipal bond market varied significantly. As investors
sought income opportunities, lower rated bonds outpaced investment-grade bonds
by a wide margin. Long-term bonds earned the best returns, broadly speaking,
while bonds in the three-to-seven year range posted the most muted gains.

Municipal bond issuance was robust during the final months of 2005. (In fact,
2005 marked a record high for municipal bond volume.) The tide changed in 2006,
however. As rising rates discouraged issuers from refinancing debt, national
municipal issuance dropped by approximately 25 percent in the first four months
of the year versus the same period in 2005. While supply ebbed, the market's
appetite for municipal bonds remained strong, with particularly heavy demand
from high yield municipal bond funds.

Within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, issuance did not drop as sharply as the
national average in 2006. Higher education and school district bonds were
particularly well represented in the state's bond market. Pennsylvania has
enjoyed good economic recovery trends, including recent growth in job creation.
Growth in personal income tax revenues has also been strong. However, Medicaid
spending continues to be a concern, and an economic stimulus package is expected
to drive the state's debt level considerably higher.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis and on a market price basis, the trust underperformed
its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity
more expensive, which reduced the benefits of the trust's leverage activities.

Throughout the period, we managed the trust according to a long-term "buy and
hold" discipline anchored by rigorous research. We sought high quality bonds
with attractive return potential and good liquidity. (Liquid securities are
those for which there is a robust market of purchasers and sellers.)

The trust maintained a high credit quality, with nearly 80 percent of bonds
rated AA or higher as of April 30, 2006. While adhering to our quality-driven
discipline, we sought opportunities to enhance the portfolio's yield. For
example, we boosted the trust's stake in BBB rated tobacco revenue bonds. Our
decision to increase tobacco bond exposure reflected our analytical findings of
strong tobacco industry fundamentals and an improving litigation environment. We
also added inverse floating rate securities.

The trust benefited from its emphasis on bonds with long maturities, as this
segment of the market outperformed overall. Our sales focused on bonds with
shorter maturities, generally those with maturities of 10 years or less,
including pre-refunded bonds. We invested these assets, along with proceeds from
bonds which were called by their issuers, in longer-term issues. These purchases

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

reflected our preferences for bonds with maturities of 20 years and longer, and
defensive structures.

Additionally, reflecting the view that interest rates would continue to rise,
with longer-term rates advancing less rapidly, we kept the trust's duration
shorter than its benchmark's. (Duration is a measure of interest rate
sensitivity.) This posture proved advantageous during the period.

The trust's portfolio was well-represented across the major sectors of the
municipal bond market, with a focus on essential services. Higher education,
general purpose, hospital, public education and water and sewer represented the
largest sector weightings as of the close of the period.

During the reporting period, Van Kampen Pennsylvania Quality Municipal Trust,
Trust for Investment Grade Pennsylvania and Van Kampen Advantage Pennsylvania
Municipal Income Trust were merged into Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal
Income Trust.

VPV's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common shares
is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the market
value of the Trust's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you that the
Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the Trust may, when appropriate,
purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at a
price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is lower at the time
of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to seek to provide a high level of current income exempt
from federal and Pennsylvania income taxes and, where possible under local law,
local income and personal property taxes, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania
municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of investment, but may
invest up to 20% of its assets in unrated securities which are believed to be of
comparable quality to those rated investment grade. The Trust commenced
investment operations on April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day on the
exchange on which they are traded. Short-term securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. As of April 30, 2006, the Trust had $8,747,651 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

F. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS During the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Trust's
custody and accounting fees were reduced by $4,975 and $121, respectively, as a
result of credits earned on cash balance.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
of the Trust.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $9,300 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

                                                                              21

</Table>

    On December 2, 2005, the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
the Van Kampen Advantage Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol
VAP), Pennsylvania Quality Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol VPQ) and Trust
for Investment Grade Pennsylvania Municipals (ticker symbol VTP) through a tax
free reorganization approved by VAP, VPQ and VTP Trust shareholders on November
22, 2005. The trust issued 20,131,138 common shares and 7,000 Auction Preferred
Shares (APS) valued at $317,870,416 and $175,000,000, respectively, in exchange
for VAP's, VPQ's, and VTP's net assets. The shares of VAP Trust were converted
into Trust shares at a ratio of 1.005624 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and
APS, respectively. The shares of VPQ Trust were converted into Trust shares at a
ratio of 1.002660 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. The
shares of VTP Trust were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of 1.002103 to 1
and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. Net realized appreciation
of VAP, VPQ and VTP Trust as of December 2, 2005 was $22,548,134. The Trust
assumed VAP, VPQ, and VTP's book to tax accretion differences, which resulted in
a $409,362 increase to accumulated undistributed net investment income and a
corresponding decrease to net unrealized appreciation. Shares issued in
connection with this reorganization are included in proceeds

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED) continued

from shares sold for the six months ended April 30, 2006. Combined net assets
applicable to common shares on the day of reorganization were $388,563,174 and
net assets including preferred shares were $608,563,174. The Trust incurred
merger expenses of $320,746, which represent costs related to the preparation,
printing, and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization
Agreement and registration statements as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $79,797,423 and $68,051,298,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or fixed
income market changes, for duration management or for risk management purposes,
but may also enter into these transactions to generate additional income. All of
the Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to
market each day with the change in value reflected in the unrealized
appreciation/depreciation. Upon disposition, a realized gain or loss is
recognized accordingly, except when taking delivery of a security underlying a
futures contract. In this instance, the recognition of gain or loss is postponed
until the disposal of the security underlying the futures contract.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an arrangement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in exchange traded futures contracts on U.S. Treasury
securities and typically closes the contract prior to the delivery date. These
contracts are generally used to manage the Trust's effective maturity and
duration. Upon entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of
cash or liquid securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract
amount with either a futures commission merchant pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, as amended, or with its custodian in
an account in the broker's name. This amount is known as initial margin. During
the period the futures contract is open, payments are received from or made to
the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the variation
margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in excess of the
variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

                                                                              23

</Table>

B. INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Trust may enter into interest rate swaps primarily to
preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its
portfolio, as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase
in the price of securities the Trust anticipates purchasing at a later date.
Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements to exchange periodic interest
payment streams calculated on a predetermined notional principal amount.
Interest rate swaps generally involve one party paying a fixed interest rate and
the other party paying a variable rate. The Trust will usually enter into swaps
on a net basis, i.e, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement
on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument, with the Trust
receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two
payments. The Trust accrues the net amount with respect to each swap on a daily
basis. This net amount is recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation
on swap contracts. Upon cash settlement of the periodic payments, the net amount
is recorded as realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statement of
Operations. Risks may arise as a result of the potential inability of the
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. If there is a default by
the counterparty, the Trust will have contractual remedies pursuant to the
agreements related to the transaction.

C. INDEXED SECURITIES The Trust invests in indexed securities. These instruments
are identified in the Portfolio of Investments. The price of these securities
may be more volatile than the price of a comparable fixed rate security.

    An inverse floating rate security is one where the coupon is inversely
indexed to a short-term floating interest rate multiplied by a specific factor.
As the floating rate rises, the coupon is reduced. Conversely, as the floating
rate declines, the coupon is increased. These instruments are typically used by
the Trust to enhance the yield of the portfolio.

6. PREFERRED SHARES

As of April 30, 2006, the Trust has outstanding 8,800 APS. Series A contains
1,800 shares, Series B contains 1,600 shares, Series C contains 2,600 shares,
and Series D contains 2,800 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend
rates are generally reset every 7 days for Series A, while Series B, Series C,
and Series D are generally reset every 28 days through an auction process. The
average rate in effect on April 30, 2006 was 3.540%. During the six months ended
April 30, 2006, the rates ranged from 2.680% to 5.250%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED) continued

certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to mandatory redemption if
the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              25
