                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management groups--
                            Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Templeton Dragon Fund's annual report for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2009.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Templeton Dragon Fund delivered cumulative total returns of +63.60% in market
price terms and +58.85% in net asset value terms for the 12 months under review.
You can find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on
page 5.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

After falling dramatically at the end of 2008, equity markets in the greater
China region experienced a tremendous surge in 2009 and the Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) Golden Dragon Index ended the reporting period with
a +67.12% total return in U.S. dollar terms.(1) The substantial rally

was a result of many factors but most significantly the rapid increase in money
supply and liquidity supplied by governments globally to prevent an economic
depression.

Despite the global downturn's severity, China reported encouraging economic data
in 2009. Largely due to government stimulus measures and robust bank lending,
China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated 10.7% year-over-year in
the fourth quarter compared to 9.1% in the third quarter.(2) For 2009, the
economy grew 8.7% year-over-year.(2) The country's foreign exchange reserves
also continued to grow and totaled US$2.4 trillion at the end of December, which
gave China the largest reserves in the world.(3) In the trade sector, exports
steadily improved during the reporting period and resumed growth at 18% in
December, which made China the world's top exporter in 2009.(4) Imports jumped
56% during the same month due to healthy consumer demand and raw materials
imports.(4) Aimed at improving relations with its global trading partners, China
signed a number of agreements with the European Union, Russia, Brazil and Taiwan
in 2009.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources.
Additional considerations include profit margins, returns on investment, capital
resources, government regulation, management and other factors in comparison to
other companies around the world that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

During the year under review, among the most significant contributors to the
Fund's absolute performance were Dairy Farm International Holdings, Sinopec
(China Petroleum and Chemical) and Dongfeng Motor. Dairy Farm operates
supermarkets, hypermarkets (department store and supermarket) as well as
convenience, home furnishing, and health and beauty stores in Asia, and it
benefited from the region's growing consumer demand for basic necessities and
discretionary items. We trimmed the Fund's position in Dairy Farm by period-end
to better diversify risk.

In addition, the Chinese government's fuel price increases served the country's
largest integrated energy company Sinopec well. With China's strong economic
recovery, rising fuel demand also improved Sinopec's prospects. Dongfeng Motor
is the country's third-largest automaker in partnership with foreign automakers
Honda Motor, Nissan Motor and PSA Peugeot-Citroen. Lower raw material costs
early in 2009 and government stimulus measures in boosting car sales supported
Dongfeng Motor and the automobile market, which the government encouraged to
expand both organically and through acquisitions.

In contrast, some of the largest detractors from Fund performance included China
Mobile, Hopewell Holdings and Datang International Power Generation. Shares of
China Mobile, the country's market leader in wireless telecommunication
services, ended the year with a small decline, as investors switched from
defensive holdings to momentum-driven stocks in a rising market, and we reduced
the Fund's position by period-end. Over the longer term, however, we believe the
Fund's investment is well positioned to benefit from the region's recovery.

Another detractor was Hopewell Holdings, a real estate and infrastructure
development company. Its stock posted a minor gain in value but lagged its
regional peers during the reporting period. Concerns of higher costs resulting
from rising coal prices weighed on shares of Datang International Power
Generation, a major Chinese independent power producer. Consistent with our
strategy, we used this opportunity to increase the Fund's position in Datang due
to our assessment of the company's positive outlook and strong market position.

During the review period, we increased the Fund's holdings in coal and
consumable fuels, diversified banking, and Internet software and services
companies due to attractive fundamentals in our view. We also made select
purchases in life and health insurance, steel, and oil and gas exploration and


                               Annual Report | 3

<PAGE>

production companies. We believe these companies are well positioned to benefit
from growing Chinese consumer demand as well as higher commodity prices. Among
our key purchases were Yanzhou Coal Mining, one of China's largest coal
exporters, BOC Hong Kong, the city's premier commercial banking group, and China
Life Insurance, the country's leading life insurance company.

Conversely, we sold some stocks from wireless telecommunication services,
automobile manufacturing, and tire and rubber companies. These sales allowed the
Fund to focus on stocks we deemed to be relatively more attractively valued
within our investment universe. We also sold some stocks as they reached their
sale price targets. Major sales included CIMC (China International Marine
Containers), a transportation equipment maker, and Cheng Shin Rubber Industry,
Taiwan's largest tire manufacturer.

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Dragon Fund. We look
forward to serving your future investment needs.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Equity and other securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ
National Market System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official
closing price of the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of
the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple
markets or on multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. Certain equity securities are valued based upon
fundamental characteristics or relationships to similar securities. Investments
in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.

Foreign equity securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign
stock exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever
is earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign equity security
will be valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices.
The value is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign
exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of
the security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis based upon the underlying investment book value,
anticipated future cash flows, market changes in comparable or similar
securities, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar securities,
or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions on the
disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of
such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed.
Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a security is
completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the
availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio security
held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements following the
close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of country specific
market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository Receipts, futures
contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements are measured against
established trigger thresholds for each specific market proxy to assist in
determining if an event has occurred. If such an event occurs, the securities
may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use of
independent pricing services. All security valuation procedures are approved by
the Fund's Board of Directors.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The Fund may enter
into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate transactions denominated
in a foreign currency. Purchases and sales of securities, income and expense
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Occasionally, events may impact
the availability or reliability of foreign exchange rates used to convert the
U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an event occurs, the foreign exchange rate
will be valued at fair value using procedures established and approved by the
Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of December 31, 2009, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

D. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign

date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences
are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

E. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

F. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

At December 31, 2009, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par
value). During the year ended December 31, 2009 and the year ended December 31,
2008 there were no shares issued; all reinvested distributions were satisfied
with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

The Fund's Board of Directors previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and
year ended December 31, 2008, there were no shares repurchased.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. REORGANIZATION TO A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST

On May 22, 2002, the Board of Directors approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (Agreement) whereby the Fund would be reorganized and its
domicile changed from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The
completion of the reorganization was pending guidance from the National Tax
Agency in Japan relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws
with respect to the Fund's Japanese shareholders. As of December 31, 2009, such
guidance had not been received and the Board approved the termination of the
Agreement and the proposed reorganization will not proceed.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data
obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own market
assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining the
value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair value
hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

At December 31, 2009, all of the Fund's investments in securities carried at
fair value were in Level 1 inputs. For detailed industry descriptions, see the
accompanying Statement of Investments.

At December 31, 2009, the reconciliation of assets in which significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value, is as
follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2009, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2009 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan, unless he elects to withdraw. If
shares are registered in the name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in
"street name"), the broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the
Plan on the shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them
otherwise, or unless the reinvestment service is not provided by the
broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358015,
Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8015, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify The
Bank of New York Mellon (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice ten business days before the record date for a
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in new shares at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
can be made by check or money order payable to The Bank of New York Mellon and
sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA
15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator will
apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of
trading fees) to purchases of the Fund's shares on the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator and sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services,
P.O. Box 358015, Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8015. Upon withdrawal, the participant
will receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's
name for all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant
wishes, the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares held at the
time of withdrawal to cash at current market price and send a check to the
participant for the net proceeds.

DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICE FOR REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS

Cash distributions can now be electronically credited to a checking or savings
account at any financial institution that participates in the Automated Clearing
House ("ACH") system. The Direct Deposit service is provided for registered

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $14,032,068 as a long
term capital gain dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

Under Section 871(k)(2)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $272,688 as a short term capital gain dividend for
purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of the Code for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $5,796,285 as qualified dividends for purposes of the
maximum rate under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009. Distributions, including qualified dividend income, paid
during calendar year 2009 will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV in
January 2010. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax
returns.

At December 31, 2008, more than 50% of the Fund's total assets were invested in
securities of foreign issuers. In most instances, foreign taxes were withheld
from income paid to the Fund on these investments. As shown in the table below,
the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign source income and foreign taxes
paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This designation will allow
shareholders of record on September 16, 2009, to treat their proportionate share
of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid directly by them. The
shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year
in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis of foreign tax paid, foreign
source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by the Fund to
shareholders of record.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

In January 2010, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2009. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2009 individual income
tax returns.

(1)  Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in the
     10% and 15% income tax bracket). In determining the amount of foreign tax
     credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of individuals
     receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may be required
     to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect the rate
     differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules however permit
     certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate differential adjustments
     for capital gains and/or dividends for any taxable year. Please consult
     your tax advisor and the instructions to Form 1116 for more information.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.   N/A

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third-party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third-party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of policy, the
officers, directors/trustees and employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with the
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve all
conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client,
distributor, broker dealer and vendor lists, information periodically gathered
from directors and officers, and information derived from other sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified, the Proxy Group may defer to the voting recommendation of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of
proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with the manager's
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter, along with the recommended
course of action by the manager, if any, to an interdepartmental Proxy Review
Committee (which may include portfolio managers and/or research analysts
employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board or a committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third-party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections 12(d)(1)(E), (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested cash in affiliated money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's
governing documents or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment
manager will vote the shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor that the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted. However, the manager does
not consider recommendations from management to be determinative of the
manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with respect to
most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. The manager will closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
rotate auditors, and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with the shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy issues, the manager conducts an independent review of each
anti-takeover proposal. On occasion, the manager may vote with management when
the research analyst has concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder vote and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will generally vote against any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate voting rights. The manager generally opposes any supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager realizes that a company's financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders, particularly when they
involve the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase. The manager will generally not vote in favor of dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior voting rights. The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend, conversion and other rights of such stock and the terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether they would be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager must be flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the portfolio manager listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures help to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         a Franklin Templeton fund which vest over a three-year period (17.5% to
         25%) and other mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%). The deferred
         equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested interest of the
         portfolio manager in the financial performance of both Franklin
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

o    INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  Primary  consideration  is given to the  historic
     investment  performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding years of all accounts
     managed by the  portfolio  manager.  The pre-tax  performance  of each fund
     managed is measured  relative to a relevant  peer group  and/or  applicable
     benchmark as appropriate.

o    NON-INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.   The  more  qualitative  contributions  of  a
     portfolio manager to the manager's  business and the investment  management
     team, including business knowledge, contribution to team efforts, mentoring
     of junior  staff,  and  contribution  to the  marketing  of the  Fund,  are
     evaluated in determining the amount of any bonus award.

o    RESEARCH.   Where  the   portfolio   management   team  also  has  research
     responsibilities,  each  portfolio  manager is  evaluated on the number and
     performance of recommendations over time.

o    RESPONSIBILITIES.  The  characteristics  and complexity of funds managed by
     the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds,
         and options to purchase common shares of a Franklin Templeton fund.
         Awards of such deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over
         time, so as to create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):

        ----------------------------------------------------------

                                     Dollar Range of Fund Shares
         Portfolio Manager               Beneficially Owned
         ----------------------------------------------------------
         Mark Mobius                          None
         ----------------------------------------------------------
         Eddie Chow                           None
         ----------------------------------------------------------

Note: Because the portfolio managers are all foreign nationals, they do not hold
shares in this U.S. registered fund, however they own shares in other similar
Franklin Templeton funds managed by them, registered offshore and appropriate
for foreign nationals.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
