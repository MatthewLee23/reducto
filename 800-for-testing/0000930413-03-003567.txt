November 14, 2003

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We present you with the semiannual report for Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.
for the six months ended September 30, 2003.

PERFORMANCE

For the six months ended September 30, 2003, Insured Municipal Income Fund
Inc.'s net asset value return was 2.07%. On a market price basis, the Fund's
return was 3.37%. During the same time period, the Fund's peer group, as
measured by the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Median,
generated net asset value and market price returns of 3.23% and 1.63%,
respectively. (For more performance information, please refer to "Performance At
A Glance" on page 6).

The Fund used leverage during the fiscal period, which was 31.7% of total assets
as of September 30, 2003.  Leverage can magnify returns on the upside and on the
downside,  and can create wider  dispersions  of returns  within the Fund's peer
group.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER WILLIAM VERONDA

Q.   CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.   As the reporting period began in April 2003, there was a great deal of
     uncertainty surrounding the economy. First quarter 2003 gross domestic
     product (GDP) growth came in at 1.4%, unchanged from the prior quarter's
     figure. Although the war in Iraq had temporarily stimulated the equity
     markets, its impact on the economy, if any, was at that point uncertain. In
     addition, heightened concerns about terrorism, widening turmoil in the
     Middle East and tepid corporate spending appeared to further undermine the
     economy.

     The following  quarter produced more positive news. The combined effects of
     significantly  higher  military  spending,  an  increase  in exports  and a
     stronger  manufacturing  sector  fueled an up-tick in economic  growth that
     ultimately  resulted in a second quarter 2003 GDP figure of 3.3%.  This was
     followed by a  preliminary  third  quarter  2003 GDP  estimate of 7.2%--far
     higher than  anticipated,  and the sharpest  recorded  advance  since 1984.
     Consumer and business  spending  provided  significant  impetus behind this
     figure;  consumer  spending rose 6.6%,  its highest rate since 1988,  while
     business spending surged 11.1%, its best posting since the first quarter of
     2000.

Q.   WHAT WERE SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ECONOMY?

A.   Consumer spending played an integral role in propping up the economy during
     the period, as the lower interest rate environment engendered a surge in
     mortgage refinancing. The Bush Administration's tax cut package also
     appeared to spur on consumers, who now had more disposable income on hand.

     Conversely, for much of the period, corporations postponed major purchases
     as they waited for clearer indications of a sustainable economic upturn.
     More recently, there have been early signs that business spending is slowly
     improving, although it's not yet clear if spending will increase to the
     point that it will create new jobs.

Q.   HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THE WEAKENING
     ECONOMY?

A.   As the reporting period began, the federal funds rate was at
     1.25%--unchanged since November 2002. The Fed had taken the position that
     it would not implement any further rate cuts, although it would maintain a
     "heightened surveillance" of the economy in light of the conflict with
     Iraq. After the war's start, however, and absent any lift in the economy,
     the Fed made it clear that a future rate cut was likely, citing its view
     that economic weakness was a greater risk than inflation. This cut occurred
     during the Fed's June 25, 2003 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, at
     which time the federal funds rate was lowered by a quarter of a percentage
     point to 1.0%--its lowest level since 1958.

     Since that time, the Fed has remained on hold, although it has made clear
     its willingness to cut rates further if necessary. At its September 16,
     2003 meeting, the Fed rationalized this position by noting "an
     accommodative stance on monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying
     growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic
     activity."

Q.   HOW DID THE BOND MARKET PERFORM DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD?

A.   During the first two months of the period, yields fell and prices rose as
     investors were drawn to the relative safety offered by fixed income
     securities, including municipal bonds, amid ongoing economic and
     geopolitical uncertainty. This scenario changed when, beginning in June
     2003, fixed income prices began to fall. The combined forces that triggered
     this selloff were a less-than-hoped-for cut in the fed funds rate, a
     lessening of concerns regarding the potential for widespread deflation, and
     increasing fears that an improving economy would lead to higher inflation
     and a less accommodative fiscal policy. The selloff gained momentum in July
     before stabilizing during August and September of 2003. Mixed signals in
     terms of the economy--including stubbornly high unemployment--coupled with
     heightened geopolitical concerns, helped the bond market recoup some of its
     losses late in the review period.

Q.   MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S RISING BUDGET DEFICIT. HOW HAS THIS
     AFFECTED THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET?

A.   At the federal level, the US Treasury Department estimates that the federal
     budget deficit was between $370 and $380 billion as of the fiscal year
     ended September 30, 2003. On a state and local level, budgets that were
     developed using a "best case" scenario that factored in a strong economy
     and robust capital gains revenues, operated in an environment characterized
     by an uneven economy and a lengthy bear market. As a result, tax revenues
     were less than projected. Although the final numbers have not yet been
     released, it is projected that over 90% of the states are experiencing
     shortfalls, and state and local budget deficits could ultimately come in at
     $50 billion for the fiscal year. Furthermore, many states expect budget
     shortfalls for fiscal year 2004. While a portion of the state and local
     shortfalls has been met by drawing down on previous surpluses, these have
     now been largely depleted. As a result, federal, state and local
     governments have increased their debt issuance. To a great extent, the
     marketplace has thus far absorbed this added supply.

Q.   HOW DID YOU POSITION THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.   The Fund's duration was generally in line with that of the Lehman Municipal
     Bond Index during the period. In terms of sector positioning, we continued
     to emphasize essential service revenue bonds, including those issued by
     revenue-producing utilities such as water and sewer authorities. We also
     liked the fundamentals of certain airport revenue bonds. While there
     continue to be problems with the airline industry, the need for airfreight
     and transportation remains, and demand should increase as the economy
     strengthens.

     To increase the Fund's level of diversification and maximize investment
     opportunities, we increased our exposure to investment grade securities
     whose ratings are among the very highest. These holdings are those that
     have achieved AAA status on their own merits, without the benefit of
     insurance. Issuers of these types of credits include Columbia University in
     New York, which issues bonds through the New York State Dormitory
     Authority, and Texas A&M University, whose bonds are effectively secured by
     US Treasuries.

Q.   CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF NOTEWORTHY PERFORMERS DURING THE PERIOD?

A.   A number of the Fund's holdings appreciated significantly in price during
     the period, then were subsequently sold when we felt they had become
     overvalued. This occurred, for example, with a block of Chicago long-term
     revenue bonds.

Q.   CAN YOU GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOLDINGS THAT DID NOT MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS?

A.   Securities in the portfolio are constantly monitored to identify possible
     signs of deteriorating underlying credits. During the period, we sold
     several holdings that fell into this category, including Birmingham Baptist
     Medical Center and University of California revenue bonds.

Q.   WERE THERE ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO YOUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY DURING THE
     PERIOD?

A.   Up until recently, the Fund had a policy of investing substantially all of
     its assets in municipal obligations having maturities in excess of 10 years
     at the time of purchase. In July 2003, the Fund's Board of Directors
     approved the elimination of this restriction, allowing the Fund increased
     freedom to invest in shorter-term securities. As a result, while we
     anticipate that the majority of the Fund's portfolio will retain its
     longer-term bias, this change will allow us greater flexibility in pursuing
     compelling opportunities in the marketplace. For example, in the time since
     the policy change went into effect, we purchased Metropolitan Pier & Expo
     District Illinois bonds, due in 2010, which we believe are very
     attractively priced and offer an attractive effective yield.

Q.   HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE POSITIONING THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?

A.   Looking ahead, we anticipate keeping the Fund's duration close to that of
     the Lehman Municipal Bond Index. As we've seen in recent months, interest
     rate movements can occur rapidly. Given the mixed signals surrounding the
     economy, we would expect this type of volatility to continue in the months
     ahead. In terms of the underlying portfolio, we expect to continue our
     long-held emphasis on essential service revenue bonds, especially in light
     of the mounting budget deficits. We also intend to maintain our
     high-quality bias, and to continue to employ careful credit analysis on
     securities being considered for the Fund, as well as on those currently
     held in the portfolio.

Past performance does not predict future performance. The return and principal
value of an investment will fluctuate, so that an investor's shares, when sold,
may be worth more or less than their original cost. NAV return assumes, for
illustration only, that dividends were reinvested at the net asset value on the
ex-dividend dates. Market price return assumes dividends were reinvested under
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. NAV and market price returns for periods of less
than one year are cumulative. Returns do not include brokerage commissions or
taxes paid on realized capital gains.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured  Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended,  as  a  closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a high level of current  income that is exempt from federal  income tax,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States requires the Fund's  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF  INVESTMENTS--The  Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available,  for its portfolio  securities.  The Fund
normally  obtains  market values for its  securities  from  independent  pricing
sources and  broker-dealers.  Independent  pricing sources may use reported last
sale prices,  current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities.  If a market value is
not available from an independent pricing source for a particular security, that
security  is valued at fair  value as  determined  in good faith by or under the
direction of the Fund's Board of Directors  (the  "Board").  The amortized  cost
method of valuation, which approximates market value, generally is used to value
short-term  debt  instruments  with sixty days or less  remaining  to  maturity,
unless the Board determines that this does not represent fair value.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND  INVESTMENT  INCOME--Investment  transactions  are
recorded  on  the  trade  date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual basis.  Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders  at a level rate that over time will result in the  distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding  auction  preferred  shares.  The dividend rate on the common
stock is  adjusted  as  necessary  to  reflect  the  earnings  rate of the Fund.
Dividends  and  distributions  to  common   shareholders  are  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued daily.
The amount of dividends from net investment  income and  distributions  from net
realized  capital  gains is determined  in  accordance  with federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from accounting  principles generally accepted in
the United States. These "book/tax"  differences are either considered temporary
or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              21

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund  follows an  investment  policy of  investing  primarily  in  municipal
obligations  of various  states.  Economic  changes  affecting  those states and
certain of their public bodies and  municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has  approved  an  investment  advisory  and  administration  contract
("Advisory  Contract")  with UBS Global Asset  Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM") under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator of
the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management  subsidiary
of UBS AG,  an  international  diversified  organization  with  headquarters  in
Zurich,  Switzerland  and  operations  in many areas of the  financial  services
industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract,  the Fund pays UBS Global AM
an investment  advisory and administration fee, which is accrued weekly and paid
monthly,  at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's  average  weekly net assets.
UBS Global AM has agreed to waive 0.20% of the advisory and administration  fee,
so that the Fund's  effective  fee is 0.70% of average  weekly net assets.  This
waiver will  continue  indefinitely  unless the Board  agrees to any change.  At
September 30, 2003, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $267,747  representing  $344,246
for investment advisory and administration fees less fee waivers of $76,499. For
the six months  ended  September  30,  2003,  UBS Global AM waived  $362,019  in
investment advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

COMMON STOCK

There are  199,997,000  shares of $0.001 par value common stock  authorized  and
20,628,363  common shares  outstanding at September 30, 2003.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of Auction  Preferred Shares Series A, 800 shares
of Auction  Preferred  Shares Series B, 800 shares of Auction  Preferred  Shares
Series C and 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D, which are referred
to herein  collectively  as the "APS."  All shares of each  series of APS have a
liquidation  preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to accumulated
but unpaid  dividends upon  liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for APS Series
A, 28 days for APS  Series B, 90 days for APS Series C and 7 days for APS Series
D. As of the end of  November  2003,  dividend  periods  for  Series B and C are
expected to be reset every 7 days as well.  Dividend  rates ranged from 0.65% to
1.25% for the six months ended September 30, 2003.

The Fund is subject  to certain  restrictions  relating  to the APS.  Failure to
comply  with these  restrictions  could  preclude  the Fund from  declaring  any
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements  (unaudited)


The APS are  entitled to one vote per share and,  unless  otherwise  required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single  class,  except that the
auction preferred shares will vote separately as a class on certain matters,  as
required by law. The holders of the auction  preferred  shares have the right to
elect two directors of the Fund.

The redemption of the Fund's auction  preferred shares is outside of the control
of the Fund because it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not
solely  within the  control of the Fund.

It is  anticipated  that  the Fund  will  issue  additional  shares  of  Auction
Preferred Shares in December 2003. All shares are expected to have terms similar
to those of the existing APS.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

For federal  income tax purposes,  at September 30, 2003,  the components of net
unrealized appreciation of investments were as follows:

Gross appreciation (from investments having
  an excess value over cost) .....................................  $19,431,089
Gross depreciation (from investments having
  an excess of cost over value) ..................................   (1,842,782)
                                                                    -----------
Net unrealized appreciation of investments .......................  $17,588,307
                                                                    ===========
For the six months ended September 30, 2003, total aggregate purchases and sales
of portfolio securities,  excluding short-term securities, were $113,462,643 and
$159,175,657,  respectively.

The Fund intends to distribute  substantially  all of its tax-exempt  income and
any taxable  income and to comply with the other  requirements  of the  Internal
Revenue Code  applicable  to regulated  investment  companies.  Accordingly,  no
provision for federal  income taxes is required.  In addition,  by  distributing
during  each  calendar  year  substantially  all of its net  investment  income,
realized  capital gains and certain other amounts,  if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions  paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2003 and March 31, 2002 were as follows:

Distributions paid from:                                   2003          2002
                                                       -----------   -----------
Tax-exempt income ..................................   $19,306,799   $18,703,218
                                                       -----------   -----------

The tax  character  of  distributions  paid and the  components  of  accumulated
earnings (deficit) on a tax basis for the current fiscal year will be calculated
for the portfolio after the portfolio's fiscal year end at March 31, 2004.

    stock at the current  market price on the first day of each period  reported
    and a sale at the  current  market  price  on the  last  day of each  period
    reported,  and assuming reinvestment of dividends and other distributions to
    common   shareholders   at  prices   obtained  under  the  Fund's   Dividend
    Reinvestment  Plan.  Total  investment  return  does not  reflect  brokerage
    commissions  and has not been  annualized for the period less than one year.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") under
which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names, or
in the  name of UBS  Financial  Services  Inc.  or its  nominee,  will  have all
dividends and other  distributions on their shares of common stock automatically
reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such common shareholders
elect to receive cash.Common  shareholders who elect to hold their shares in the
name of  another  broker or nominee  should  contact  such  broker or nominee to
determine whether,  or how, they may participate in the Plan.The ability of such
shareholders  to  participate  in the  Plan  may  change  if  their  shares  are
transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common  shareholder  may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty,  and common  shareholders
who have previously  terminated  participation  in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time.  Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should  include  the  shareholder's  name and  address as they appear on the
share  certificate or in the transfer agent's records.  An election to terminate
participation  in the Plan,  until such  election is changed,  will be deemed an
election by a common  shareholder to take all subsequent  distributions in cash.
An election  will be  effective  only for  distributions  declared  and having a
record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is received.

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.



GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONCLUDED)

Additional  shares of common stock  acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than  the net  asset  value  per  share of the  common  stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to the result  obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend  payable
to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including applicable
brokerage  commissions)  that the transfer  agent was able to obtain in the open
market.  The Fund will not issue any new  shares of common  stock in  connection
with the Plan.  There  currently is no charge to  participants  for  reinvesting
dividends or other  distributions.  The  transfer  agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment  of  distributions  will  be  paid  by  the  Fund.  However,   each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions.  The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and
other  distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve  participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.  Accordingly,
the Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate  the Plan with respect to any
dividend  or  other  distribution  if  notice  of the  change  is  sent  to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution.  The
Plan also may be  amended or  terminated  by the  transfer  agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants.  Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the  transfer  agent at PFPC Inc.,  P.O. Box 43027,  Providence,
Rhode Island  02940-3027.  For further  information  regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331-1710.

I, Joseph A. Varnas,  President of Insured  Municipal Income Fund Inc.,  certify
that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Insured  Municipal Income Fund
     Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of  operations,  changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in  Rule  30a-3(c)  under  the  Investment  Company  Act of  1940)  for the
     registrant and have:

          (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our
               supervision,  to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made
               known to us by others within those entities,  particularly during

               and  procedures,  as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

          (c)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's  internal
               control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred  during  the
               registrant's  most  recent  fiscal  half-year  (the  registrant's
               second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
               affect,   the   registrant's   internal  control  over  financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  All  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting
               which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability  to record,  process,  summarize,  and  report  financial
               information; and

          (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.

     a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in  Rule  30a-3(c)  under  the  Investment  Company  Act of  1940)  for the
     registrant and have:

          (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our
               supervision,  to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made
               known to us by others within those entities,  particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared;

          (b)  Evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
               controls  and   procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our
               conclusions  about the  effectiveness of the disclosure  controls
               and  procedures,  as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

          (c)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's  internal
               control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred  during  the
               registrant's  most  recent  fiscal  half-year  (the  registrant's
               second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
               affect,   the   registrant's   internal  control  over  financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  All  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting
               which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability  to record,  process,  summarize,  and  report  financial
               information; and

          (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.
