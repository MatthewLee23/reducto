Letter to Stockholders


GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW
    The benign interest rate environment and tame inflation, combined with
strong growth in India and China and sustained consumer spending in the U.S.,
were the main drivers for the strong global equity showing in 2005. Currencies
were influenced by interest rate expectations, and in quite a few markets
strong performance in local currencies was partially lost when translated into
U.S. dollars. As was the case in 2004, small- and mid-cap stocks outperformed
large-cap stocks; emerging markets outperformed developed markets; and value
outperformed growth. The energy and raw material sectors continued to benefit
from the strength of the emerging market economies.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE
    The Swiss market was among the strongest in Europe, and Europe had better
performance in U.S. dollar terms than the United States. Factors behind the
strength in the Swiss market included a more accommodative monetary policy,
better exposure to emerging markets and the continued trend towards more
business combinations. Mergers and acquisitions activity has just started in
Europe with the establishment of a pan-European debt market to finance buy-out
groups. Political setbacks (such as the EU constitutional referendum) have
largely been ignored by the Swiss and European markets. International money has
continued its significant flows into Europe and Switzerland in anticipation of
improvement in the economic landscape, in valuations, and in earnings growth.
This compares favorably with the U.S. market which is thought by many to be
plateauing or deteriorating.

    As investor outlook becomes as global as the economy, investors are
increasingly paying less attention to the national location of particular
companies. Valuations across borders have converged strongly. Switzerland
out-performed the rest of Europe, thanks to the worldwide dominance of its
large corporations such as UBS AG, Nestle AG, Novartis AG and Roche AG. Nestle
and UBS are harvesting the benefits of years of incisive investments and
restructuring programs. Swiss pharmaceutical companies continue to benefit from
a strong pipeline of new products and much lower exposure to patent expirations
than their peers. In addition, in the mid-cap segment several companies have
emerged as global leaders. These include Kuehne & Nagel International AG in
trade forwarding and logistics, Sika AG in specialty chemicals and SGS Societe
Generale de Surveillance Holding SA in industrial inspections, testing and
verification services. As we have noted in past reports; Swiss companies, faced
with a small domestic market, survived by expanding internationally early in
their history. This put them in position to benefit from the current trend
toward globalization.

    The Fund clearly outperformed the Standard and Poor's 500 Index as measured
in U.S. dollars, despite an appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss
franc, but underperformed the Swiss Performance Index (SPI) by 2.41% in Swiss
francs. This is mostly due to the large increase in stock

prices of the largest companies in the SPI since September. The Fund
historically, and for regulatory reasons, is less concentrated than the SPI in
the top five companies.

    As of December 31, 2005, the Fund had a rating of three stars from
Morningstar.*

*Morningstar is an independent fund performance monitor. Its ratings reflect
historic risk-adjusted performance and may change monthly. Its ratings of one
(low) and five (high) stars are based on a fund's three- and five-year average
annual total returns with fee adjustments, and a risk factor that reflects fund
performance relative to three-month Treasury Bill monthly returns. Only 33% of
the funds in an investment category may receive four or five stars. As of
December 31, 2005, there were 9 funds in the Fund's asset category rated by
Morningstar.

SWISS MARKET NEWS
    Swiss Reinsurance Company has agreed to acquire GE Insurance Solutions, the
fifth largest worldwide reinsurer, from General Electric Company. Once this
acquisition receives regulatory and shareholder approval, Swiss Reinsurance
Company will become the world's largest reinsurer, ahead of Munich RE.

    Adecco SA is no longer co-chaired as Philippe Floriel-Destezet resigned as
a co-chairman. Klaus Jacobs, who shared the role of chairman with
Mr. Floriel-Destezet, is taking over as sole chairman and interim CEO. At the
end of December, Jacobs Holding owned 22% of Adecco.

    In December, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania issued a
plan that would settle one of ABB Ltd.'s biggest asbestos liabilities. Although
this plan must be affirmed by the District Court and not be appealed, it is an
important step towards final resolution of the asbestos issue.

    Crucell, a Dutch biotechnology company, made a bid in December for Berna
Biotech AG, the Swiss vaccine company.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    On December 15, 2005, the Swiss National Bank (SNB), strictly following the
European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy, increased the target range for the
three-month LIBOR by 0.25% to 0.50-1.50% and intends to hold the rate in the
middle of the target range for the time being.

    By increasing the rates, SNB responded to the positive signs of an economic
recovery. The third quarter exceeded the previous quarter by an annualized
figure of 4.3%. While this was mainly driven by the export sector, SNB noted
that the domestic economy seems to be gradually picking up as well. For 2005,
SNB increased its forecasts for GDP growth from 1% to 1.5%, and for 2006 it
forecasts a growth rate slightly higher than 2%. With three-month LIBOR at 1%,
SNB forecasts inflation rates to be at 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, for 2006
and 2007. This will continue an expansionary monetary policy.

    The unemployment rate decreased in October from 3.8% to 3.7%. SNB expects a
more pronounced recovery in the labor market, as it sees signs of a recovery in
corporate investments in the third quarter of 2005.

    The interest rate on the 10-year confederation bond finished the year at
1.96%, after reaching a peak of 2.28% in the beginning of November.

CURRENCIES
    The increase in the interest rate differential in the context of the global
savings glut has been a short-term driver for the U.S. dollar, which
appreciated 15.90% against the Swiss franc. The Swiss franc was almost flat
against the euro, which is explained by the monetary policies of SNB and ECB.
The appreciation of the U.S. dollar could be challenged as ECB and, in its
steps, SNB started to increase rates in the last quarter of 2005.

</TABLE>

OUTLOOK/STRATEGY
VALUATION
    Valuation is not expected to be a driver this year for either stocks or
bonds. Price earnings multiples for stocks are in line with historical averages
but on the high side when adjusted for the economic cycle (normalized earnings
versus current peak earnings).

    While equity risk premiums are high relative to bonds, fixed income
instruments exhibit very low nominal yields and tight credit spreads (corporate
bonds and emerging market debt).

    Valuations should not precipitate a severe correction in the market as long
as risk free rates stay low on the long end of the curve.

INTEREST RATES
    After enjoying a period of very strong performance, Europe (not including
the United Kingdom) and the emerging markets are entering a cycle of interest
rate tightening while, in the United States, the Federal Reserve is expected to
pause soon. This scenario would support the euro and the Swiss franc and be
detrimental to the U.S. dollar.

    The U.S. yield curve is inverted, which has often preceded a recession, but
this time around it could only be a sign of an economic slowdown. Technical
factors such as the need for emerging market economies to recycle their
surpluses and the pressure for pension funds to reform by building a strong
incentive to closely match assets and liabilities, continue to create strong
demand for long term debt instruments.

    On the other side, while inflation expectations are dampened by low
readings on the Consumer Price Index, the Index does not capture most of the
inflation occurring in financial and real estate assets.

    The slow progression of real wages (an impact of globalization) and the
moderate progression in the price of goods and services is keeping central
banks accommodative.

RISKS TO MONITOR
    The geo-political situation and the potential avian flu pandemic are
external risk factors to assess. A sharp rise in U.S. long-term rates and a
slowdown in U.S. consumer

Letter to Stockholders (concluded)

spending (as inflation gives way to more stability or to deflation) are the
most obvious threats to the markets. Globalization will continue to bring
benefits and mitigate the impact of imbalances in the economic aggregates of
different countries. The main risk here is a slowdown in this globalization
process and the beginning of trade sanctions against emerging markets exporters.

STRATEGY
    For the Swiss market, Management expects strong volatility in financials
and in economically-sensitive stocks, especially in the small and mid-cap
areas. To counter that development the Fund's investments are directed more
towards defensive large-cap stocks. Management will, however, take advantage of
any volatility to buy quality financial, cyclical and growth stocks at lower
levels.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
    Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market
purchases of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999
and has continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of
the stock repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the
Fund's net asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect
upon the Fund's expense ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the
Fund repurchased and retired 422,100 shares at an average price of $15.56 per
share (including brokerage commissions) and a weighted average discount of
13.80%. These repurchases, which had a total cost of $6,568,476, resulted in an
increase of $1,044,349 to the Fund's net asset value.

    The Board has authorized the Fund to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares
during 2006.

Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
On December 31, 2005, there were no fair valued securities.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as a reduction of dividend income, net
of any amount reclaimable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax
treaty between the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and makes
distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of these
distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles.

F. SECURITIES LENDING INCOME
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their market value. For the initial transaction, the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish collateral with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or government securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction, the Fund requires
the

                                      24

                         THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of
the securities loaned. The Fund receives fees as compensation for lending its
securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the securities loan
at any time. There were no securities on loan during the 2005 fiscal year.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

I. CASH BALANCES
The Fund maintains cash in an interest bearing account that, at times, may
exceed U.S. federally insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses
in such account and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit
risk on such account.

J. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Fund enters into contracts in the normal course of business that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts. Management has reviewed the Fund's existing
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

NOTE 2--FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.
and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich), is the Fund's advisor (the "Advisor"). The Fund
pays the Advisor an annual fee based on its month-end net assets which is

next $100 million, 0.55% of the next $100 million, and 0.50% of such assets in
excess of $600 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Fund paid the
Advisor $3,214,790 in investment advisory fees. The Fund paid Hottinger & Cie
$64,225 in brokerage commissions for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The Fund and the Advisor have agreed to share certain common expenses subject
to review and allocation by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board.
As of December 31, 2005, the Committee allocated $77,376 of expenses incurred
in connection with publicizing the Fund as follows: $38,688 to the Fund and
$38,688 to the Advisor.

Certain officers and directors of the Fund are also officers or directors of
HCC, Hottinger U.S., Inc. and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich). These persons are not
paid by the Fund for serving in these capacities.

NOTE 3--OTHER FEES
Citigroup Fund Services, LLC ("Citigroup") provides certain administration and
portfolio accounting services to the Fund.

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Fund's transfer agent. The Fund
pays the transfer agent an annual fee which is accrued daily and paid monthly.

Swiss American Securities Inc. is the Fund's U.S. custodian. Credit Suisse
First Boston is the Fund's Swiss sub-custodian. The Fund pays the custodian and
sub-custodian an annual fee.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)


The Fund pays each director who is not an interested person (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund, its Advisor, or Citigroup, approximately
$23,800 per annum in compensation, except for the Chairmen of the Audit

annual fee of approximately $28,800. In addition, the Fund pays each
disinterested director $1,300 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for each
committee meeting attended, if it is held separately. In addition, the Fund
reimburses directors who are not employees of or affiliated with the Advisor
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in conjunction with attendance at meetings.

NOTE 5--FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 2005, accumulated net investment income and accumulated net
realized gain (loss) from investments and foreign currency transactions have
been adjusted for current period permanent book/tax differences which arose
principally from differing book/tax treatments of foreign currency transactions.

The following reclassification was a result of currency losses and has no
impact on the net assets of the Fund.

NOTE 6--STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999 and has
continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Fund
repurchased and retired 422,100 shares at an average price of $15.56 per share
(including brokerage commissions) and a weighted average discount of 13.80%.
These repurchases, which had a total cost of $6,568,476, resulted in an
increase of $1,044,349 to the Fund's net asset value.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments,
as of December 31, 2005, and the related statements of operations for the year
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five
years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2005, by
correspondence with the custodians. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Fund as of December 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

the portfolio manager's decisions or who come into possession of

   The fundamental principle of the Codes is that the individuals covered by

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

   The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

How does the Plan work?
The cash portion of any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in
whole or in part in cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number
of shares credited to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will
depend upon the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset
value per share on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as
described below:

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price
increases to a level above the net asset val-

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited) (concluded)

ue, AST will complete its purchases, even though the result may be that the
average price paid for the purchases exceeds net asset value.

Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend, payable in cash, will be
reinvested in additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase
of whole shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares
(rounded to three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:

   By mail:
     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
     PO Box 922
     Wall Street Station
     New York, NY 10269-0560

   Through the Internet:
     www.amstock.com

   Through AST's automated voice response System:
     1-888-556-0425

AST will furnish you with a copy of the Terms and Conditions of the Plan
without charge.

code of  ethics,  as  defined  in  Item 2 of Form  N-CSR,  that  applies  to its
principal  executive officer and senior financial officer. A copy of the code of
ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE  FINANCIAL  EXPERT The  Registrant's  Board of Directors
(the "Board") has determined that Messrs. Didier  Pineau-Valencienne  and Samuel
B. Witt, III, Esq., each a member of the audit committee of the Board, are audit
committee financial experts as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  "SEC").  Messrs.  Pineau-Valencienne  and Witt each are  "independent"  as
defined  by  the  SEC  for  purposes  of  audit   committee   financial   expert
determinations.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES
(a) The  aggregate  fees  billed  for  each of the last two  fiscal  years  (the
"Reporting  Periods") for  professional  services  rendered by the  Registrant's
principal  accountant  for  the  audit  of  the  Registrant's  annual  financial
statements,  or services that are normally provided by the principal  accountant
in connection  with the statutory and regulatory  filings or engagements for the
Reporting Periods, were $36,000 in 2004 and $38,575 in 2005.

(b) There were no  audit-related  fees billed to the Registrant in the Reporting
Periods for assurance and related services rendered by the principal  accountant
that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Registrant's
financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this Item 4.

There were no fees billed in the  Reporting  Periods for  assurance  and related
services  rendered by the principal  accountant to the  Registrant's  investment
adviser and any entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common control with
the  investment  adviser  that  provides  ongoing  services  to  the  Registrant
(collectively  the "investment  adviser") which were required to be pre-approved
by the audit committee as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this Item 4.

(c) The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods for professional services
rendered by the principal  accountant to the Registrant for tax compliance,  tax
advice and tax planning ("Tax Services") were $4,000 in 2004 and $4,200 in 2005.

and excise tax returns.

services reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item.

engagements  for audit and  non-audit  services to the  Registrant,  and certain
non-audit   services  to  the  investment   adviser  that  are  required  to  be
pre-approved  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Pre-approval  considerations  include
whether the proposed  services are  compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
accountant's independence.

(e) (2) No  services  included  in (b) - (d) above  were  approved  pursuant  to
paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

for non-audit  services  rendered by the principal  accountant to the investment

<PAGE>

(h) The  Registrant's  Audit  Committee  considers  whether the provision of any
non-audit  services  rendered to the investment  adviser not  pre-approved  (not
requiring  pre-approval)  by the Audit Committee is compatible with  maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

in accordance with Section  3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS
Not applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES
The Registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio  holdings
to its investment adviser,  Hottinger Capital Corp. (the "Advisor"), to vote the
Registrant's  proxies in accordance with Advisor's  proxy voting  guidelines and
procedures.  The  Advisor has  adopted  proxy  voting  guidelines  (the  "Voting
Guidelines") that provide as follows:

o        The Advisor  votes  proxies in respect of a client's  securities in the
         client's best economic interests and without regard to the interests of
         the Advisor or any other client of the Advisor.

o        Unless the Advisor's Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") otherwise
         determines  (and  documents the basis for its decision) or as otherwise
         provided below,  the Advisor votes proxies in a manner  consistent with
         the Voting Guidelines.

o        To avoid material conflicts of interest, the Advisor applies the Voting
         Guidelines  in  an  objective  and  consistent   manner  across  client
         accounts. Where a material conflict of interest has been identified and
         the matter is covered by the Voting Guidelines,  the Committee votes in
         accordance with the Voting Guidelines. Where a conflict of interest has
         been identified and the matter is not covered by the Voting Guidelines,
         the  Advisor  will   disclose   the   conflict   and  the   Committee's
         determination of the manner in which to vote to the Registrant's  Audit
         Committee.

o        The  Advisor  also may  determine  not to vote  proxies  in  respect of
         securities  of any  issuer  if it  determines  that it  would be in the
         client's overall best interests not to vote.

The Advisor's Voting  Guidelines  address how it will vote proxies on particular
types of matters such as the election  for  directors,  adoption of option plans
and anti-takeover proposals. For example, the Advisor generally will:

o        support  management in most elections for  directors,  unless the board
         gives  evidence of acting  contrary to the best  economic  interests of
         shareholders;

o        support  option  plans,  if it  believes  that they  provide  for their
         administration  by  disinterested  parties  and  provide  incentive  to
         directors,  managers  and other  employees by aligning  their  economic
         interests with those of the shareholders while limiting the transfer of
         wealth out of the company; and

o        oppose anti-takeover proposals unless they are structured in such a way
         that they give  shareholders  the ultimate  decision on any proposal or
         offer.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

PRINCIPAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

         As of the date of the  filing  of this  Report on Form  N-CSR,  Messrs.
Philippe Comby and Rudolf Millisits are primarily responsible for the management
of the Registrant's portfolio.

         Mr. Comby has been a portfolio  manager of the  Registrant  since 1999,
when he joined the Advisor.  Mr. Comby is a Vice President of the Registrant and
a Director and Senior Vice  President of the Advisor.  He also is a Director and
the  President of Hottinger  U.S.,  Inc.  and the Chief  investment  Officer and
Senior Vice  President of Hottinger  Brothers LLC, each of which is a registered
investment  adviser  affiliated with the Advisor.  Mr. Comby has been affiliated
with the Hottinger Group since 1994,  providing portfolio  management and client
advisory services.  He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts,
a member of Global Association of Risk  Professionals and a Chartered  Financial
Analyst.

         Mr.  Millisits  has been a portfolio  manager of the  Registrant  since
1994, when he joined the Advisor. Mr. Millisits is the Senior Vice President and
Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Registrant  and the Chief  Operating  Officer,
Executive Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer of the Advisor. He also is
the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer of  Hottinger  U.S.,  Inc.  and the
President and Chief Financial Officer of Hottinger Brothers,  LLC. Mr. Millisits
has been  affiliated  with the  Hottinger  Group since 1993,  proving  portfolio
management and private banking  services.  Prior to joining the Hottinger Group,
Mr.  Millisits was a portfolio  manager for private clients for Credit Suisse in
New York and Geneva.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

         The  Registrant's  portfolio  managers manage  multiple  accounts for a
diverse client base, including private clients and institutions.

         MATERIAL  CONFLICTS  RELATED TO  MANAGEMENT  OF SIMILAR  ACCOUNTS.  The
potential for conflicts of interest exist when the Advisor or its affiliates and
the portfolio  managers manage other accounts that invest in securities in which
the  Registrant  may  invest  or that  may  pursue  a  strategy  similar  to the
Registrant's  strategy  (collectively,  "Similar  Accounts").  In addition,  the
Registrant,  as  a  registered  investment  company,  is  subject  to  different
regulations than certain of the Similar Accounts, and, consequently,  may not be
permitted to engage in all the  investment  techniques  or  transactions,  or to
engage in such  techniques or  transactions  to the same degree,  as the Similar
Accounts.

         Potential  conflicts  of  interest  may arise  because  of a  portfolio
manager's  management  of the  Registrant  and Similar  Accounts.  For  example,
conflicts  of interest may arise with both the  aggregation  and  allocation  of
securities transactions and allocation of limited investment  opportunities,  as
the  portfolio  manager  may be  perceived  as  causing  accounts  he manages to
participate  in an offering to increase his overall  allocation of securities in
that offering,  or to increase his ability to participate in future offerings by
the same  underwriter  or issuer.  Allocations of bunched  trades,  particularly
trade orders that were only partially  filled due to limited  availability,  and
allocation  of  investment  opportunities  generally,  could  raise a  potential
conflict of interest, as the portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate
securities that are expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Initial
public offerings,  in particular,  are frequently of very limited  availability.
Additionally,  the  Registrant's  portfolio  managers may be perceived to have a
conflict of interest because of the number of Similar  Accounts,  in addition to
the Registrant, that they are managing. In addition, the Advisor could be viewed
as  having  a  conflict  of  interest  to the  extent  that the  Advisor  or its
affiliates and/or the portfolio  managers have a materially larger investment in
a Similar Account than their investment in the Registrant.

         A  potential  conflict  of  interest  may  be  perceived  to  arise  if
transactions in one account  closely follow related  transactions in a different
account,  such as when a purchase  increases the value of securities

previously  purchased by the other account, or when a sale in one account lowers
the sale price received in a sale by a second account.

         OTHER  ACCOUNTS  MANAGED BY THE  PORTFOLIO  MANAGERS.  The chart  below
includes  information  regarding  the  Registrant's  portfolio  managers,  as of
December 31, 2005.  Specifically,  it shows the number of other  portfolios  and
assets,  including  the  Registrant,   managed  by  the  Registrant's  portfolio
managers.  Neither  portfolio manager manages any accounts with respect to which
the advisory fee is based on this performance of the account.

COMPENSATION FOR THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

         The portfolio managers are generally  responsible for managing multiple
types of  accounts  that  may,  or may not,  invest in  securities  in which the
Registrant  may invest or pursue a strategy  similar to one of the  Registrant's
strategies.

         During the fiscal  period  covered by this  Report on Form  N-CSR,  the
Registrant's  portfolio  managers were  compensated by a competitive  salary and
bonus structure,  which was determined both  quantitatively  and  qualitatively.
Salary and bonus are paid in cash. The portfolio managers are compensated on the
performance of the aggregate  group of portfolios  they manage rather than for a
specific fund or account. Various factors are considered in the determination of
the  portfolio  managers'  compensation.  All of the  portfolios  managed by the
portfolio  managers are  comprehensively  evaluated to determine  each portfolio
manager's  positive and consistent  performance  contribution over time. Further
factors  include the amount of assets in the  portfolios as well as  qualitative
aspects that reinforce the Advisor's investment philosophy.

         Total  compensation is generally not fixed,  but rather is based on the
following  factors:  (i) leadership and commitment,  (ii) maintenance of current
knowledge and opinions on companies owned in the portfolio; (iii) generation and
development of new investment ideas,  including the quality of security analysis
and  identification of appreciation  catalysts;  (iv) ability and willingness to
develop  and share  ideas;  and (v) the  performance  results of the  portfolios
managed by the portfolio managers.

         Variable  bonus  is  based  on  the  portfolio  managers'  quantitative
performance  as  measured by their  ability to make  investment  decisions  that
contribute to the pre-tax  absolute and relative returns of the accounts managed
by the portfolio  manager,  by comparison to  predetermined  benchmarks (for the
Registrant,  the Swiss  Market Index and the Swiss  Performance  Index) over the
current  fiscal year and the  longer-term  performance  (3-,  5- or 10-year,  if
applicable),  as well as performance  relative to peers. The portfolio managers'
bonuses  also can be  influenced  by  subjective  measurement  of the  managers'
ability to help others make investment decisions.

OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES OF THE REGISTRANT

     As of  December  31,  2005,  Mr.  Comby  and Mr.  Millisits  owned  between
$10,001-$50,000  and over $100,000 of shares of common stock of the  Registrant,
respectively.

                          THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.   Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

         This code of ethics (the "Code") for The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, or other persons performing similar functions, each of whom
is listed on Exhibit A (the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Covered Officers Should Handle  Ethically Actual and Apparent  Conflicts of
     Interest


         Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his
position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of the Fund and the Fund's
investment advisor (the "Advisor") are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures.

<PAGE>

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Advisor of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Advisor, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Advisor and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Advisor and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that
the Code cannot enumerate every possible scenario. The overarching principle of
the Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    not  use  his  personal   influence  or  personal   relationships
               improperly  to  influence   investment   decisions  or  financial
               reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered  Officer  would benefit
               personally to the detriment of the Fund;

          o    not cause the Fund to take action,  or fail to take  action,  for
               the  individual  personal  benefit of the Covered  Officer rather
               than the benefit of the Fund; and

          o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports
               of potential violations that are made in good faith.

III.     Disclosure and Compliance

          o    Each  Covered  Officer  should   familiarize   himself  with  the
               disclosure  requirements  and disclosure  controls and procedures
               generally   applicable   to  the   Fund   within   his   area  of
               responsibility;

          o    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent,  or cause
               others to misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others,  whether
               within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members
               and auditors, and to governmental  regulators and self-regulatory
               organizations; and

          o    to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility, each
               Covered  Officer should consult with other officers and employees
               of the Fund and the Advisor and take other appropriate steps with
               the  goal  of  promoting  full,   fair,   accurate,   timely  and
               understandable  disclosure  in the reports and documents the Fund
               files  with,   or  submits  to,  the  SEC  and  in  other  public
               communications made by the Fund; and

<PAGE>

          o    it is the  responsibility  of each  Covered  Officer  to  promote
               compliance  with  the  standards  and  restrictions   imposed  by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    upon adoption of the Code (or  thereafter,  as  applicable,  upon
               becoming a Covered Officer),  affirm in writing to the Board that
               he has received, read, and understands the Code;

          o    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with
               the requirements of the Code; and

          o    notify the Audit Committee (the "Committee") promptly if he knows
               of any  violation  of the  Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself  a
               violation of the Code.

         The Audit Committee is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation and to grant waivers sought by
any Covered Officer. The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing the Code:

          o    the Committee will take all appropriate action to investigate any
               potential violations reported to it;

          o    if, after such  investigation,  the  Committee  believes  that no
               violation has occurred, the Committee is not required to take any
               further action;

          o    if the Committee  determines  that a violation  has occurred,  it
               will inform and make a  recommendation  to the Board,  which will
               consider  appropriate  action,  which may include  review of, and
               appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
               notification  to  appropriate  personnel  of the  Advisor  or its
               board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer; and

          o    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required,
               will be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       Other Policies and Procedures

         The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies and procedures of the Fund, the Advisor or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to the Code, they are superceded by the Code to the extent that
they overlap or conflict with the provisions of the Code. The Fund's and the
Advisor's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and
the Advisor's additional policies and procedures are separate requirements
applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

<PAGE>

VI.      Amendments

         Except as to Exhibit A, the Code may not be amended except in written
form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the
Fund's Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII.     Confidentiality

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall
not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund and its counsel, the Board (or
Committees thereof) and its counsel, and the Advisor.

VIII.    Internal Use

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
