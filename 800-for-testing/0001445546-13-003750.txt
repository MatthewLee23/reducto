                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                    ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO

                                  MAY 31, 2013


Dear Shareholders:

I am pleased to present you with the annual report for your investment in First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund").

The report you hold contains detailed information about your investment, a
portfolio commentary from the Fund's management team that provides a recap of
the period, a performance analysis and a market and Fund outlook. Additionally,
you will find the Fund's financial statements for the period this report covers.
I encourage you to read this document and discuss it with your financial
advisor. A successful investor is also typically a knowledgeable one, as we have
found to be the case at First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust").

The twelve months covered by this report have been more positive for the U.S.
markets. In fact, the S&P 500 Index, as measured on a total return basis, rose
27.25% during the period, and many economists and investors have felt positive
about the current market environment. Of course, past performance can never be
an indicator of future performance. As I have written many times, First Trust
believes that staying invested in quality products through up and down markets
and having a long-term horizon can help investors reach their financial goals.

As you know, First Trust offers a variety of products that we believe could fit
many financial plans to help investors seeking long-term investment success. We
encourage you to talk to your advisor about the other investments First Trust
offers that might also fit your financial goals and to discuss those goals with
your advisor regularly so that he or she can help keep you on track.

First Trust will continue to make available up-to-date information about your
investments so you and your financial advisor are current on any First Trust
investments you own. We value our relationship with you, and thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals. I look forward to
the remainder of 2013 and to the next edition of your Fund's report.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees and
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PORTFOLIO MANAGER

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II The primary investment objective
of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to
seek a high level of current income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts
to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio
of Senior Loans. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives
will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP
During the period covered by this report, capital markets were strong and
generally supported by positive economic reports in the U.S. and relatively
benign news regarding the European sovereign debt situation, including the
hiccup regarding the Cyprus bailout. The period began with a focus on European
sovereign debt issues and concerns regarding the strength of the U.S. economy,
which resulted in increased market volatility, and ultimately ended with a
renewed focus on the Federal Reserve's bond buying program, unemployment, and
interest rates. The senior loan market had positive returns in every month over
the last 12 months as the positive economic backdrop supported a strong credit
environment. Overall, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the "Index") returned
8.70% for the full year period. Lower credit-quality issues in the Index
performed better than higher credit-quality issues in the period. BB rated loans
returned 4.61% and B rated loans returned 6.19%, both of which were
significantly behind the lower quality CCC rated loan return of 25.81% for the
period.

Fundamental credit quality remained strong over the period with default rates
trending below the historic average. The default rate began the period at 1.05%
and ended at 1.40%, well inside the historic average of 3.31% (March 1999 - May
2013).

Two trends in the market that have helped keep default volumes in check are
solid corporate fundamentals and robust capital markets activity. Regarding
corporate fundamentals, senior loan issuers that file their financial results
publicly grew cash flows by approximately 7% year-over-year in the first quarter
of 2013 (latest data available), which represents 15 straight quarters of cash
flow growth. This extended period of cash flow growth has given companies the
opportunity to strengthen their balance sheets. The second positive trend is the
active capital markets, which have provided companies with the ability to
refinance near-term debt maturities with longer dated paper at lower interest
rates. This process of extending maturities tends to help alleviate a potential
catalyst for future defaults and the lower rate eases a company's interest
burden.

Technical conditions in the senior loan market were strong over the period, with
positive inflows into the asset class from retail senior loan funds and
institutional structured products in all 12 months. Total inflows across retail
and institutional investors over the last year were $110 billion, with available
new-issue supply of only $34.3 billion. With credit quality remaining strong and
positive inflows into the asset class, average loan prices increased from $93.5
at the beginning of the period to $98.2 at the end of May 2013. As such, price
appreciation was the primary driver of total return for the Index over the last
year.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The Fund outperformed the Index for the one-year period ended May 31, 2013. The
Fund generated a net asset value ("NAV") return of 11.92% and a market price
return of 14.80%. The Fund's market price return benefitted by the Fund's market
price beginning at a slight discount to NAV and moving to a slight premium to
NAV by the end of the period. At the start of the period, the Fund's market
price was at a -1.04% discount to NAV, and it moved to a modest 1.52% premium to
NAV by the end of the period.

                                                                          Page 3

PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2013

From an income perspective, the Fund announced three increases to the monthly
distribution rate for a total increase of $0.0075 per share over the year ended
May 31, 2013. The monthly announced distribution rate began the period at $0.08
per share and ended at $0.0875 per share. This increase represented an
improvement of approximately 9.4% in the level of monthly distributions to
shareholders over this period. At the $0.0875 per share monthly distribution
rate, the annualized distribution rate at the end of May 2013 was 6.94% at NAV
and 6.83% at market price.

Contributing to the Fund's outperformance relative to the Index over the period
was the Fund's use of leverage and issuer selection. Leverage at the end of May
was approximately 30.27%. The Fund's relatively conservative credit quality
positioning detracted slightly from performance as CCC and lower-rated issues
led the market return. At the end of the period, the Fund held only 2.5% of
assets in issues rated CCC or below compared to 12% for the Index.

OUTLOOK
We believe the combination of a low corporate default environment, modestly
positive economic growth and strong investor demand provides a firm backdrop for
returns in the periods ahead. Moreover, given the heightened sensitivity
exhibited by traditional fixed-income on the basis of potential lower Federal
Reserve stimulus (Quantitative Easing tapering), which is likely to lead to
higher interest rates, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for the senior
loan asset class. In our opinion, the combination of relatively attractive
ultra-short duration floating-rate income within a market plagued by anemic real
yields and long duration, when coupled with a senior secured position in the
capital structure in a low corporate default rate environment, are tenets that
should continue to support performance.

We expect our rigorous credit process and focus on identifying attractive
risk-adjusted return opportunities in the market will continue to position the
portfolio well for the periods ahead. Our portfolio strategy of balancing the
goal of high current income with portfolio risk remains unchanged. We do not
anticipate changing the average credit quality of the portfolio in a meaningful
way over the near term. As such, the portfolio should remain of higher average
credit quality than the Index. In the upcoming periods, we expect the new issue
market to provide some compelling opportunities which may enhance the portfolio
characteristics. In our opinion, the combination of attractive new issuance and
our focus on relative value opportunities across the market should continue to
position the portfolio well for the periods ahead.

</TABLE>

-----------------------------

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
      prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
      certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
      floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
      reflects the rate in effect at May 31, 2013. When a range of rates is
      disclosed the fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche at
      varying rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   This issuer is in default and interest is not being accrued by the Fund
      nor paid by the issuer.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)
MAY 31, 2013

(e)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended, and may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant to
      procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has been
      determined to be liquid by First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's advisor.
      Although market instability can result in periods of increased overall
      market illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on
      security specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective
      judgment. At May 31, 2013, securities noted as such amounted to $3,587,750
      or 0.90% of net assets.

(f)   This security is fair valued in accordance with procedures adopted by the
      Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(g)   This issuer has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(h)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(i)   This Note is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note whereby
      1.00% of interest per annum is to be paid in cash and 13.75% of interest
      per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely in cash,
      (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) a combination thereof.
      Interest is to be paid semi-annually; however, the issuer is in default
      and income is not being accrued.

(j)   Non-income producing security.

(k)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $590,632,398. As of May
      31, 2013, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $5,542,340 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $5,939,359.

(a)   From inception to October 12, 2010, Four Corners Capital Management, LLC
      served as the Fund's Sub-Advisor. Effective October 12, 2010, the
      Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First Trust Advisors L.P. assumed the
      day-to-day responsibility for management of the Fund's portfolio.

(b)   Auction Market Preferred ("AMP") Shares.

(c)   Total return is based on the combination of reinvested dividend, capital
      gain and return of capital distributions, if any, at prices obtained by
      the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and changes in net asset value per share
      for net asset value returns and changes in Common Share price for market
      value returns. Total returns do not reflect sales load and are not
      annualized for periods less than one year. Past performance is not
      indicative of future results.

(d)   Ratio reflects the effect of distributions to AMP Shareholders.

(e)   Managed Assets are calculated by taking the Fund's total asset value
      (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares, if AMP
      Shares are outstanding, and the principal amount of borrowings), minus the
      sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any outstanding AMP
      Shares, if AMP Shares are outstanding, and liabilities, other than the
      principal amount of borrowings.

(f)   As of November 18, 2009, the Fund no longer has any Series A or Series B
      AMP Shares outstanding.

(g)   Includes accumulated and unpaid distributions to AMP Shareholders.

(h)   Calculated by taking the Fund's total assets less the Fund's total
      liabilities (not including the AMP Shares liquidation value), and dividing
      by the number of AMP Shares outstanding.

(i)   Calculated by taking the Fund's total assets less the Fund's total
      liabilities (not including the AMP Shares liquidation value and the loan
      outstanding) and dividing by the outstanding loan balance in 000's.

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2013


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004 , and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior
floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans"). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily in accordance with valuation procedures
adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with provisions of
the 1940 Act. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and
sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. The third party
pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from dealer runs and
broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior Loans.

Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or foreign
exchange (excluding the NASDAQ(R) Stock Market, LLC ("NASDAQ") and the London
Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at the last
sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded or, for NASDAQ
and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price or official closing
price, as applicable, at the close of the securities exchange representing the
principal market for such securities.

Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when purchased
are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.

In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation, or the valuations received are deemed
unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities.
Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal markets for
certain securities (e.g., domestic debt securities and foreign securities) that
could materially affect the Fund's NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method
to value the Fund's securities. The use of fair value pricing is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act. As a general principle, the fair value of a
security is the amount which the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the
security upon its current sale. In light of the judgment involved in fair
valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair value assigned to a particular
security will be the amount which the Fund might be able to receive upon its
current sale. Fair valuation of a security is based on the consideration of all
available information, including, but not limited to, the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;

      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;

                                  MAY 31, 2013

      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;

      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;

      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;

      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;

      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;

      8)    the coupon payments;

      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;

      10)   the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;

      11)   the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;

      12)   borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;

      13)   borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and

      14)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2013, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward purchase commitments as of May
31, 2013.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund did not have unfunded delayed draw loan
commitments as of May 31, 2013.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
May 31, 2013, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. These

                                                                         Page 23

securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as stated in the
Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a discount to
the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There are no

* Amount is less than 0.01%.

(1)   Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July
      31, 2007.

E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the
year ended May 31, 2013, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have
been reclassified at year end to reflect an increase in accumulated net
investment income (loss) of $101, an increase in accumulated net realized gain
(loss) on investments of $149,506 and a decrease to paid-in capital of $149,607.
Net assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2013 and 2012 is as follows:


                 Distributions paid from:           2013               2012
                                               -------------      -------------
                 Ordinary income               $  26,429,210      $  21,979,654

As of May 31, 2013, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:


                 Undistributed ordinary income..................  $   1,704,157
                 Undistributed capital gains....................             --
                                                                  -------------
                 Total undistributed earnings...................      1,704,157
                 Accumulated capital and other losses...........    (99,308,450)
                 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).....       (397,019)
                                                                  -------------
                 Total accumulated earnings (losses)............    (98,001,312)
                 Other..........................................        (25,715)
                 Paid-in capital................................    498,851,876
                                                                  -------------
                 Net assets.....................................  $ 400,824,849
                                                                  =============

F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2013


Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years after December 31, 2010, may be
carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term
and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for
up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the
Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment
net capital losses. At May 31, 2013, the Fund had pre-enactment net capital
losses for federal income tax purposes of $99,308,450 expiring as follows:

         EXPIRATION DATE             AMOUNT
         May 31, 2016          $    778,618
         May 31, 2017          $ 25,585,953
         May 31, 2018          $ 68,278,827
         May 31, 2019          $  4,665,052

During the taxable year ended May 31, 2013, the Fund utilized pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $5,977,075.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2010, 2011,
2012 and 2013 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2013,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The

controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's investment
portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee

daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's

providing certain administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including
maintaining the Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities
transactions, and certain other books and records. As transfer agent, BNYM IS is
responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The Bank of New
York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's custodian in accordance with certain
fee arrangements. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody of the Fund's
assets.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer of $125,000 per year and an annual per fund fee of $4,000 for each
closed-end fund or other actively managed fund and $1,000 for each index fund in
the First Trust Fund Complex. The fixed annual retainer is allocated pro rata
among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $15,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $10,000 annually, and each of the
Chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Valuation Committee
is paid $5,000 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation

assets. Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and each Committee
Chairman will serve two-year terms until December 31, 2013, before rotating to
serve as Chairman of another Committee or as Lead Independent Trustee. After
December 31, 2013, the Lead Independent Trustee and Committee Chairman will
rotate every three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no
compensation from the funds for acting in such capacities.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2013, were $734,341,254 and
$704,557,872, respectively.


                                                                         Page 25

                                  MAY 31, 2013


                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit
Facility") on July 13, 2012, with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender
and The Bank of Nova Scotia as secondary lender and agent for the secured
parties under the agreement. Liberty Street Funding LLC repaid all amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit and Security Agreement dated as of August
2, 2004, with CRC Funding LLC, as conduit lender, Citibank, N.A., as Secondary
Lender and Citibank North America, Inc., as Agent (the "Terminated Facility"),
with the proceeds of the initial borrowing under the Credit Facility. The Credit
Facility has an expiration date of July 12, 2013, and may be renewed annually.
The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where
Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets
after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$175,000,000. For the year ended May 31, 2013, the average amount outstanding
under the Terminated Facility and the Credit Facility was $163,619,178. The
loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest for each settlement
period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the conduit
lender. The high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the
Terminated Facility and the Credit Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during
the year ended May 31, 2013, were 0.46% and 0.22%, respectively, with a weighted
average interest rate of 0.25%. The annual interest rate in effect for such
loans at May 31, 2013, was 0.22%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs,
which include a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.40% of the daily
average of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the
prior calendar month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of
(i) 0.40% of the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or if
terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded or
maintained) during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

                           6. COMMON SHARE OFFERINGS

On November 21, 2012, the Fund and the Advisor entered into a sales agreement
with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC ("JonesTrading") whereby the Fund
may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 Common Shares from time to time through
JonesTrading as agent for the offer and sale of the Common Shares. Sales of
Common Shares pursuant to the sales agreement may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" as defined in
Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales
made through a market maker other than on an exchange, at an offering price
equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share of the Fund's Common
Shares at the time such Common Shares are initially sold. The Fund intends to
use the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares in accordance with its
investment objectives and policies. Transactions for the period ended May 31,
2013, related to offerings under such sales agreement are as follows:


                                                                NET PROCEEDS
        COMMON                                                   RECEIVED IN
        SHARES           NET PROCEEDS      NET ASSET VALUE      EXCESS OF NET
         SOLD              RECEIVED        OF SHARES SOLD        ASSET VALUE
     ------------        ------------      ---------------      ------------
       1,029,480         $ 16,309,080       $  15,524,292       $    784,788

Additionally, offering costs of $235,169 related to this offering were recorded
as a prepaid asset and are being amortized to expense by the Fund on a straight
line basis over the lesser of one year or until the Fund sells 3,000,000 Common
Shares related to this offering.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On June 20, 2013, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0875 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 3, 2013, payable July 15, 2013.

On July 22, 2013, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0875 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on August 5, 2013, payable August 15, 2013.

The Fund renewed its Credit Facility on July 12, 2013, with Liberty Street
Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as secondary lender
and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The Credit Facility has a
new expiration date of July 11, 2014, and may be renewed annually. The total
commitment under the Credit Facility was increased from $175,000,000 to
$190,000,000. The utilization fee of 0.40% per annum and the commitment fee of
0.40% per annum were each reduced to 0.35% per annum. In addition, the Fund paid
a $95,000 amendment fee which will be amortized over a one year period and
included in "Interest and fees on loans" on the Statement of Operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2013, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2013, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and agent banks; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2013, the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                            MAY 31, 2013 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

    (1)    If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
           the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
           equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii)
           95% of the market price on that date.

    (2)    If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
           Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
           purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere,
           for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price
           for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has
           completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per
           share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time
           of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the
           dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the
           Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions
           received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market within
           30 days of the valuation date except where temporary curtailment or
           suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with federal
           securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
           payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in

                                                                         Page 29

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                            MAY 31, 2013 (UNAUDITED)


compliance with certain Credit Facility provisions, the Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use
of leverage by the Fund increases the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV
and market price of the Common Shares. Leverage also increases the risk that
fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund
may pay will reduce the return to the Common Shareholders or will result in
fluctuations in the dividends paid on the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK. Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy
experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become
distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in
sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to
raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by
Fund shareholders.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

      (a)   The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report,

            principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
            accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
            functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by
            the registrant or a third party.

      (c)   There have been no amendments, during the period covered by this

            that relates to any element of the code of ethics description.

      (d)   The registrant has not granted any waivers, including an implicit
            waiver, from a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the
            registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial
            officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
            performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
            individuals are employed by the registrant or a third party, that
            relates to one or more of the items set forth in paragraph (b) of
            this item's instructions.

      (e)   Not applicable.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

As of the end of the period covered by the report, the registrant's Board of
Trustees has determined that Thomas

R. Kadlec and Robert F. Keith are qualified to serve as audit committee
financial experts serving on its audit committee and that each of them is
"independent," as defined by Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

      (a) AUDIT FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed for each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
accountant for the audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or
services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $67,000 for 2012 and
$90,000 for 2013.

      (b) AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years, for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under paragraph
(a) of this Item were $0 for 2012 and $0 for 2013.

      AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and related
services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the
performance of the audit of the Registrant's financial statements and are not
reported under paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2012 and $0 for 2013.

      (c) TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the last

registrant's adviser were $0 for 2012 and $0 for 2012.

      (d) ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of

accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2012 and $0 for 2013.

      ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than services reported
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2012 and $0 for 2013.

      (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
             described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

      (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
             through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
             adviser of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
             pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph
             (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
             are as follows:

                          (b)  0%

                          (c)  0%

                          (d)  0%

      (f)   The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
            engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the
            most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
            persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent
            employees was less than fifty percent.

      (g)   The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
            for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the
            registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
            provides ongoing services to the Registrant for 2012 were $10,400
            and $10,320 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
            adviser, respectively, and for 2013 were $5,200 and $3,000 for the
            Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser, respectively.

      (h)   The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
            that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not
            pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
            Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
            accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

      (a)   The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
            consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The
            members of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B.
            Nielson, Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

      (a)   Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of
            the close of the reporting period is included as part of the report
            to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

      (b)   Not applicable.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Investment
Team adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations. In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the
Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the
Leveraged Finance Investment Team currently are prohibited from buying or
selling equity securities (including derivative instruments such as options,
warrants and futures) and corporate bonds for their personal account and in any
accounts over which they exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance
Investment Team are also prohibited from engaging in any personal transaction
while in possession of material non-public information regarding the security or
the issuer of the security.

First Trust and FTP also maintain a restricted list of all issuers for which the
Leveraged Finance Investment Team has material non-public information in its
possession. All transactions executed for a product advised or supervised by
First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the restricted list.

      (a)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
             MEMBERS

INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF MAY 31, 2013

The compensation structure for the First Trust Leveraged Finance Investment Team
is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined by the
management of First Trust.

Salaries are determined by management and are based upon an individual's job
position, duties, and overall value to the firm. Bonuses are also determined by
management and are based upon an individual's overall contribution to the
success of the firm and the profitability of the firm. Salaries and bonuses for
members of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team are not based upon the
performance of the Fund. However, the Leverage Finance Team receives a basis
point fee on the value of assets of the Fund. Discretionary bonuses for the
Leveraged Finance Team members are based, in part, on the profitability of the
Leveraged Investment Finance department.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.

      (b)   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
            our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

            statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles;

      (c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

      (d)   Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
            control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
            fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
            materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      (a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
