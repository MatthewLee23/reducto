MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - SERIES G
("MULTI-ADVISER-G" OR THE "PORTFOLIO")
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multi-Adviser-G was up 8.69% for calendar year 2006. As further described below,
please find a summary of results for the Portfolio's  hedge fund strategy groups
for the year, as well as our outlook going forward.

In 2006,  hedge funds performed in line with the expectations we set back at the
end of 2005.  At that point in time we  expected  hedge  funds to deliver mid to
high single-digit  returns while maintaining a modest  volatility  profile;  the
HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index  gained  9.25% for the year.  Despite the fact that
investing  is  a  continual   process,   one  that  requires  ongoing  research,
assessments of changing markets and the development of forward looking opinions,
we are continually  asked: "How will hedge funds perform in the new year?" While
compartmentalizing  time periods can be an arbitrary and misleading exercise, it
is helpful so far as it provides a measure of relative performance. For 2007, we
see a modest  increase in returns  versus the high  single-digit  performance of
2006. Based on our current  expectations,  we believe it is reasonable to expect
hedge funds to return on average 10% to 11% net of fees.

Historically,  the first and  fourth  quarters  have been  kinder to hedge  fund
managers than the second and third, and 2006 was no exception to this pattern of
performance.  In fact  the  fourth  quarter  really  salvaged  the year for many
managers.  At the end of the third quarter, the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index was
up 3.82%,  most of which was  earned  during  the first  quarter.  In the fourth
quarter, the index jumped by nearly 5.25%, and the pattern held. As we move into
the first quarter of the new year,  market  conditions  and the  positioning  of
portfolios  by  hedge  fund  managers  appear  to be  in  alignment,  and  it is
reasonable to expect solid  performance in the first quarter on the heels of the
momentum built during the end of 2006.

Citigroup  Alternative  Investments' (CAI's) external hedge fund business breaks
down  the  hedge  fund  universe  into  four  categories:   Directional   Macro,
Directional  Equity,  Event Driven and Relative  Value  Arbitrage,  with each of
these categories divided into a number of specific sub-strategies.

Over the next several quarters,  CAI is neutral on the Directional Macro sector.
The  opportunity  set for Macro  managers  is,  and should  remain,  attractive.
However, the trading environment that currently exists has made it difficult for
many macro  managers to capitalize on the  opportunity  set. We currently  favor
short-term  higher frequency traders and traders that utilize both technical and
fundamentals  factors in their decision  process.  Additionally,  greater weight
should be placed on managers  that  utilize a  discretionary  component in their
trading  approach.  Despite the change in policy by the Bank of Japan,  interest
rates in that country  remain low and are expected to remain low relative to the
returns  available  in the  rest  of the  world,  as such  borrowing  in Yen and
investing in other higher yielding investments is expected to continue.

The  Yen  carry  trade  as it is  known,  should  be  watched  closely,  as  any
acceleration  in the  unwinding  of this trade will have a negative  impact on a
number of strategies.  This trade is not only related to Macro managers, but can
also have an impact on a number of other hedge fund  sectors.  Remember,  just a
hint of this trade  unwinding  contributed to the sell off of last May and June.
Should this trade really  unwind the markets will be in for some very  difficult
times.

The Directional Equity strategy continues to be viewed positively.  Based on our
current  expectations,  this should be one of the better  performing  hedge fund
sectors in 2007. In part,  our positive  outlook for the sector is a function of
our continued  expectations for positive global equity markets.  However,  while
constructive  on equities for the year,  we do  anticipate a modest pull back in
the near term,  most likely  sometime  toward the end of the first or during the
second quarter.  Also supporting the outlook are the  demographics of the equity
markets.  The combination of corporate share repurchase  plans,  ongoing private
equity activity and companies going private,  (especially in the small and micro
cap space  which also  happens to be favored by many hedge fund  managers),  all
tend to reduce the supply of available stock.

At the same time, the demand for investments  continues to grow. This demand has
been  supported  by the amount of capital  that has been  created  over the past
several years,  the high level of liquidity in the markets and the growth of the
global economy.  These conditions clearly support the beta component that exists
in the  portfolios  of  managers in this  space.  Concerns do exist  however and
should be kept in mind.  One such  concern for US equities is that US  companies
have benefited  from four years of quarter on quarter  earnings  growth.  Can it
continue? Perhaps, but at some point it will stop and the market will come under
pressure.  In  addition,  there does appear to be a little too much  complacency
about the continuation of the "goldilocks" stock market.

Within the Long Short strategy, Emerging Market focused managers are expected to
continue to perform  well.  The  emerging  markets have grown up and are in much
better  financial  shape  than the past.  In  addition,  emerging  markets  have
developed more  established  and robust local economies and are beginning to see
internal demand for investments.  As the BRIC and the other EM countries build a
middle class and incomes  increase,  their  populations will begin to invest and
will support their own markets.  But please note that despite what some see as a
new paradigm for emerging markets this sub-sector will continue to be subject to
significant sell offs, witness May of 2006. This should not discourage investors
from investing in EM focused hedge funds;  it simply  requires  identifying  the
right managers and sizing them appropriately.

It's worth  keeping in mind one does not or at least should not buy long - short
equity  hedge funds just for a beta trade;  after all there are cheaper  ways to
get beta  exposure.  We  believe  the  current  environment  favors  good  stock
selection and the market will  differentiate  between good and bad companies and
long - short  managers are in the business to capture  these  opportunities.  We
favor  managers in this sector that utilize name  specific  shorts versus market
shorts.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overall,  we have a  "Negative"  bias  toward  the  Relative  Value -  Arbitrage
category.  Given  current  conditions  for many of the trades and the  generally
higher levels of leverage  utilized in this space, we believe the risk reward is
less attractive than in other sectors.  Further,  the dispersion of stock prices
has been declining and negatively impacting the strategy.  Convertible arbitrage
is  interesting  as a hedge  against a market  dislocation,  however,  given the
current shape of the yield curve and the tightness of credit  spreads,  a better
play would be to focus on volatility  arbitrage focused managers,  or to utilize
other strategies that tend to be long volatility such as multi-strategy managers
in the relative value space.

From a  theoretical  perspective,  mangers  in the market  neutral  sub-strategy
should be able to make money (by  definition,  50  percent  of all stocks  under
perform  the market and 50 percent out perform  the  market),  and we  recommend
these as well as  statistical  arbitrage  strategies  within the Relative  Value
strategy group.

Our view of the  Event  Driven  sector  is  "Positive."  Some of the same  macro
factors that are supportive for long/short equity mangers are expected to play a
positive  role in the event space as well.  Private  equity  investors and their
buying power should be  supportive  for a number of the  sub-strategies  in this
space as long as financing markets stay attractive;  the private equity bid will
support  managers  that are long value  companies  with real  assets.  Investors
should remember to watch for common risk factors as  correlations  between these
two sectors may be higher than they have been historically.

We believe the primary  focus  within the Event  Driven space should be on event
driven-equity and activist  managers.  These managers typically have a long bias
(and therefore a beta component),  but they also tend to be highly  concentrated
and focused on producing  alpha. As a result,  they may be subject to short-term
market moves, but over time their correlation to the markets should be low.

Given the volume of deal flow, merger arbitrage should remain attractive both in
the U.S.  and on a global  basis.  We would tend to focus on global  managers or
European managers over U.S.-only focused funds due to greater  inefficiencies in
the markets, and thus more attractive spreads.

With credit spreads  trading at very tight levels,  we believe that the Credit -
Distressed  sub-strategy  should be played  conservatively.  Focus  should be on
managers that know how to and actively short credit, certain cash flow and asset
backed lenders,  and managers that are invested in the senior secured portion of
the capital structure.

The hedge fund  universe is clearly  comprised of many diverse  strategies  with
varying  expectations  for  returns.  We believe that the  dispersion  of return
expectations  is  significantly  less  today  than in the past due to  declining
market  volatility  (across asset  classes) and the decline in risk premiums for
many of the markets  and  trading  instruments.  Further,  we believe  this is a
function of the  abundance  of  liquidity  in the markets - money  looking for a
home, and has lead to over complacency by investors.

Despite the compression of expected returns across strategies,  we expect to see
significant   dispersion  of  returns  amongst  individual   managers.   Manager
selection,  which has always  been  important  when  investing  in hedge  funds,
becomes even more critical in the current environment. In fact, having the right
managers  may add  greater  value to a fund of hedge  funds  portfolio  than the
actual  strategy  allocations.  We believe  investors  must  continue  to remain
diversified in this  environment  and within the hedge fund universe by sampling
from the many  different  ways to take risk  across the  spectrum  of hedge fund
strategies.

CITIGROUP ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC -- MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2007
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
          LLC (the  "Company"  or "Fund") was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited
          Liability  Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered under
          the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended,  as a
          closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company
          is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"). The
          Company consisted of two separate series,  Series M and Multi-Strategy
          Series G (each a  "Series").  On  December  31,  2006,  Multi-Strategy
          Series G ("Series G") acquired all of the Members' Capital of Series M
          pursuant to a plan of  reorganization  and merger approved by Series G
          and Series M shareholders  on November 29, 2006.  (Refer to note 2 for
          additional information on the merger).

          The   investment   objective  of  Series  G  is  to  achieve   capital
          appreciation   principally   through  investing  in  investment  funds
          ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by  third-party   investment  managers
          ("Investment   Managers")   that  employ  a  variety  of   alternative
          investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies allow Investment
          Managers the  flexibility  to use leverage or short-side  positions to
          take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies across the global markets,
          often  referred to as  "alternative"  strategies.  Because  Investment
          Funds following alternative  investment strategies are often described
          as hedge funds, the investment program of Series G can be described as
          a fund of hedge funds.

          Shares  of Series G are sold to  eligible  investors  (referred  to as
          "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in  Series G from each
          Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000 from January 1, 2003 to November 1,
          2003); the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

          Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or the  "Adviser"),  a
          Delaware  limited  liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
          subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., serves as Series G's investment adviser.
          The  Adviser  is  registered  as  an  investment   adviser  under  the
          Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and, among other things,
          is  responsible  for the  allocation  of Series  G's assets to various
          Investment Funds.  Under Series G's governing  documents,  the Company
          has delegated substantially all authority to oversee the management of
          the operations and assets of Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.   ACQUISITION OF SERIES M

          The acquisition of Series M was accomplished by a tax-free exchange of
          52,023.277  shares  of  Series  G  (valued  at  $60,906,789  including
          $6,456,550 of  distributions  to be reinvested on January 1, 2007) for
          the  56,389.683  shares of Series M outstanding  on December 31, 2006.
          Series M's Members' Capital on December 31, 2006 consisted of cash and
          cash  equivalents of $728,506,  investments in investment funds with a
          fair market value of $23,519,791  (cost of  $18,490,000),  receivables
          from  investment  funds of  $38,490,179,  and other assets of $25,545,
          offset by redemptions payable of ($1,615,659), management fees payable
          of ($82,772), and accounts payable and accrued expenses of ($158,801).

          acquisition was $226,551,248.

     3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms of the
          respective limited partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
          agreements and offering  memoranda.  Series G values these investments
          at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the  Investment
          Funds.

          A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

          The net  asset  value of  Series G is  determined  as of the  close of
          business  at the end of each month in  accordance  with the  valuation
          principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to time
          pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

          Series G's  investments in Investment  Funds are carried at fair value
          as  determined  by Series G's  pro-rata  interest in the net assets of
          each Investment  Fund. All valuations  utilize  financial  information
          supplied  by  each  Investment  Fund  and are  net of  management  and
          performance  incentive  fees  or  other  allocations  payable  to  the
          Investment  Funds'  managers  as  required  by the  Investment  Funds'
          agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager to which the Adviser  allocates
          assets will charge Series G, as investor in an  underlying  Investment
          Fund, an asset-based  fee, and some or all of the Investment  Managers
          will  receive  performance-based   compensation  in  the  form  of  an
          incentive fee. The  asset-based  fees of the  Investment  Managers are
          generally  expected  to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets
          under their management and the incentive fee is generally  expected to
          range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

          As a general  matter,  the fair value of Series G's  investment  in an
          Investment  Fund  represents  the amount that Series G can  reasonably
          expect to receive  from an  Investment  Fund if Series G's  investment
          were redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available
          at the time.  The  Investment  Funds provide for periodic  redemptions
          ranging from monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally  require
          advance notice of a Member's  intent to redeem its interest,  and may,
          depending on the Investment Funds' governing agreements, deny or delay
          a redemption  request.  Series G does not factor into its  valuation a
          liquidity  discount  on any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
          investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
          described  in  each  Investment  Fund's  financial   statements.   The
          Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted
          securities and other investments that are illiquid.

          B.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

          Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Income, expenses and
          realized  and  unrealized  gains and losses are recoded  monthly,  the
          change in an  Investment  Fund's net asset  value is  included  in net
          change in unrealized  appreciation  on investments on the statement of
          operations,  realized gains and losses on withdrawals  from Investment
          Funds are recognized on a cost recovery basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2007 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


          Series G bears all expenses  incurred in the course of its operations,
          including,  but not limited to, the following:  all costs and expenses
          related  to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for  Series  G's
          account; professional fees; costs of insurance; registration expenses;
          and expenses of meetings of the Board of Directors.  Costs incurred in
          connection with the initial  offering were deferred and amortized over
          the first twelve months of  operations;  costs  incurred in connection
          with Series G's subsequent  registration  under the 1933 Act have been
          deferred and were  amortized over the twelve months  commencing  after
          the effective date of such registration statement.

          C.   INCOME TAXES

          Series G operated as a partnership  from inception  through  September
          30, 2005. As of October 1, 2005, Series G became a corporation that is
          taxed as a regulated investment company.

          It is Series G's  intention to meet the  requirements  of the Internal
          Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies (RIC) and
          distribute  substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
          capital  gains,  if any,  to  shareholders  each year.  Therefore,  no
          federal  income or excise tax  provision  is  typically  required  for
          Series G's financial statements.

          D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies invested in money market
          deposit accounts that are accounted for at amortized cost.

          E.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.
          generally accepted accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
          estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  amounts  reported in the
          financial statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
          the estimates  utilized in preparing  Series G's financial  statements
          are reasonable and prudent;  however, actual results could differ from
          these estimates.

     4.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

          In  July  2006,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
          Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -
          an Interpretation  of FASB Statement No. 109" (the  "Interpretation").
          The  Interpretation  establishes for all entities a minimum  threshold
          for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of positions taken
          in filing  tax  returns  (including  whether an entity is taxable in a
          particular   jurisdiction),   and   requires   certain   expanded  tax
          disclosures.   The   Interpretation  is  effective  for  fiscal  years
          beginning  after  December 15, 2006,  and is to be applied to all open
          tax  years  as of the  date of  effectiveness.  The  Adviser  is still
          evaluating   the  impact  this  will  have  on  Series  G's  financial
          statements.

          In September 2006, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting
          Standards  ("SFAS") No. 157,  FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS.  This standard
          establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value sets out a
          framework for measuring fair value and expands  disclosures about fair
          value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value  measurements
          already required or permitted by existing  standards.  SFAS No. 157 is
          effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years beginning
          after  November  15,  2007,  and interim  periods  within those fiscal
          years. As of March 31, 2007, the Adviser does not believe the adoption
          of SFAS  No.  157  will  materially  impact  the  financial  statement
          amounts;  however,  additional  disclosures will be required about the
          inputs  used to  develop  the  measurements  and the effect of certain
          measurements on changes in Members' Capital for the period.

     5.   MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE,  RELATED PARTY  TRANSACTIONS AND
          OTHER

          The Adviser provides certain management and administrative services to
          Series G. The Advisor acts primarily to evaluate and select Investment
          Managers,  to allocate assets,  to establish and apply risk management
          procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall  investment  performance.   In
          addition,  the adviser also  provides  office space and other  support
          services.  In consideration  for such services,  Series G will pay the
          Adviser  a  monthly  management  fee  based on end of  month  Members'
          capital. The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

          Effective August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
          in the  management  fee to 1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.25%
          annually).

          In addition,  the Adviser  allocated certain marketing fees of $19,569
          to Series G during the year ended March 31, 2007.

          Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to assist in the
          placement of Fund Shares. A placement agent will generally be entitled
          to receive a fee from each  investor in the Company  whose  shares the
          agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the  placement  fee paid with
          respect  to a  Member  is  generally  dependent  on  the  size  of the
          investment in a Series.

          Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
          wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. serves as a placement agent
          of the Series G shares. For the year ended March 31, 2007, the Company
          paid $946,795 in placement  fees to CGM on Series G shares.  Such fees
          are deducted from an investor's gross contribution amount.

          The Company has entered into  agreements  with third parties to act as
          additional  placement  agents for Series G shares.  Placement fees may
          range from 0 to 3%. In addition,  the Adviser,  and/or its affiliates,
          will pay the  placement  agents  an annual  fee,  payable  monthly  in
          arrears.  The fee shall be paid from the  Adviser's  own resources (or
          those of its affiliates).

          Prior to  October  1, 2005  Series G paid CAI a monthly  fee of 0.025%
          (0.30% on an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon
          average net assets, subject to a minimum monthly

          fee, and reimbursed certain expenses. CAI, as Administrator,  retained
          PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC"),  an  independent  third  party  and  wholly-owned
          subsidiary  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group,  to  assist in the
          performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  On  October  1,  2005 a
          restructuring  of  this   arrangement  took  affect.   Under  the  new
          arrangement CAI and PFPC have separate agreements with the Company and
          act as co-administrators to the Company. CAI, as co-administrator,  no
          longer receives a monthly fee for their administrative services to the
          Company. PFPC continues to provide certain accounting, record keeping,
          tax and investor related services. Fees for their services are charged
          directly to the Company.

          Each  Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Company,  as
          defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus a
          fee per meeting of the Board of  Directors  of $1,000.  Such  Director
          fees are allocated to each series pro-rata,  based on the relative net
          assets of each series. Any Director who is an "interested person" does
          not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All  Directors
          are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket  expenses.  Total
          amounts  expensed  related to Directors by Series G for the year ended
          March 31, 2007 were $36,090.

          PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
          Series G's assets and provides  custodial  services for Series G. Fees
          payable to the custodian and  reimbursement  for certain  expenses are
          paid by Series G.

          The following  table lists the  aggregate  purchases and proceeds from
          sales of  Investment  Funds for the year  ended  March 31,  2007,  net

     7.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

          Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for shares may be
          accepted as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by
          the Board of  Directors of the Company to accept or reject any initial
          and  additional  subscriptions  for  shares  in Series G. The Board of
          Directors  from  time  to  time  and in  its  complete  and  exclusive
          discretion,  may determine to cause Series G to repurchase shares from
          Members  pursuant  to  written  tenders  by  Members on such terms and
          conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects that it typically  will
          recommend to the Board of Directors that the

     8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

          In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which Series
          G invests trade various  financial  instruments and enter into various
          investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but
          are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts
          and  entering  into  equity  swaps.  Series  G's risk of loss in these
          investment  funds is limited to the value of it's  investment  in such
          funds.

     9.   INCOME TAX INFORMATION

          The tax  components  of  capital  shown in the table  below  represent
          distribution  requirements  Series G must satisfy under the income tax
          regulations,  losses Series G may be able to offset against income and
          gains  realized  in  future  years  and  unrealized   appreciation  or
          depreciation  of securities and other  investments  for federal income
          tax purposes.

</TABLE>

         Net  investment  income  (loss) and net realized gain (loss) differ for
         financial  statement and tax  purposes.  The character of dividends and
         distributions made during the fiscal year from net investment income or
         net realized  gains  differ from their  ultimate  characterization  for
         federal  income tax  purposes.  Also,  due to timing of  dividends  and
         distributions,  the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed differ
         from the  fiscal  year in which  the  income or net  realized  gain was
         recorded by Series G.  Accordingly,  the  following  amounts  have been
         reclassified for March 31, 2007, and are primarily due to the different
         book  to tax  treatment  for  income  derived  from  investment  funds,
         different  book to tax  treatment  for  gains  realized  on the sale of
         investment funds classified as passive foreign investment companies,  a
         distribution reclass,  expenses related to the merger with Series M and
         a federal excise tax paid by the fund that is considered non-deductible
         for federal income tax purposes. Net assets of Series G were unaffected
         by the reclassifications.

- -------------------------
     (1)  As of March 31, 2007,  Series G had $441,833 of post-October  currency
          losses available to offset future ordinary income, if any.

</TABLE>

         The  primary  difference  between  the  book  and tax  appreciation  or
         depreciation of Investment  Funds is attributable to adjustments to the
         tax  basis of  Investment  Funds  based on  allocation  of  income  and
         distributions   from  Investment  Funds  and  the  tax  realization  of
         financial statement  unrealized gain or loss. In addition,  the cost of
         Investment  Funds for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
         of taxable income  allocated  Series G from the Investment  Funds.  The
         allocated  taxable  income is reported  to Series G by each  Investment
         Fund on  Schedule  K-1.  The  aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds for
         federal  income tax  purposes is  therefore  calculated  and  presented
         annually as of March 31. The aggregate cost on Investment Funds and the
         composition of unrealized  appreciation  and depreciation on Investment
         Funds for federal income tax purposes is noted below.

</TABLE>

         Under  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund has elected to
         treat currency  losses  incurred  during the period November 1, 2006 to
         March 31, 2007 of $441,833 as having  incurred in the next fiscal year.
         These losses will be available to offset  future  ordinary  income,  if
         any.

         For the year ended March 31, 2007,  the tax character of  distributions
         paid  by  Series  G was  $13,353,460  ordinary  income  and  $9,293,825
         long-term capital gains.

10.      LOAN PAYABLE

         On  December  27,  2006,  Series G entered  into a Credit and  Security
         Agreement with an unaffiliated bank for a $125,000,000 revolving credit
         facility (the "Credit  Facility").  The Credit Facility will be used in
         connection with investment activities, for cash management purposes, to
         fund the repurchase of shares or for temporary or emergency purposes as
         permitted under the Offering Memorandum. The Credit Facility is secured
         by Series G's assets. At March 31, 2007, the outstanding borrowing from
         the Credit Facility amounted to $16,300,000, bearing interest at a rate
         of 8.25% less a discount percentage per annum.  Interest expense on the
         outstanding  borrowing  for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $684,825,
         with the entire balance payable at March 31, 2007.

                          INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
                                   (UNAUDITED)

         The  Investment   Advisory  Agreement  provides  that  the  Adviser  is
responsible,  subject  to  the  supervision  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  for
formulating a continuing  investment  program for the Series.  The Adviser makes
all  decisions  as to the Series'  purchases  and  withdrawals  of  interests in
Investment Funds and also advises the Board of Directors regarding the selection
and termination of Subadvisers.  The Investment Advisory Agreement is terminable
as to the Series without penalty upon 60 days' prior written notice by the Board
of  Directors,  by vote of a  majority,  as  defined  by the  1940  Act,  of the
outstanding  voting  securities  of the Series,  or by the Adviser upon 60 days'
prior written notice.  The Investment  Advisory Agreement became effective as of
November 1, 2002,  and continues in effect from year to year as to the Series if
the  continuance  is approved  annually by the Board of  Directors  (including a
majority  of the  Independent  Directors)  by vote  cast in  person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such  continuance.  The Investment  Advisory
Agreement  provides  that it will  terminate  automatically  in the event of its
"assignment," as defined by the 1940 Act and the rules under that Act.

         The  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  that, in the absence of
willful  misfeasance,  bad faith,  gross negligence or reckless disregard of its
obligations to the Company or the Series, the Adviser and any partner, director,
officer or  employee  of the  Adviser,  or any of their  affiliates,  executors,
heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives, will not be liable to
the Company or the Series for any error of  judgment,  for any mistake of law or
for any act or  omission by the person in  connection  with the  performance  of
services to the Company or the Series.  The Investment  Advisory  Agreement also
provides for  indemnification,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, by the
Company,  the  Adviser or any  partner,  director,  officer or  employee  of the
Adviser, and any of their affiliates,  executors,  heirs, assigns, successors or
other  legal  representatives,  against  any  liability  or expense to which the
person may be liable that arises in connection  with the performance of services
to the  Company  or the  Series,  so long as the  liability  or  expense  is not
incurred  by  reason of the  person's  willful  misfeasance,  bad  faith,  gross
negligence or reckless disregard of duty.

         The  Investment   Advisory   Agreement  was  approved  by  the  initial
Shareholder  of the Series on November  27,  2002 and by the Board of  Directors
most recently on September 26, 2006. As of the date of this Annual  Report,  the
Board  of  Directors   anticipates  next  considering  the  Investment  Advisory
Agreement before November 2007. In approving the Investment  Advisory  Agreement
in September  2006,  the Board of Directors  considered  the Company's  existing
relationship  with  the  Adviser  and its  affiliates,  as  well as the  ongoing
commitment of the Adviser to the Company.  The  Directors  also  considered  the
Series  investment  performance  to date and the resources and experience of the
Adviser,  its  affiliates  and  the  individuals   dedicated  to  the  Company's
investment program. In this regard, the Directors reviewed materials relevant to
the investment  performance  of the Company and the Adviser,  as well as various
materials describing the Adviser and its personnel. They evaluated these factors
in light of the  nature,  extent and  quality of the  services  provided  by the
Adviser, the total compensation  received,  directly or indirectly (through soft
dollar arrangements or other service benefits, to the extent applicable), by the
Adviser  from the  Company  and the  total  cost to the  Company  of  using  the
Adviser's  services,  taking into account both expenses borne by the Adviser and
those  that may be passed to the  Company  by the  Adviser.  In  addition,  they
compared competitive prices for comparable  services,  reviewing fee information
for a variety of  investment  funds  similar in structure to the Company.  Among
other things, the Directors  determined the Adviser's fees--as reduced effective
August 1,  2005--were  competitive  to  those  charged  by  investment  advisers
to  similar  funds  (when,  if  applicable,  the  fees  charged  to  those other

funds were  adjusted  to reflect the effects of the  incentive  compensation  to
which  certain of those  funds were  subject)  and Series  expense  ratios  were
reasonable given Series net assets. The Directors indicated,  however, that they
would monitor expense ratios over time and would look for reduced expense ratios
as assets grow.  The  Directors  noted that  performance,  while lower than that
targeted,  had  been  satisfactory,  providing  stable  absolute  returns,  that
estimated  profitability  appeared reasonable and that the Adviser's affiliation
with  Citigroup  offered  assurances as to its  institutional  stability.  As to
economies of scale, it was noted that the Company had not yet grown sufficiently
to warrant evaluation of whether benefits relating to its size were being shared
properly between the Adviser and the Shareholders. The Directors also determined
the Adviser's  resources and  experience  were  satisfactory  overall,  and that
sufficient  resources and personnel were assigned to the Adviser's management of
the Company.  Accordingly,  they concluded  continuing  the Investment  Advisory
Agreement served the interests of the Company, the Series and the Shareholders.

</TABLE>
          POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

          As shown in the table  above,  Mr. Nolte is  responsible  for managing
          other  accounts  ("Other  Accounts")  in addition  to the  Series.  In
          certain instances, conflicts may arise in his management of the Series
          and such other Accounts.

          One  situation  where a conflict  may arise  between the Series and an
          Other Account is in the allocation of investment  opportunities  among
          the  Series  and the Other  Account.  For  example,  the  Adviser  may
          determine that there is an opportunity that is suitable for the Series
          as well as for Other  Accounts  of the  Adviser,  which have a similar
          investment  objective.  As a related matter,  a particular  Investment
          Fund interest or other  security may be bought for one or more clients
          when one or more other clients are selling that same  security,  which
          may  adversely  affect the Series.  The  Company and the Adviser  have
          adopted policies and procedures regarding the allocation of investment
          opportunities,  which generally require that investment  opportunities
          be allocated  among the Series and Other  Accounts in a manner that is
          fair,  equitable and consistent  with their  fiduciary  obligations to
          each.

          Mr. Nolte's  management of the Series and Other Accounts may result in
          his devoting a  disproportionate  amount of time and  attention to the
          management  of  a  particular   account  as  against   another.   This
          particularly may be the case when accounts have different  objectives,
          benchmarks, time horizons, asset levels and fees.

          The  management  of personal  accounts  by Mr.  Nolte may give rise to
          potential  conflicts of interest.  While the Adviser's  code of ethics
          will  impose  limits  on the  ability  of Mr.  Nolte to trade  for his
          personal  account,  there is no assurance  that the Adviser's  code of
          ethics will eliminate such conflicts.

          Other than the conflicts  described above, the Company is not aware of
          any material conflicts that may arise in connection with the Adviser's
          management of the Series' investments and such Other Accounts.

  (A)(3)  COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE  OF  PORTFOLIO  MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT  TEAM
          MEMBERS

          Mr. Nolte's  compensation  is a combination  of salary,  discretionary
          bonus,   deferred   compensation,   retirement   plans  and  automatic
          participation in a company-funded  retirement bonus. The discretionary
          bonus is  based  upon  the  financial  results  and  profitability  of
          Citigroup as a whole, that of CAI as a whole, and that of CAI's Global
          Fund of Funds  business  unit,  for  which Mr.  Nolte  serves as chief
          executive. The discretionary bonus is not linked to the performance of
          any specific  benchmark or that of any CAI investment fund or account;
          nor are specific asset size targets considered.

                                   (POLICY 27)

                CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR
               ----------------------------------------------------
                               FINANCIAL OFFICERS
               ----------------------------------------------------


     I.   COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics  (the  "Code")  for the Fund  applies  to its Chief
         Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or
         persons  performing similar functions) (as of August 2005, Ray Nolte as
         President and Jennifer Magro as Treasurer;  each, a "Covered  Officer")
         for the purpose of promoting:

          o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including  the ethical  handling of
               actual or apparent  conflicts  of interest  between  personal and
               professional relationships.

          o    full, fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure in
               reports and  documents  that a company files with, or submits to,
               the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  and in other
               public communications made by the Fund;

          o    compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  governmental  rules  and
               regulations;

          o    prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
               appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

          o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard of business
     ethics and should be sensitive to  situations  that may give rise to actual
     as  well  as  apparent  conflicts  of  interest.  Any  question  about  the
     application  of the Code  should be  referred  to the  Fund's  Chief  Legal
     Officer  (initially  Millie Kim,  General Counsel of the Fund's  investment
     adviser).

     II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
          OF INTEREST

          OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
     private interest  interferes,  or appears to interfere,  with the interests
     of, or his or her service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest
     would  arise  if a  Covered  Officer,  or a  member  of his or her  family,
     receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with
     the Fund.(1)

- -----------------------
(1) Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family relationships,
each  Covered  Officer  should   consider  such  potential   conflicts  and,  if
appropriate,  familiarize  his or her family members with the Covered  Officer's
relevant obligations under this Code.


                                       1

<PAGE>

                                                                       S&S DRAFT

          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
     Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already  are  subject to  conflict  of
     interest  provisions  in the  Investment  Company Act of 1940  ("Investment
     Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers
     Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
     transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property)
     with the Fund because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" (as defined
     in the  Investment  Company Act) of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment
     adviser's  compliance  programs and procedures are designed to prevent,  or
     identify and correct,  violations of these provisions.  This Code does not,
     and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
     and such  conflicts  fall outside the  parameters  of this Code,  unless or
     until the Chief Legal Officer determines any violation of such programs and
     procedures is also a violation of this Code.

          Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
     benefit,  conflicts  may arise  from,  or as a result of,  the  contractual
     relationship  between  the Fund and its  investment  adviser  of which  the
     Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this Code
     recognizes  that the Covered  Officers  will, in the normal course of their
     duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the adviser,  or for both), be
     involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
     different effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation
     of the Covered  Officers in such  activities is inherent in the contractual
     relationship  between the Fund and the adviser and is  consistent  with the
     performance  by the  Covered  Officers  of their  duties as officers of the
     Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  the
     Investment  Company Act and the  Investment  Advisers Act, such  activities
     will  be  deemed  to  have  been  handled  ethically.  In  addition,  it is
     recognized  by the Fund's  Board of  Directors  ("Board")  that the Covered
     Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other  investment
     companies covered by this or other codes.

          Other  conflicts  of interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
     conflicts  of interest  are not  subject to  provisions  in the  Investment
     Company Act and the  Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides
     examples of  conflicts  of interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers
     should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching
     principle is that the personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be
     placed improperly before the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

     o    use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly
          to influence  investment  decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered  Officer  would  benefit  personally  (directly or
          indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund;

     o    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the (direct
          or indirect) individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
          than the benefit of the Fund; or

     o    use material  non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions made or
          contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
          personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

                                                                       S&S DRAFT


          Each Covered  Officer must,  at the time of signing this Code,  report
     all affiliations and significant  business interests outside the Citigroup,
     Inc. corporate group and must update the report annually.

          Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the Chief
     Legal  Officer and, if material,  be  communicated  to the relevant  Fund's
     Board of Directors. Examples of these include:

     o    service as a director on the board of any company;

     o    accepting directly or indirectly,  anything of value,  including gifts
          and  gratuities  in excess of $100 per year from any  person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,  not
          including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting events or
          other  similar   entertainment,   provided  it  is   business-related,
          reasonable  in  cost,  appropriate  as to time and  place,  and not so
          frequent as to raise any question of impropriety.

     o    any   ownership   interest  in,  or  any   consulting   or  employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment  adviser,  principal  placement  agent/underwriter,  or any
          affiliated person thereof;

     o    a direct or indirect  financial  interest in commissions,  transaction
          charges  or  spreads  paid  by  the  Fund  for   effecting   portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

     III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    Each Covered  Officer should  familiarize  himself or herself with the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o    each  Covered  Officer  should not  knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or outside the Fund,  including to the Fund's  Directors and auditors,
          and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate  within his or
          her area of responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees
          of the Fund and its adviser  with the goal of  promoting  full,  fair,
          accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in the  reports and
          documents  the Fund files  with,  or submits  to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Fund; and

     o    it is the  responsibility  of each Covered  Officer to use  reasonable
          efforts to promote  compliance  with the  standards  and  restrictions
          imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

     IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY


                                       3
<PAGE>

                                                                       S&S DRAFT

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code  (thereafter as applicable,  upon becoming a
          Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing to the Board that he or she has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     o    annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he or she has  complied
          with the requirements of the Code;

     o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its  affiliated  persons for reports of  potential  violations
          that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify  the Chief  Legal  Officer  promptly  if he or she knows of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

          The Chief  Legal  Officer is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to
     specific  situations in which  questions are presented under it and has the
     authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.  However, any
     explicit  or  implicit  waivers(2)  sought  by a  Covered  Officer  must be
     considered by the Audit Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

          The Fund will follow these procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
     this Code:

     o    the Chief Legal Officer will take  appropriate  action to  investigate
          any potential violations reported to him or her;

     o    if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes that no
          violation  has  occurred,  the Chief Legal  Officer is not required to
          take any further action,  but will meet with the person  reporting the
          violation  for the purpose of informing  such person of the reason for
          not taking action;

     o    any matter that the Chief Legal Officer  believes is a violation  will
          be reported to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board;

     o    if the Audit  Committee  concurs that a violation has  occurred,  they
          will consider  appropriate  action,  which may include  review of, and
          appropriate  modifications  to,  applicable  policies and  procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
          board;  or a  recommendation  to  dismiss  the  Covered  Officer as an
          officer of the Fund;

     o    the Audit  Committee  will be  responsible  for granting  waivers,  as
          appropriate,   provided  that  waivers  will  be  considered  only  if
          supported  by a written  request  on behalf  of the  relevant  Covered
          Officer  explaining  the basis for such request and how the waiver may
          be implemented  consistent  with the principles  underlying this Code;
          and


- -----------------------
(1) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material  departure  form a  provision  of the code of ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a reasonable period
of time  regarding a material  departure  from a provision of the code of ethics
that has been made known to an executive officer" of the registrant.


                                       4
<PAGE>

                                                                       S&S DRAFT


     o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

          The Audit Committee,  in determining whether waivers should be granted
     or whether  violations  have  occurred,  and the Chief  Legal  Officer,  in
     rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting investigations of
     potential violations under the Code, may, at their discretion, consult with
     such other persons as they determine to be appropriate,  including, but not
     limited to,  another  senior  legal  officer of the Fund or its  investment
     adviser or its affiliates, counsel to the Fund or its investment adviser or
     such  affiliate,  counsel to the  Independent  Directors,  or  (subject  to
     applicable  pre-approval   requirements)   independent  auditors  or  other
     consultants



     V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
     purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
     forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.  Insofar as
     other  policies or procedures of the Fund, the Fund's  investment  adviser,
     principal placement agent/underwriter, or other service providers govern or
     purport to govern the behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who
     are subject to this Code,  they are  superseded  by this Code to the extent
     that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code,  unless any
     provision of this Code conflicts with any applicable  federal or state law,
     in which case the requirements of such law will govern.  The Fund's and its
     investment adviser's and principal placement  agent/underwriter's  codes of
     ethics  under  17j-1  under  the   Investment   Company  Act  are  separate
     requirements that may apply to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
     part of this Code.

     VI. AMENDMENTS

          Any amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority
     vote of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors.

     VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

          All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code
     will be  considered  confidential  and shall be  maintained  and  protected
     accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
     shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the  Independent  Directors and
     their counsel,  the Fund and its counsel and the investment adviser and its
     counsel (and, as relevant, any other person described in the last paragraph
     under "Reporting and Accountability" above).

     VIII. INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended  solely for the internal use by the Fund and does
     not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
     circumstance, or legal conclusion


     I have  read  and  understand  the  terms  of the  Code.  I  recognize  the
     responsibilities  and  obligations  incurred  by me as a result of my being
     subject to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
