NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended,  (the  "Act")  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company  ("Board of Managers").  There are six
         members  of the  Board  of  Managers,  one of  whom  is  considered  an
         "interested person" under the Act. The Company's  investment adviser is
         Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability
         company (the  "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer
         Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of  Oppenheimer & Co.
         Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
         Company's  investment  activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory
         agreement  dated  June  5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member  of the
         Adviser,   and  Alkeon  Capital  Management  L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a
         non-managing member of the Adviser.  Investment  professionals employed
         by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
         portfolio  manager,  manage the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of the
         Adviser under the supervision of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit
         participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to approval by the Board of  Managers.  From January 1, 2004 to
         December  31, 2004,  new Members  were not  accepted  into the Company,
         although  existing Members as of December 31, 2003 were allowed to make
         additional  contributions.  At a meeting held on November 1, 2004,  the
         Board of Managers  approved the acceptance of initial  contributions by
         the Company from new members on or after  January 1, 2005.  The Company
         may from time to time offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
         tenders by Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and on
         such  terms as may be  determined  by the Board of  Managers,  in their
         complete and exclusive  discretion.  The Adviser expects that generally
         it will  recommend to the Board of Managers  that the Company  offer to
         repurchase interests from Members twice each year, effective at the end
         of the second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         a.   REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         b.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i)  Domestic  exchange traded securities (other than options and those
              securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

              (1)  at their  last  composite  sale  prices  as  reported  on the
                   exchanges where those securities are traded; or

              (2)  If no sales of those  securities are reported on a particular
                   day, the securities are valued based upon their composite bid
                   prices for  securities  held long, or their  composite  asked
                   prices for securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported by
                   those exchanges.

         (ii) Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

              (1)  at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is the
                   last trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern Time) adjusted
                   up to NASDAQ's  best offer price if the last traded  price is
                   below such bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best offer price if the
                   last trade is above such offer price); or

              (2)  if no NOCP is available, at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                   prior  to the  calculation  of the  net  asset  value  of the
                   Company; or

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         b.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

              (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

              (4) if no sale is shown and no bid price is  available,  the price
                  will be deemed  "stale"  and the value will be  determined  in
                  accordance  with  the  fair  valuation  procedures  set  forth
                  herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         b.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         C.   CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly-liquid  financial instruments that mature
         within three months at the time of purchase as cash equivalents.

         D.   INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes on
         the  profits of the  Company is made as the  Members  are  individually
         liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

         The  Company  has  reclassified  ($6,303,566)  and  ($15,588,707)  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized loss on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2004.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         loss on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

         During the six months ended June 30, 2005,  Oppenheimer earned $105,662
         as brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf
         of the Company.  Mainsail Group,  L.L.C., a broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,   earned  $352,839  as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the six months
         ended June 30, 2005, an Incentive  Allocation of $2,362 was credited to
         the Special Advisory Member's capital account.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  Any
         Manager who is an  "interested  person"  does not receive any annual or
         other fee from the Company.  Managers who are not "interested  persons"
         are reimbursed by the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to
         the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
         recordkeeping, tax and investor related services. The Company pays PFPC
         an accounting and investor  services fee based primarily on the average
         net  assets of the  Company as of the last day of each  month,  payable
         monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its discretion.  For the six months ended June 30, 2005,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $2,000.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, amounted
         to $781,075,517 and $793,013,915, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2004,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $458,276,845, and $120,297,270, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2004,  accumulated net
         unrealized  depreciation on investments  was $2,166,571,  consisting of
         $22,746,492   gross  unrealized   appreciation  and  $24,913,063  gross
         unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet purchased,  net of unsettled  trades,  and excess cash, held at the
         prime broker as of June 30, 2005.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  As of and for the six  months  ended  June  30,  2005,  the
         Company had no outstanding margin borrowings.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include options and
         securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,   these  financial
         instruments  represent  future  commitments  to  purchase or sell other
         financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates. Each
         of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of off-balance
         sheet  risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the  securities
         underlying  the financial  instruments  may be in excess of the amounts
         recognized  in  the  statement  of  assets,  liabilities  and  members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

      7. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets, liabilities and members' capital.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the
         premium  is added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
         security in  determining  whether  the  Company has  realized a gain or
         loss.  In writing an option,  the  Company  bears the market risk of an
         unfavorable change in the price of the security or index underlying the
         written  option.  Exercise of an option  written by the  Company  could
         result in the Company selling or buying a security at a price different
         from the current market value.  As of and for the six months ended June
         30, 2005, there were no transactions in written options.

III.  APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting held on April 22,  2005,  the Board of Managers of the Company (the
"Board") completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's   investment   advisory  agreement  with  the  Adviser.   The  process
culminating  in  the  annual  approval  included:  a  number  of  in-person  and
telephonic meetings among Board members,  management and counsel;  the formation
and  operation  of a  contract  review  committee  consisting  of members of the
Company's Board and the boards of other registered and unregistered domestic and
foreign funds advised by Oppenheimer affiliates;  joint, coordinated information
requests by committee  members and counsel  focused on areas of common  interest
and  concern;  meetings  with senior  management  of  Oppenheimer  in which they
expressed  the  firm's  commitment  of  financial  and  other  resources  to the
investment  advisory  business  generally and to the registered  funds platform,
which  includes the Company,  including a commitment  that any operating  losses
incurred in connection with Oppenheimer's  advisory business would not adversely
affect the quality of the services provided to the Company; and consideration of
the  Company's  advisory  arrangements  in the  context of the  Adviser  and its
affiliates' overall business.

In approving the renewal of the advisory agreement, the Board, including each of
the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written  materials  provided by the
Adviser at the request of the Board and  assessed:  (i) the  nature,  extent and
quality of the services provided to the Company; (ii) the investment performance
of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii) advisory fees and other
fees and  expenses of the Company  (including  fee and expense  information  for
comparable  funds) and the  profitability of the Adviser and its affiliates with
respect to its relationship with the Company; (iv) the extent to which economies
of scale would be

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

realized  as the  Company  grows;  and (v)  whether  fee  levels  reflect  these
economies  of scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also  approved the
renewal  of the  administrative  services  agreement  between  the  Company  and
Oppenheimer,  an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In  considering  the nature,  extent and  quality of  services  that the Adviser
provides  to the  Company,  the Board  reviewed  presentations  from  management
relating  to  staffing,  management  and  compensation  of  personnel  providing
services to the  Company,  employee  structure  and  compensation.  In addition,
Independent  Managers met with senior management of Oppenheimer to discuss these
and other  matters  relevant to their  deliberations.  The Board also reviewed a
written  business plan requested from management and also reviewed  management's
budget plans for the coming year with respect to resource allocations. The Board
also  considered the extent,  if any, to which lower advisory fee revenues might
adversely  affect  services  provided to the Company.  The Board  considered the
implications to the Company of the third-party hedge fund platform  developed by
Oppenheimer  and its  potential  effect  on the  distribution  of and  marketing
services  for the  Company,  and  reviewed  current  marketing  efforts  for the
Company.

Based on its review,  the Board  concluded  that the Company  benefits  from the
services provided by the Adviser,  including  research and portfolio  management
services  and  benefits  from  the   administrative   services  and   compliance
infrastructure  provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer.  The Board noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, extent and quality of services provided by
the Adviser and concluded  that the Company was receiving the services  required
from the Adviser under its agreement  with the Company,  and that these services
were of appropriate quality.

In connection with its consideration of the investment advisory  agreement,  the
Board reviewed materials relating to the Company's  investment  performance on a
quarterly  basis.  The Board  considered  the  Company's  historical  investment
performance,  including a comparison of such  performance to the  performance of
similar  funds and relevant  indices.  Although the  performance  of the Company
varied from quarter to quarter,  and the Company did not always  outperform such
funds and indices, the consensus of the Board was that, since the acquisition of
the CIBC asset  management  business by Oppenheimer  and over the long term, the
performance of the Company has been satisfactory,  although volatile.  The Board
also concluded that management is making appropriate  efforts toward the goal of
improving the Company's investment performance.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services  provided by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer
under the investment  advisory agreement and administrative  services agreement,
respectively.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's
fees and expenses to those of comparable  registered  funds,  and concluded that
the  Company's  fees and expenses  are similar to those of the other funds.  The
Board also considered  revenues received by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from the
Company,  including  fees and  incentive  allocations,  if any,  as well as data
regarding the Adviser's  financial  condition,  compensation and  profitability,
including related direct and indirect operating expenses relating to the Company
and payments made to registered representatives of Oppenheimer for services they
provide to investors.  The Board reviewed the methodology used to estimate these
costs, as set

                                      -23-

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

forth in the profitability materials provided by management.  It also considered
the indirect benefits received by the Adviser and its affiliates attributable to
their  relationships  to the Company.  Although the Board noted that the Adviser
and  Oppenheimer  generally  were not  currently  realizing  a profit from their
relationships with the Company,  the Adviser's  continued  willingness to manage
the Company and  Oppenheimer's  willingness to support the Adviser's  operations
evidenced their commitment to providing quality services to the Company.

In connection with the Board's  assessment of the  profitability  of the Adviser
and its  affiliates,  the  Board  considered  that a  portion  of the  brokerage
commissions  paid by the  Company are used to obtain  research-related  services
that may benefit the  Adviser.  The Board also  recognized  that the Adviser and
Oppenheimer  support  the  distribution  of  interests  in the Company by making
direct payments from their own resources to financial advisors of Oppenheimer in
connection with investor-related services.

Based on its review of  information  relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the  profitability  of the Adviser and its  affiliates,  the Board concluded
that  the  Company's   fees  under  the   investment   advisory   agreement  and
administrative services agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the services
provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer,  and  concluded  that the  Company's
advisory fees and expenses were within industry norms.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated with services  provided to the Company,  the Board concluded that, as
economies of scale are predicated on increasing  levels of assets,  economies of
scale are not being  realized at the present  time  because  there have been net
outflows of capital from the Company.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

 1. the nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided by the Adviser are
adequate and appropriate;

 2.  the fees to be paid to the  Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  are  reasonable  and
appropriate in light of  comparative  expense and advisory fee  information  and
benefits  to  be  derived  by  the  Adviser  and  its   affiliates   from  their
relationships with the Company;

 3. the Adviser's  fees are  reasonable in light of the advisory fees charged by
the  Adviser  and other  investment  advisers  to  similar  investment  vehicles
receiving  similar  services,  and  in  light  of  the  fact  that,  absent  any
performance  allocation,  the expenses associated with providing services to the
Company  have  exceeded,  and may  continue to exceed,  the fees  payable by the
Company;

 4. in light of a declining level of Company assets over the past several years,
economies  of scale are not being  realized  by the  Adviser or  Oppenheimer  at
current asset levels; and

 5. the approval of the renewal of the Company's  investment  advisory agreement
for an additional  annual period is in the best interests of the Company and its
members.

                            OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT



I, Bryan McKigney, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Advantage Advisers Xanthus
         Fund, LLC;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed
              under our supervision,  to provide reasonable  assurance regarding
              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
