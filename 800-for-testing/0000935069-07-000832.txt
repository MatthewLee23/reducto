                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2007
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2007, the Fund had a total return of 10.36%.(1)
For the period from commencement of operations on August 21, 2002 through
January 31, 2007, the Fund had an average annual total return of 8.38%.

This was an extraordinarily strong year for a majority of our arbitrage
managers, and is particularly notable given that volatility remained muted. Our
event managers had an especially good year and our fixed income managers
performed well, while our short-biased credit managers struggled with a credit
market in which spreads narrowed even further. Below, we discuss some of the
major sub-strategies in the Fund.

This past year represented the first in many when merger arbitrage produced
strong returns. Aided by the most robust Mergers and Arbitrage ("M&A") market in
history with $3.8 trillion of global volume, our managers took a selective
approach in choosing deals. Particularly fruitful were transactions with higher
spreads, which typically involved more complex circumstances such as unsolicited
and cross-border activity. In fact, 2006 represented the largest year ever for
cross-border activity with European consolidation in the energy (E.ON/Endesa),
power (Iberdrola/Scottish Power), and industrial (Mittal/Arcelor) sectors. With
deal volumes building throughout 2006 and the fourth quarter the largest ever
for announced M&A, we see a healthy opportunity set for this strategy in 2007.

Our Asian convertible arbitrage manager continued to produce attractive returns
by pursuing a traditional hedged strategy in geographies where convertibles are
priced less efficiently for structural reasons. Although implied volatilities
increased only modestly in 2006, the spread between realized and implied
volatility remained healthy for much of the year, which aided returns. In
addition, some yield curve strategies benefited as the anomalies they had
identified in the shape of the forward curve corrected over the course of the
first half of the year.

                                                                               1

                                   (Unaudited)

Our managers have also enhanced their strategies where appropriate and
complementary to an existing skill set. For instance, one manager has been able
to construct credit-neutral arbitrage positions on structured product
instruments by finding tranches that are mispriced. Given the enormous size of
the structured product market and relative lack of arbitrageurs, we are not
surprised that such opportunities exist and feel that such a strategy is a
useful addition to an absolute return portfolio. Even better, opportunities such
as these will probably become better should the markets in which they trade
become stressed, as natural buyers will be scarce and few hedge funds will have
sufficient expertise to provide liquidity.

            Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2007
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want to or be able to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must estimate the value of the claims he is buying, the
likely timing and resolution of the bankruptcy process and also may be called
upon to reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2007, the Fund had a total return of 12.95%.(1)
For the period from commencement of operations on August 21, 2002 through
January 31, 2007, the Fund had an average annual total return of 13.23%.

Our expectation of weakening fundamentals and rising defaults proved premature
in 2006. Corporate earnings continued to surge, with double digit growth in
earnings for the S&P 500 for the fifth straight year. At the same time, defaults
remain near all time lows as weaker companies are able to refinance their way
out of jams. Given the limited supply of defaulted credits as well as the
cautious approach of our managers, we are quite pleased with the results our
managers were able to generate in 2006. Firms in the auto sector continued to
make progress on their restructuring plans. In addition, many managers' legacy
positions, some of which have transitioned to equity, benefited from the
attractive macroeconomic climate.

LBO activity and continued pressure by shareholders to return capital are
leading corporate managements to re-lever their balance sheets, with net
corporate borrowing (non-financial) returning to late 1990's levels. The result
has been a record level of buybacks and special dividends in the past year.
Ultimately, certain of these companies with unstable cash flows which decided to
increase leverage to an extreme should provide good opportunities for our
distressed managers.

                  Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2007
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2007, the Fund had a total return of 9.61%.(1)
For the period from commencement of operations on August 21, 2002 through
January 31, 2007, the Fund had an average annual total return of 8.25%.

The late summer rally in the equity markets gained steam during the fourth
quarter as positive economic data combined with lower long-term interest rates
emboldened investors. The year as a whole was the best since 2003, with all
major global markets, save Japan, clocking double digit returns. Japan's poor
performance was perhaps the biggest surprise of the year. Although the economy
continued to recover, it failed to accelerate as many had expected, popping the
country's small cap growth bubble (Japan's Mothers Index was down 56% for 2006)
while larger cap names treaded water. Another surprise was that 2006 did not
mark the return of large cap dominance; instead, small cap stocks outperformed
by 3.5%.

While our long/short managers certainly benefited somewhat from the rising tide
of the equity markets, with this portfolio averaging only 38% net long, a
significant portion of the return can be attributed to superior stock selection.
Many of our managers had gains in 2006 from sizeable positions in companies they
had held for a significant amount of time. In the case of one manager, they had
made an investment in a metal producer in 2005 when this company was trading at
a cash flow yield north of 7%. As the manager gained confidence in the position,
it was increased to 8% of their portfolio and has subsequently added nine
percentage points to the fund's cumulative return.

On the short side, our managers generally proved adept at avoiding the landmines
that private equity takeouts represent. The environment of moderating growth in
the U.S. presented significant opportunities on which many of our managers were
able to capitalize. One of the most impressive performances of the year was no
doubt by our short-only manager; the fact that they were flat during this year's
powerful bull market is quite remarkable. They generated significant alpha in
homebuilders, consumer finance and consumer discretionary names. This
performance helped significantly lower the downside volatility of the portfolio,
especially in May when this fund was up over 7% percent while the S&P 500 was
down 3%.

                Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2007
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
capital among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market
neutral strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund contains managers that attempt to create long and short portfolios that
are roughly equal in size and therefore immune to overall stock markets
movements. Often these strategies are quantitative in nature, using computer
screens to pick long and short portfolios of stocks and balancing their risk
exposure through optimization techniques.

For the year ended January 31, 2007, the Fund had a total return of 3.68%.(1)
For the period from commencement of operations on August 21, 2002 through
January 31, 2007, the Fund had an average annual total return of 2.84%.

While the returns proved steady, we continue to be disappointed with the
performance of this Fund. Ultimately, we believe the real value of a market
neutral allocation will be experienced during times of high volatility when the
Fund can serve as ballast to a portfolio, muting the volatility experienced by
allocations with higher equity and credit biases. June of this past year was
just such an example: while the other four strategy funds were flat to down for
the month as the equity markets swooned, the Fund generated 1.24%.

The long-term opportunity set for market neutral managers has become
increasingly challenging, even more so than for other absolute return
strategies. As ever more capital has flowed into this strategy, factors that
used to generate alpha have dissipated away. Success is increasingly dependent
upon building an extensive and rigorous research process that resembles a
university research laboratory. We are examining several candidates who model
their firms in this way and who are developing an investment process that
exploits a number of time horizons.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2007
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of opportunistic
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
smaller-sized, more idiosyncratic portfolios employing directional strategies or
focusing on particular markets or sectors.

For the year ended January 31, 2007, the Fund had a total return of 2.41%.(1)
For the period from commencement of operations on May 27, 2005 through January
31, 2007, the Fund had an average annual total return of 4.38%.

As mentioned in prior letters, we have been frustrated by the mediocre returns
for the Fund. Much of the underperformance of the Fund can be attributed to the
short credit positions which have suffered significantly as the credit markets
rallied this year. While the short credit investment currently makes the fund
look worse from a returns perspective, in the context of a portfolio it seems a
sensible tactical bet that should provide significant benefits when the credit
cycle turns.

Nevertheless, we have been diligently examining the Fund and seeking ways to
improve its performance. We are having success in identifying talented stock
pickers operating under the radar of other long/short managers whom we are
enthusiastic about adding to the portfolio. We have also selectively trimmed a
few positions from the Fund.

On the plus side, there were a number of significant positive contributions by
our smaller, more nimble managers. One manager, with assets under $500 million,
took advantage of its lean size during the year by focusing on only three new
opportunities in the small cap space. These investments included a U.K.
furniture manufacturer, a regional U.S. chicken producer and a snack food
distributor. The firm's small asset size enables it to focus on under-researched
small cap companies, occasionally becoming actively involved in corporate
governance. Our energy-focused long/short manager also continued to produce
double-digit returns, as a number of its investments in the upstream E&P sector
rallied and its Canadian natural gas production companies were able to meet
their drilling schedules. These types of investments epitomize the type of
under-researched companies that the Fund managers uncover through a
research-intensive approach.

             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Managers and Members of the Aetos Capital Funds:

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos
Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Fund, LLC (hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at January 31, 2007, the
results of each of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended, and
the changes in each of their members' capital for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for the periods presented (except
for the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC whose changes in members' capital
and financial highlights are shown for the year ended January 31, 2007 and for
the period May 27, 2005 (commencement of operations) through January 31, 2006),
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of the underlying
portfolio funds at January 31, 2007, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC,
Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Fund, LLC valued at $384,147,314 (85.8% of the Fund's members'
capital), $102,566,471 (93.3% of the Fund's members' capital), $732,639,134
(99.2% of the Fund's members' capital), $112,158,484 (97.9% of the Fund's
members' capital), and $125,173,697 (89.5% of the Fund's members' capital)
respectively, at January 31, 2007, the values of which have been estimated by
the Investment Manager, under general supervision of the Board of Managers, in
the absence of readily ascertainable market values. Those estimated values may
differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
market for the investments existed, and the difference could be material.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                January 31, 2007

1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (collectively the "Funds" and
individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of Delaware as limited liability
companies. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
companies. Each of the Funds is a fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital
appreciation by allocating their assets among a select group of private
investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds) ("Portfolio Funds") that
utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies specific for each Fund to
produce an attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent
of the various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes. Aetos
Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of January 31,
2007 the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 71%, 68%, 70%, 68% and 79% for the Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Cayman Fund and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.


                                                                              24

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current



                                                                              25

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

market exchange and the differences could be material to the financial
statements. The use of different factors or estimation methodologies could have
a significant effect on the estimated fair value.

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

Costs incurred with the initial registration and offering of Interests in the
Opportunities Fund totaling $45,093 were deferred and were amortized over a
period of one year, commencing with operations. As of January 31, 2007, such
costs have been fully amortized.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant. Such
withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.




                                                                              26

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E.  Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.

F.  Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2007.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.




                                                                              27

<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $25,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $2,500 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,500. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques, including
leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a
high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to
achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio
Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The
Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.



                                                                              28

<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK (CONTINUED)

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

6.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

For the year ended January 31, 2007, purchases and sales of investments were as

7. INVESTMENTS

As of January 31, 2007, collectively the Funds had investments in forty-four
Portfolio Funds, none of which were related parties. The following table lists
the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds as of January 31, 2007. The agreements
related to investments in Portfolio Funds provide for compensation to the
general partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.0% to 2.0% (per
annum) of the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net
profits earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with
lock-up provisions ranging from 3 months to 2 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after any applicable lock-up
provisions.

9. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES". This
standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-return
positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the
more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than
50 percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of the
first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. At adoption, companies must
adjust their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are
more-likely-than-not to be sustained as of the adoption date. Management
continues to evaluate the application of the Interpretation to the Funds, and is
not in position at this time to estimate the significance of its impact, if any,
on the Funds' financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 157, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS." This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Funds' financial statement
disclosures.

ITEM 7.   DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                       AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

I.        INTRODUCTION

          This policy sets forth Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("AAM")
          policies and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio
          securities held in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary
          investment management services and for which AAM has the explicit
          authority to vote their proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if
          necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting
          issues as they arise.

          As an investment manager for various clients, including clients
          governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
          amended ("ERISA"), AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to
          manage, acquire and dispose of client account assets, unless the
          "named fiduciary" for an ERISA account has explicitly reserved the
          authority for itself, or in the case of an account not governed by
          ERISA, the

<PAGE>

          client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will
          vote proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make
          voting decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its
          ERISA plan clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all
          relevant factors and without undue influence from individuals or
          groups who may have an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy
          vote. In fulfilling its obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a
          manner it deems prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance
          the economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held in its
          clients' accounts.

II.       ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

          AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
          on matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided
          that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract
          from the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
          accounts. These matters are set out below:

          (i)     Appointment or election of auditors;
          (ii)    Routine elections or re-elections of directors;
          (iii)   Director's liability and indemnification;
          (iv)    General updating/corrective amendments to charter;
          (v)     Name changes;
          (vi)    Elimination of cumulative voting; and
          (vii)   Elimination of preemptive rights.

III.      ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

          A.      AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of
                  management initiatives which may have a substantive financial
                  or best interest impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion,
                  approval of such initiatives will not detract from the
                  economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
                  accounts. These matters are set out below:

                  (i)      Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes
                           of stock and voting rights;
                  (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization for stock
                           splits, stock dividends, and other specified needs
                           which are no more than 50% of the existing
                           authorization;
                  (iii)    Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not
                           less than 85% of fair market value;
                  (iv)     Stock option plans that are incentive based and not
                           excessive;
                  (v)      Other stock-based plans which are appropriately
                           structured;
                  (vi)     Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and
                  (vii)    Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

          B.      AAM will generally not vote in support of management on
                  certain issues which have a potential substantive financial or
                  best interest impact when AAM believes that approval of the
                  proposal may negatively impact the economic value of the
                  company's securities held in AAM client accounts. These
                  matters are set out below:

                  (i)      Capitalization changes which add classes of stock
                           which are blank check in nature or that dilute the
                           voting interests of existing shareholders;
                  (ii)     Changes in capitalization authorization where
                           management does not offer an appropriate rationale or
                           that are contrary to the best interest of existing
                           shareholders;
                  (iii)    Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to
                           prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                           their rights or effectively deter appropriate tender
                           offers and other offers;
                  (iv)     Amendments to by-laws which would require
                           supermajority shareholder votes to pass or repeal
                           certain provisions;
                  (v)      Classified boards of directors;
                  (vi)     Reincorporation into a state which has more stringent
                           anti-takeover and related provisions;

<PAGE>

                  (vii)    Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate
                           offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                           trigger provisions which prevent legitimate offers
                           from proceeding;
                  (viii)   Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation
                           related proposals;
                  (ix)     Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                           compensation plans, employment contracts and
                           severance agreements that benefit management and
                           would be costly to shareholders if triggered; and
                  (x)      "Other business as properly comes before the meeting"
                           proposals which give a blank check to those acting as
                           proxy.

IV.       SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

          AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
          matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such
          matters, usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party
          analyses of these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in
          our view negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will
          oppose it.

V.        CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

          Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
          interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
          conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy
          of disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
          before voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting
          guidelines if the application of the guidelines to the matter do not
          involve the exercise of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using
          the recommendations of an independent third party.

VI.       PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

          AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
          procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf
          of clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting
          information; and (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM
          that were material in making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the
          above-mentioned records for a minimum of five years.

VII.      PROXY ADMINISTRATION

          AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
          positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and
          oversees the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief
          Investment Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel,
          analyzes types of proposals based on whether they would adversely
          affect shareholder's interests and make a company less attractive to
          own. In evaluating proxy proposals each year, the Committee relies
          upon our own knowledge of each company and its management, independent
          research provided by third parties, and information presented by
          company managements and shareholder groups.

          Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are
          distributed to AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines.
          Ultimately, the investment professional primarily accountable for a
          portfolio is responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio.
          Most vote consistent with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will
          take an independent view on certain issues and vote differently. When
          an investment professional casts votes which are counter to the
          Committee's guidelines, they are required to document their reasons in
          writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of Managers of the AAM
          Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies, and voting
          records.

collective trusts, or offshore funds. The Investment Manager manages

<PAGE>

potential conflicts between funds or with other types of accounts through
allocation policies and procedures, internal review processes, and oversight by
directors and independent third parties. The Investment Manager has developed
trade allocation procedures and controls to ensure that no one client,
regardless of type, is intentionally favored at the expense of another.
Allocation policies are designed to address potential conflicts in situations
where two or more funds or accounts participate in investment decisions
involving the same securities.

DESCRIPTION OF COMPENSATION

Professionals employed by the Investment Manager are subject to a compensation
structure that includes base salary and a discretionary bonus. Bonuses are

Individuals that consistently exceed performance objectives are eligible for
promotions and/or equity participation in the firm. Officers are also eligible
to share in the net profits of the business under a profit participation plan.
Participation amounts are determined on the basis of performance and
contribution. In addition, all managing directors of the Investment Manager have
a common equity membership in Aetos Capital, LLC.

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR COVERED OFFICERS OF
       INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and  collectively,  the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer  ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives  Management,  LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing  integrity of financial  reporting and  transactions.  The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.     SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole  code of ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for  purposes  of
Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  Insofar  as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies  and  procedures  that govern the  conduct of all of Aetos'  employees,
including the Covered Officers,  such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles,  policies and procedures  conflict with
the  provisions  of this Code.  The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the  "Investment  Company Act")
are separate  requirements  applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this  Code.  In  addition  to this Code or any other  code of ethics
previously  adopted by Aetos,  the  Investment  Company  Act and the  Investment
Advisers  Act of 1940 (the  "Advisers  Act") and  rules  promulgated  thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching.  Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment  Company Act or Advisers Act  provisions  or the rules  thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.    REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

       1.     Engage in and promote  honest and ethical  conduct,  including the
              ethical  handling  of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest
              between personal and professional relationships;

       2.     Act responsibly in producing and produce,  full,  fair,  accurate,
              timely,  and  understandable  disclosure  in reports and documents
              that the  Funds  file  with,  or submit  to,  the  Securities  and
              Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
              made by the Funds;

       3.     Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;

       4.     Promptly  report  suspected  material  violations  of  this  Code,
              including  violations of securities laws or other laws,  rules and
              regulations applicable to the Funds, to Aetos' General Counsel and
              the Audit Committee; and

       5.     Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity,  including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos'  policies,  and place the  interests  of the Funds  before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.


<PAGE>


Each Covered  Officer is required to  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others,  including,  but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds,  and their  respective  independent  managers,  independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and
employees  of the  Funds  and  Aetos  with the  goal of  promoting  full,  fair,
accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made
by the Funds.

It is the  responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III.   AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The  overarching  principle  of this Code is that the  personal  interests  of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict  of  interest in an ethical  manner;  (ii) not use his or her  personal
influence  or  personal  relationships  to  influence  investment  decisions  or
financial  reporting  by a  Fund  whereby  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
personally  (directly or  indirectly)  to the  detriment of the Fund;  (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the  Covered  Officer  rather  than the  benefit of such Fund;  and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.    COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow  certain  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing this
Code,  including,  but not limited to, the  following:  (i) all  violations  and
potential  violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General  Counsel of Aetos will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
potential  violations;  (iii) if the General Counsel of Aetos  determines that a
