INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

May 26, 2005

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We present you with the annual report for Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.
(the "Fund") for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

Below you will find information regarding the Fund's performance and an
interview with the Fund's portfolio manager. After these sections, you will find
additional information regarding investment policy changes. These changes will
permit greater flexibility in investing a portion of the Fund's investments.
These changes do not modify the Fund's policy to invest at least 80% of its net
assets in insured municipal obligations under normal circumstances.

PERFORMANCE

Over the 12-month period, the Fund's net asset value return was 2.48%. On a
market price basis, the Fund declined 6.55%. Over the same period, the Fund's
peer group, the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) median's net
asset value and market price returns were 3.03% and -3.92%, respectively.
Finally, the Fund's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers U.S. Municipal Bond Index
(the "Index"), returned 2.67%. (For more performance information, please refer
to "Performance At A Glance" on page 7). As the market price for both the Fund
and the median of its peer group moved down while net asset values appreciated,
discounts widened during the period.

The Fund continued to use leverage during the period, which was 40% of total
assets as of March 31, 2005. Leverage can magnify returns on the upside and on
the downside, and the degree of leverage used can create wider dispersions of
returns within the Fund's peer group.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER WILLIAM VERONDA

Q. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A. The US economy faced a number of challenges during the reporting period,
   including record high oil prices, rising interest rates, a mixed job market,
   uncertainty surrounding the presidential election and geopolitical events.
   Despite these issues, the economy proved to be surprisingly resilient.

   gain in the second quarter of 2004, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was a
   robust 4.0% in the third quarter and 3.8% in the fourth quarter. Preliminary
   estimates for first quarter 2005 GDP growth were 3.5%

Q. HOW DID THE FED REACT TO THESE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS?

A. Given the strength of the economy, it became increasingly clear that the
   Federal Reserve Board's (the "Fed") accommodative monetary policy would
   change and it would begin to raise interest rates in an attempt to ward off a
   potential increase in inflation. As expected, the Fed raised the federal
   funds rate (or "fed funds" rate)--the rate that banks charge one another for
   funds they borrow on an overnight basis--from 1.00% in June 2003 to 1.25% at
   the end of June 2004. This was the first rate hike in four years.

   The Fed raised rates in 0.25% increments on six more occasions over the
   fiscal year, bringing the fed funds rate to 2.75% by the end of March 2005.
   Toward the end of the period, the Fed appeared to become increasingly
   concerned about inflation. Coinciding with the March rate hike, the Fed
   continued to say it expected to raise rates at a "measured" pace. However, it
   also said that inflationary pressures "have picked up in recent months and
   pricing power is more evident," whereas in February it stated that inflation
   was "well contained." Many market participants believed this telegraphed the
   potential for rate hikes larger than 0.25% in the future. The Fed did indeed
   raise rates again after the period closed, bringing the rate to 3.0%.

Q: HOW DID YOU POSITION THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO DURING THE FISCAL YEAR?

A: Given our expectation that yields would rise in concert with the Fed's
   tightening cycle, the Fund's duration was shorter than the benchmark during
   the fiscal year. While this led to mixed results over the period, our yield
   curve positioning generally enhanced results over the reporting period. We
   expected the yield curve to flatten, whereby the gap between short- and
   long-term yields narrows, and so we maintained a barbell strategy for the
   portfolio. In doing so, we held relative overweights in both short-term and
   longer-term securities. In the second half of the fiscal year, this was
   coupled with an underweight in the 2- to 8-year portion of the curve. This
   positioning proved to be beneficial for results as longer-term securities
   performed well and the 2- to 8-year segment of the yield curve lagged the
   overall market.

   During the period, we received approval from the Fund's Board of Directors to
   invest up to 20% of the portfolio in non-insured municipal obligations that
   are rated at least BBB by S&P or Baa by Moody's. We believe that this will
   bring the Fund into closer alignment with its peer group, and expect it will
   provide us with the flexibility to invest in securities that offer the
   opportunity to generate incremental income. More details regarding these
   changes are provided on page 6.

<Page>

Q: COULD YOU DESCRIBE SOME NEW PURCHASES MADE FOR THE FUND OVER THE PERIOD?

A: In the fourth quarter of 2004, we added New Jersey Economic Development
   Authority bonds, which have a 5.0% coupon and mature in 2009. We found this
   issue, secured by the pledge of cigarette taxes in the state, to be
   attractively priced. While New Jersey faces a significant deficit in 2005, we
   believe the bonds are well-secured given the state's high per capita income
   and diversified economy.

   A good example of how we employed the barbell strategy for the portfolio was
   our addition of both Sacramento Sanitation District bonds, offering a 5.0%
   coupon and maturing in 2035, and San Diego California Unified School District
   bonds, offering a 5.0% coupon and maturing in 2029. We found these securities
   to be attractively valued, and they benefited as the yield curve flattened.
   We subsequently sold these holdings, as we felt they became richly valued.

Q: WHICH AREAS DID YOU EMPHASIZE FROM A REGIONAL STANDPOINT?

A: We focused on states that we believed were exhibiting improved fiscal health
   and whose municipal bonds were attractively valued. For example, throughout
   the period we emphasized securities from the California tax-exempt market.
   Following its financial crisis in 2003, California's fiscal situation has
   seen considerable improvements. Our overweight position in California
   enhanced results as the state's bonds continued to outperform the overall
   market during the year. Given this appreciation, we believe California
   municipal securities are now fairly valued given their underlying fundamental
   risks.

Q: WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS OF THE HEALTHCARE AND TOBACCO SECTORS?

A: Given an environment of declining government reimbursements, we were negative
   on the healthcare sector in general. However, as the period progressed we
   selectively purchased certain hospital bonds that we believed offered yields
   that fairly compensated investors for their risks. This strategy proved
   beneficial for the Fund. We continued to avoid tobacco settlement bonds, as
   we maintained our negative long-term outlook for the sector. This positioning
   detracted from results over the period, as these more speculative tobacco
   bonds performed well.

Q: WHICH SECTORS DID YOU EMPHASIZE OVER THE FISCAL YEAR?

A: The Fund's portfolio is highly diversified and is exposed to a wide variety
   of sectors. Having said that, one area that we found attractive was the
   airport sector. Unlike the troubled airline industry, airports have performed
   well as the economy has improved. Both business and consumer flight trends
   have surpassed their pre-September 11, 2001 levels.

                                        3
<Page>

   An example of a holding in this area was Metropolitan Washington (DC)
   Airports Authority bonds, which offer a 5.25% coupon, mature in 2016, and are
   also subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Although the Fund has
   always been able to invest in AMT bonds, historically it has not done so.
   During the fiscal year, we informed the Board of our intention to begin
   purchasing these bonds where appropriate. As with the added flexibility to
   invest in BBB/Baa bonds, investing in AMT bonds also brings the Fund into
   closer alignment with its peer group. This should provide us the opportunity
   to invest in securities that generate additional incremental income.

Q: CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN AFFECT THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO?

A: As of March 31, 2005, 40% of the Fund was leveraged. This means that the Fund
   had "borrowed" money by issuing preferred shares. While leverage can increase
   the Fund's short-term volatility, we believe it better positions us to seek
   our goal of generating high current income that is exempt from federal income
   tax, consistent with the preservation of capital.

Q. HOW WAS THE FUND POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR?

A. At this point, it appears US economic growth will be sustainable, despite the
   increase in oil prices. In particular, consumer spending has remained solid,
   and corporate capital expenditures appear to be improving. In terms of the
   Fund's portfolio, we expect to remain defensively positioned and to continue
   to employ a barbell positioning structure. We will continue to look for
   opportunities where individual securities appear to be structurally
   mispriced, and focus on states with improving balance sheets whose bonds are
   attractively valued.

INVESTMENT POLICY CHANGES

The Fund's Board of Directors has approved a change in investment policies to
permit greater investment flexibility. One of the Fund's investment policies has
permitted investment of up to 20% of its portfolio in non-insured municipal
obligations meeting certain criteria, including (i) non-insured municipal
obligations that are rated at least AAA by Standard & Poor's, a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), Aaa by Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
("Moody's"), or have received an equivalent rating from another nationally
recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), and (ii) non-insured
municipal obligations that are guaranteed by an entity rated at least AAA by
S&P, Aaa by Moody's, or an equivalent rating from another NRSRO.

The Fund's Board of Directors has approved a change that will permit the Fund to
invest up to 20% of its portfolio in non-insured municipal obligations that are
rated at least BBB by S&P, Baa by Moody's, or an equivalent rating from another
NRSRO, or that are guaranteed by an entity rated at least BBB by S&P, Baa by
Moody's, or an equivalent rating from another NRSRO. The investment policy has
also been revised to provide that all non-insured municipal obligations invested
in by the Fund be rated at least BBB by S&P, Baa by Moody's, or the equivalent
rating by another NRSRO. ("AAA" or "Aaa" is considered the highest rating
category, while "BBB" or "Baa" is considered below the highest category but
still investment grade.) The revised investment policies are expected to become
effective on or after June 1, 2005. As a result, the Fund's 80% investment
policy and 20% investment policy would be revised to read as follows:

   Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets
   in Insured Municipal Obligations, the income from which is exempt from
   regular federal income tax. "Insured Municipal Obligations" are Municipal
   Obligations that are insured as to the timely payment of both principal and
   interest by an entity, that, at the time of investment, has a claims-paying
   ability rated Aaa by Moody's, AAA by S&P or an equivalent rating by another
   NRSRO. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in Municipal
   Obligations that are not insured but that are, at the time of investment, (1)
   backed by an escrow or trust account containing sufficient US government or
   US government agency securities to ensure the timely payment of principal and
   interest; (2) guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by an
   entity which has a credit rating of Baa by Moody's, BBB by S&P or an
   equivalent rating by another NRSRO; or (3) not insured, guaranteed or backed
   by escrows but rated at least Baa by Moody's, BBB by S&P or an equivalent
   rating by another NRSRO. The Municipal Obligations described in (1) and (2)
   above may be unrated if they are determined by the investment advisor to be
   of comparable quality to Municipal Obligations that have received ratings of
   at least Baa by Moody's, BBB by S&P, or an equivalent rating by another
   NRSRO.

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income tax,
consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that the
Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

In the normal course of business the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations or that provide indemnification for certain
liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not
yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Fund's management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates net asset values based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use last reported
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). The amortized cost method of valuation, which
approximates market value, generally is used to value short-term debt
instruments with sixty days or less remaining to maturity, unless the Board
determines that this does not represent fair value. Securities traded in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") market are valued at the last bid price available on
the valuation date prior to valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is

                                       24
<Page>

recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

FUTURES CONTRACTS--Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is
required to deposit in a segregated account with its custodian, in the name of
the futures broker through which the transaction was effected, an amount of cash
and/or municipal obligations equal to a certain percentage of the contract
amount. This amount is known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments, known
as "variation margin" are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on
the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial futures
contracts. Such variation margin is recorded for financial statement purposes on
a daily basis as unrealized gain or loss until the financial futures contract is
closed, at which time the net gain or loss is reclassified to realized gain or
loss on futures. Variation margin calls could be substantial in the event of
adverse price movements.

Using financial futures contracts involves various market risks. If the Fund was
unable to liquidate a futures position due to the absence of a liquid secondary
market or the imposition of price limits, it could incur substantial losses. The
Fund would continue to be subject to market risk with respect to the position.
In addition, the Fund would continue to be required to make variation margin
payments and might be required to maintain the position being hedged or to
maintain cash or securities in a segregated account. Furthermore, certain
characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with
movements in the prices of the investments being hedged, including temporary
price distortion.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders at a level rate that over time will result in the distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend rate on the common
stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund.
Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued daily.
The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions from net
realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.

                                       25

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM"), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator
of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management
subsidiary of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization with
headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland and operations in many areas of the
financial services industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract, the Fund
pays UBS Global AM an investment advisory and administration fee, which is
accrued weekly and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred
shares. Prior to August 1, 2004, UBS Global AM had agreed to waive 0.20% of the
advisory and administration fee, so that the Fund's effective fee was 0.70% of
average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred
shares from July 23, 2003 until July 31, 2004. Effective August 1, 2004, the
Fund's management fee waiver increased to 0.30%, reducing the effective
management fee to 0.60%. This waiver will continue indefinitely unless the Board
agrees to any change. At March 31, 2005, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $266,137,
which is $399,018 investment advisory and administration fees less fees waived
of $132,881. For the year ended March 31, 2005, UBS Global AM waived $1,391,596
in investment advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMPENSATION TO AFFILIATE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Effective March 1, 2005, Professor Meyer Feldberg accepted the position of
senior advisor to Morgan Stanley, resulting in his becoming an interested
director of the Fund. The Fund has been informed that Professor Feldberg's role
at Morgan Stanley does not involve matters directly affecting any UBS funds.
UBS Global AM executes Fund portfolio transactions through Morgan Stanley based
on that firm's ability to provide best execution of the transactions. During the
year ended March 31, 2005, the Fund purchased and sold certain securities (e.g.,
fixed income securities) in principal trades with Morgan Stanley having an
aggregate value of $102,776,738. Morgan Stanley received compensation for these

                                       26
<Page>

trades in the form of a "mark-up" or "mark-down" of the price of the securities.
Although the precise amount of this compensation is not generally known by UBS
Global AM, UBS Global AM believes that under normal circumstances it represents
a small portion of the total value of the transactions.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of auction preferred shares Series A, 800 shares
of auction preferred shares Series B, 800 shares of auction preferred shares
Series C, 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series D, 600 shares of auction
preferred shares Series E and 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series F
which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." All shares of each
series of APS have liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount
equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for each
Series of APS. Dividend rates ranged from 0.750% to 2.600% for the year ended
March 31, 2005.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

Offering expenses of $723,487 were charged to paid-in-capital of the Fund in
connection with the offering of APS during the year ended March 31, 2004.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the year ended March 31, 2005, aggregate purchases and sales of portfolio
securities, excluding short-term securities, were $232,355,785 and $234,279,819,
respectively.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no

                                       27
<Page>

provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income, net
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005 and March 31, 2004 were as follows:

At March 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis were as
follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                            <C>

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</Table>

The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation of
investments and futures is attributable to the realization for tax purposes of
unrealized gains/losses on certain securities that were marked-to-market and
premium amortization adjustments.

For federal income tax purposes, the tax cost of investments and the components
of net unrealized appreciation of investments at March 31, 2005 were as follows:

<S>                                                            <C>
Tax cost of investments                                        $  512,517,866
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gross unrealized appreciation                                  $    6,841,871

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</Table>

To reflect reclassifications arising from permanent "book/tax" differences for
the year ended March 31, 2005, the Fund's undistributed net investment income
was increased by $157,289 and accumulated net realized loss from investments and
futures was increased by $157,289.

These differences are primarily due to reclassification of dividends and premium
amortization adjustments.

(1)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a $10,000 purchase of common
     stock at the current market price on the first day of each year reported
     and a sale at the current market price on the last day of each year
     reported, and assuming reinvestment of dividends and other distributions to
     common shareholders at prices obtained under the Fund's Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage
     commissions. Returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
     shareholder could pay on Fund distributions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ERNST & YOUNG LLP

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Insured
Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments,
as of March 31, 2005, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets applicable to common shareholders
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. at March 31, 2005, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets applicable to
common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

management investment company whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE"). The Fund's investment objective is to achieve a high level of current
income that is exempt from federal income tax, consistent with the preservation
of capital. The Fund's investment advisor and administrator is UBS Global Asset
Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global AM"), an indirect wholly owned asset
management subsidiary of UBS AG, which had approximately $50.7 billion in assets
under management as of March 31, 2005.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "PIF." Comparative net asset value and market
price information about the Fund is published weekly in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,
THE NEW YORK TIMES and BARRON'S, as well as in numerous other publications.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND RECORD

You may obtain a description of the Fund's proxy voting policies and procedures
(and information regarding how the Fund voted any proxies related to portfolio
securities during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2004), without charge, upon
request by contacting the Fund directly at 1-800-647-1568, online on the Fund's
Web site: www.ubs.com/ubsglobalam-proxy, or on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's
Web site (http://www.sec.gov).

QUARTERLY FORM N-Q PORTFOLIO SCHEDULE

The Fund will file its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the first and third quarters of
each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Forms N-Q are available on the SEC's
Web site at http://www.sec.gov. The Fund's Forms N-Q may be reviewed and copied
at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the
operation of the SEC's Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling
1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, you may obtain copies of Forms N-Q from the Fund
upon request by calling 1-800-647-1568.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") under
which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names, or
in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have all
dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock automatically
reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such common shareholders
elect to receive cash. Common shareholders who elect to hold

                                       31
<Page>

their shares in the name of another broker or nominee should contact such broker
or nominee to determine whether, or how, they may participate in the Plan. The
ability of such shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if their
shares are transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time. Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should include the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the
share certificate or in the transfer agent's records. An election to terminate
participation in the Plan, until such election is changed, will be deemed an
election by a common shareholder to take all subsequent distributions in cash.
An election will be effective only for distributions declared and having a
record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is received.

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend payable
to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including applicable
brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in the open
market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in connection
with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for reinvesting
dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However, each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with respect to any
dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution. The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence,
Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

         (a)  AUDIT FEES:
              For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, the
              aggregate Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) audit fees for professional
              services rendered to the registrant were approximately $37,300 and
              $45,650, respectively.

              Fees included in the audit fees category are those associated with
              the annual audits of financial statements and services that are
              normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory
              filings.

         (b)  AUDIT-RELATED FEES:
              In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and March 31,
              2004, the aggregate audit-related fees billed by E&Y for services
              rendered to the registrant that are reasonably related to the
              performance of the audits of the financial statements, but not
              reported as audit fees, were approximately $12,500 and $15,618,
              respectively, which includes amounts related to non-audit services
              prior to May 6, 2003 that would have been subject to pre-approval
              if the SEC rules relating to the pre-approval of non-audit
              services had been in effect at that time.

              Fees included in the audit-related category are those associated
              with (1) the reading and providing of comments on the 2004 and
              2003 semiannual financial statements, (2) review of the
              consolidated 2003 and 2002 report on UBS Funds' profitability of
              UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global AM") to assist
              the board members in their annual advisory/administration contract
              reviews and (3) auction preferred shares testing for the
              registrant's fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004.

              There were no audit-related fees required to be approved pursuant
              to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the
              fiscal years indicated above.

         (c)  TAX FEES:
              In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and March 31,
              2004, the aggregate tax fees billed by E&Y for professional
              services rendered to the registrant were approximately $2,600 and
              $9,700, respectively, which includes amounts related to tax
              services prior to May 6, 2003 that would have been subject to
              pre-approval if the SEC rules relating to the pre-approval of
              non-audit services had been in effect at that time.

              Fees included in the tax fees category comprise all services
              performed by professional staff in the independent accountant's
              tax division except those services related to the audits. This
              category comprises fees for review of tax compliance, tax return
              preparation and excise tax calculations.

              There were no tax fees required to be approved pursuant to
              paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the
              fiscal years indicated above.

         (d)  ALL OTHER FEES:
              In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and March 31,
              2004, there were no fees billed by E&Y for products and services,
              other than the services reported in Item 4(a)-(c) above, rendered
              to the registrant.

              Fees included in the all other fees category would consist of
              services related to internal control reviews, strategy and other
              consulting, financial information systems design and
              implementation, consulting on other information systems, and other
              tax services unrelated to the registrant.

              There were no "all other fees" required to be approved pursuant to
              paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the
              fiscal years indicated above.

                  Reproduced below is an excerpt from the charter regarding
                  pre-approval policies and procedures:

                           The [audit ]Committee shall:

                           ...


                           2.  Pre-approve (a) all audit and permissible
                               non-audit services(1) to be provided to the Fund
                               and (b) all permissible non-audit services to be
                               provided by the Fund's independent auditors to
                               UBS Global [AM] and any Covered Service
                               Providers, if the engagement relates directly to
                               the operations and financial reporting of the
                               Fund. In carrying out this responsibility, the
                               Committee shall seek periodically from UBS Global
                               [AM] and from the independent auditors a list of
                               such audit and permissible non-audit services
                               that can be expected to be rendered to the Fund,
                               UBS Global [AM] or any Covered Service Providers
                               by the Fund's independent auditors, and an
                               estimate of the fees sought to be paid in
                               connection with such services. The Committee may

                               delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any
                               such audit and permissible non-audit services to
                               a sub-committee consisting of the Chairperson of
                               the Committee and two other members of the
                               Committee as the Chairperson, from time to time,
                               may determine and appoint, and such sub-committee
                               shall report to the Committee, at its next
                               regularly scheduled meeting after the
                               sub-committee's meeting, its decision(s). From
                               year to year, the Committee shall report to the
                               Board whether this system of pre-approval has
                               been effective and efficient or whether this
                               Charter should be amended to allow for
                               pre-approval pursuant to such policies and
                               procedures as the Committee shall approve,
                               including the delegation of some or all of the
                               Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to
                               other persons (other than UBS Global [AM] or the
                               Fund's officers).

                               ----------
                                    (1) The Committee will not approve non-audit
                                    services that the Committee believes may
                                    taint the independence of the auditors.
                                    Currently, permissible non-audit services
                                    include any professional services (including
                                    tax services) that are not prohibited
                                    services as described below, provided to the
                                    Fund by the independent auditors, other than
                                    those provided to the Fund in connection
                                    with an audit or a review of the financial
                                    statements of the Fund. Permissible
                                    non-audit services may NOT include: (i)
                                    bookkeeping or other services related to the
                                    accounting records or financial statements
                                    of the Fund; (ii) financial information
                                    systems design and implementation; (iii)
                                    appraisal or valuation services, fairness
                                    opinions or contribution-in-kind reports;
                                    (iv) actuarial services; (v) internal audit
                                    outsourcing services; (vi) management
                                    functions or human resources; (vii) broker
                                    or dealer, investment adviser or investment
                                    banking services; (viii) legal services and
                                    expert services unrelated to the audit; and
                                    (ix) any other service the Public Company
                                    Accounting Oversight Board determines, by
                                    regulation, is impermissible.

                                    Pre-approval by the Committee of any
                                    permissible non-audit services is not
                                    required so long as: (i) the aggregate
                                    amount of all such permissible non-audit
                                    services provided to the Fund, UBS Global
                                    [AM] and any service providers controlling,
                                    controlled by or under common control with
                                    UBS Global [AM] that provide ongoing
                                    services to the Fund ("Covered Service
                                    Providers") constitutes not more than 5% of
                                    the total amount of revenues paid to the
                                    independent auditors (during the fiscal year
                                    in which the permissible non-audit services
                                    are provided) by (a) the Fund, (b) its
                                    investment adviser and (c) any entity
                                    controlling, controlled by, or under common
                                    control with the investment adviser that
                                    provides ongoing services to the Fund during
                                    the fiscal year in which the services are
                                    provided that would have to be approved by
                                    the Committee; (ii) the permissible
                                    non-audit services were not recognized by
                                    the Fund at the time of the engagement to be
                                    non-audit services; and (iii) such services
                                    are promptly brought to the attention of the
                                    Committee and approved by the Committee (or

                                    the audit.

         (h)  The registrant's audit committee was not required to consider
              whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
              the registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser
              whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted
              with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity
              controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
              investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
              registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph
              (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
              maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee (the "Audit
Committee") established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee is comprised of the
following board members: Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Beaubien, Mr. Burt and Mr. White.

ITEM 6.  SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Included as part of the report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant's Board of Directors believes that the voting of proxies on
securities held by the registrant is an important element of the overall
investment process. As such, the Board has delegated the responsibility to vote
such proxies to the registrant's advisor. Following is a summary of the proxy
voting policy of the advisor.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY, VOTING GUIDELINES AND POLICY SUMMARY

The proxy voting policy of UBS Global AM is based on its belief that voting
rights have economic value and must be treated accordingly. Generally, UBS
Global AM expects the boards of directors of companies issuing securities held
by its clients to act as stewards of the financial assets of the company, to
exercise good judgment and practice diligent oversight with the management of
the company. While there is no absolute set of rules that determines appropriate
corporate governance under all circumstances and no set of rules will guarantee
ethical behavior, there are certain benchmarks, which, if substantial progress
is made toward, give evidence of good corporate governance. UBS Global AM may
delegate to an independent proxy voting and research service the authority to
exercise the voting rights associated with certain client holdings. Any such
delegation shall be made with the direction that the votes be exercised in
accordance with UBS Global AM's proxy voting policy.

When UBS Global AM's view of a company's management is favorable, UBS Global AM
generally supports current management initiatives. When UBS Global AM's view is
that changes to the management structure would probably increase shareholder
value, UBS Global AM may not support existing management proposals. In general,
UBS Global AM (1) opposes proposals which act to entrench management; (2)
believes that boards should be independent of company management and composed of
persons with requisite skills, knowledge and experience; (3) opposes structures
which impose financial constraints on changes in control; (4) believes
remuneration should be commensurate with responsibilities

<Page>

and performance; and (5) believes that appropriate steps should be taken to
ensure the independence of auditors.

UBS Global AM has implemented procedures designed to identify whether it has a
conflict of interest in voting a particular proxy proposal, which may arise as a
result of its or its affiliates' client relationships, marketing efforts or
banking and broker/dealer activities. To address such conflicts, UBS Global AM
has imposed information barriers between it and its affiliates who conduct
banking, investment banking and broker/dealer activities and has implemented
procedures to prevent business, sales and marketing issues from influencing our
proxy votes. Whenever UBS Global AM is aware of a conflict with respect to a
particular proxy, its appropriate local corporate governance committee is
required to review and agree to the manner in which such proxy is voted.

ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Form N-CSR disclosure requirement not yet effective with respect to the
registrant.

ITEM 9.  PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

There were no purchases made by or on behalf of the registrant or any
"affiliated purchaser," as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of shares of the registrant's equity
securities made in the period covered by this report.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

The registrant's Board has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider
nominees recommended by shareholders if a vacancy occurs among those board
members who are not "interested persons" as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In order to recommend a nominee, a
shareholder should send a letter to the chairperson of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, Richard R. Burt, care of the Secretary of the
registrant at UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc., 51 West 52nd Street, New
York, New York 10019-6114, and indicate on the envelope "Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee." The shareholder's letter should state the
nominee's name and should include the nominee's resume or curriculum vitae, and
must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election
if nominated for the Board and to serve if elected by shareholders.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

   (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
        officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and
        procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act
        of 1940, as amended) are effective based on their evaluation of these
        controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing date
        of this document.

        officer are aware of no changes in the registrant's internal control
        over financial reporting that occurred during the
