FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:                                               FEBRUARY 2005

Compared to other years in the recent past, two thousand four was a rather
tranquil period for domestic equity markets. In fact, it would be entirely
correct to call it an "average year," as the S&P 500 Index returned 10.9
percent--precisely its average annualized return dating back 15 years to 1989.
Equity investors remember all too well the roaring market of the late 1990s, the
bear market of 2000-2002 and the strong rebound of 2003. In that light, a less
volatile, relatively uneventful year may have been exactly what investors
needed.

     The fact that the stock market drifted for most of the year is not entirely
surprising, as there was a distinct lack of catalysts to move it in one
direction or the other. Indeed, most of the year was a matter of watching and
waiting--chiefly for the presidential election. Once that issue was resolved,
stocks advanced sharply, posting a 9.2 percent advance (in the S&P 500 Index) in
the closing quarter, which represented the lion's share of the full-year return.

     As the table below demonstrates, Liberty All-Star Equity Fund fully
participated in the market's positive performance during 2004, topping its
primary benchmark, the Lipper Large-Cap Core Mutual Fund Average, and the S&P
500 Index.

     While we are pleased that the Fund outperformed, it is even more gratifying
to note its relative rank among peer funds in the Lipper Large-Cap Core Mutual
Fund universe. The Fund ranked in the fourth percentile for the fourth quarter
and in the fifth percentile for the full year, meaning that it outperformed 96
and 95 percent of funds with similar investment objectives for the quarter and
year, respectively. The table on the next page traces Fund performance over the
long term. The good performance in 2004 supports the Fund's multi-management
objective: a core equity holding offering greater consistency of returns in
support of above-average long-term performance.

     To reiterate my thoughts from last year's Annual Report insofar as these
short- and long-term tables are concerned, I believe they capture the Fund's
underlying strengths. Its structure as a closed-end, multi-managed fund provides
shareholders with access to institutional quality investment managers and
exposure to the two primary equity investment styles, growth and value.
Management and ongoing monitoring by the Fund manager, Liberty Asset Management
Company (LAMCO), ensure alignment with shareholder interests and that the
investment managers are performing up to expectations. A more detailed
description of the Fund's unique attributes may be found in this Annual Report's
feature section, which immediately follows this letter. I encourage you to
review it.

     Returning to 2004, it was a year of few surprises, and for every bit of
good news there seemed to be an offsetting negative. As mentioned, the
presidential election in effect neutralized the stock market for three quarters,
leaving the S&P 500 Index just about flat through nine months (+1.5 percent
through September 30). Another newsworthy item was the Federal Reserve reversing
its highly accommodative monetary policy by hiking its target Fed funds rate
five times beginning in June, raising that key short-term rate from 1.0 percent
to 2.25 percent. Those hikes have had relatively little impact on financial
markets, as the Fed had been carefully telegraphing its intentions, so as not to
catch investors off guard. The dollar has fallen--thus far in an orderly manner,
mitigating the potential for a sharp sell-off in dollar denominated assets.

     Higher cost oil extracted its measure of pain--a barrel of crude moving
close to $56 in October--but inflation, while at its highest since 2000,
remained quiescent (+3.3 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index). In
addition, key economic indicators suggest continued growth in consumer and
corporate spending. Iraq remains a painful reminder of the world that we live
in, but terrorist actions--except for events such as the tragic bombings in
Spain and Russia--were muted.

     On the corporate front, earnings topped out in the first quarter, but to an
extent that was to be expected after the unsustainably strong recovery in 2003.
By the time fourth quarter figures are tallied, earnings should be up about 20
percent for the year. The energy, utility and telecom sectors were the best
performers among the 10 sectors that make up the S&P 500 Index, while the
sectors that lagged were health care, information technology and consumer
staples.

OFFICERS OF LIBERTY ALL-STAR EQUITY FUND, FROM LEFT: FRED H. WOFFORD, VICE
PRESIDENT - OPERATIONS; WILLIAM R. PARMENTIER, JR., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER; AND MARK T. HALEY, CFA, VICE PRESIDENT - INVESTMENTS.

     Of significance to investors in Liberty All-Star Equity Fund, value stocks
once again outperformed growth stocks. In fact, value has now topped growth for
the fifth straight year. The outperformance of value stocks during the past five
years is in reaction to and in sharp contrast to the single-minded focus
investors had for growth stocks in the late 1990s. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund
was structured from its inception as a core equity holding by combining both
value- and growth-oriented managers within one fund. By doing so, it avoids the
need to anticipate these shifts in style leadership, the magnitude and timing of
which are so unpredictable.

     The growth/value relationship is just one of many topics discussed in this
year's Manager Roundtable. It is rare that investors have the opportunity to
hear from managers who clearly represent different styles and strategies in one
place. Thus, I urge you to read the Roundtable, beginning on page 12, as I
believe it sheds further light on market trends and the managers' thinking.

     In summary, we are very pleased that the Fund outperformed once again. In
reference to 2004, I said in my letter to shareholders a year ago that "A sound
if unspectacular year may be in investors' best long-term interests," and that's
exactly what we got. That said, it is unusual for the stock market to put
together back-to-back average years. I don't know what will happen in 2005, but
it will surely be interesting to follow events.

     Whatever happens, you can be assured that your team here at LAMCO remains
vigilant and dedicated to serving shareholders' best long-term interests. We are
pleased with our progress over the years, and look forward confidently to the
future. As always, we are grateful for your ongoing support of the Fund.


Sincerely,

/s/ William R. Parmentier

FUND FUNDAMENTALS

[GRAPHIC]

Multiple Managers

Large institutional investors--pension funds, endowments and foundations, for
example--employ multiple portfolio managers to make investment decisions. These
large investors establish investment policy and objectives, and then retain
well-qualified investment managers to implement the policy according to their
guidelines.

     Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is managed in much the same way. The Fund's
advisor, Liberty Asset Management Company (LAMCO), allocates the Fund's assets
among three value style managers and two growth style managers. Typically, value
style managers focus on companies with attractive prospects that trade at
comparatively low multiples of sales, earnings and book value. Growth managers
concentrate on companies with high expected sales and earnings growth that are
often leaders in expanding sectors of the economy. Why multiple managers with
differing styles? Because allocating assets across several carefully selected
managers with complementary investment styles diversifies the portfolio, can
lower risk over the long term and produce more consistent investment performance
through changing market cycles.

AS ADVISOR TO THE ALL-STAR EQUITY FUND, LIBERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY
(LAMCO) ADDS VALUE FOR INVESTORS BY PRACTICING A WELL-DEFINED AND DISCIPLINED
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS. LAMCO BRINGS OBJECTIVITY, EXPERIENCE AND
EXPERTISE TO CONSTRUCTING AND MONITORING A MULTI-MANAGED PORTFOLIO, AND IS
DEDICATED TO THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF FUND SHAREHOLDERS.

Exchange Traded

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is a closed-end investment company with a fixed
number of shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and on other
exchanges. By contrast, open-end mutual funds create and redeem shares
continuously as money flows into or out of the fund and are not traded on stock
exchanges.

     In recent years, closed-end, exchange-traded funds have become increasingly
popular because they offer several advantages to investors. Taking Liberty
All-Star Equity Fund as an example, Fund shares are bought and sold just like
those of other publicly traded companies. The price of a share is determined by
supply and demand and pricing is continuous--not just end-of-day, as is the case
with open-end funds. Fund shares trade frequently, there are no annual sales
fees and expense ratios are often lower than many open-end funds. While many
exchange-traded funds are passive investments whose return is based on the
performance of an index, Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is actively managed by its
five investment managers. From their perspective, the Fund's closed-end
structure is advantageous because they have the confidence of knowing they will
not experience sharp inflows or outflows of assets and are thus able to focus on
the long-term investment merits of their portfolio.

Alignment and Objectivity

Alignment with shareholders' best interests and objective decision-making are
two fundamental principles to which LAMCO, the Fund's advisor, is dedicated. A
constant focus on these two standards helps to ensure that all the myriad
decisions involved in the management of the Fund are made openly and equitably.
The Fund's goal is better and more consistent long-term total returns for its
shareholders, which LAMCO pursues by combining investment managers with
different styles and strategies.

     A series of checks and balances ensures the integrity of that goal. There
are no in-house loyalties or external alliances to stand in the way. The Fund is
governed by an independent Board of Trustees that is elected by and responsible
to the shareholders. The Fund's five investment managers are retained by the
Fund, but make independent buy and sell decisions. They know, however, that
LAMCO monitors their performance and their adherence to their value or growth
style, and will replace them if such action is warranted. In addition, the LAMCO
officers involved in day-to-day management of the Fund are incented to act in
investors' best interests because they too are shareholders and a portion of
their compensation is tied to Fund performance.

Institutional Quality

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is intended to bring institutional quality
investing to individual investors. Multi-management is one strategy large
institutions use to manage their portfolios that the Fund brings to individual
investors. There are several others, however.

     One is manager quality. All-stars are proven performers in their field...a
select group that stands apart. Since its founding in 1986, Liberty All-Star
Equity Fund has sought investment managers who meet its rigorous criteria. LAMCO
selects investment management firms for the Fund after an extensive review of
their background and track record, including the firm's investment philosophy,
process, people and performance. As investors in any type of fund have learned,
manager selection is perhaps THE critical decision. The managers LAMCO retains
for the Fund principally serve institutional clients and are generally not
accessible to individual investors. The Fund's institutional size and
professional reputation can provide shareholders with access to these leading
managers.

     LAMCO overlays another level of quality. There are thousands of investment
management firms from which to choose, and their long-term investment
performance varies widely. In researching and retaining managers, LAMCO calls on
the expertise of its professional staff, state-of-the-art analytical tools and
years of experience in the investment field. Similarly, LAMCO's continuous
monitoring ensures that managers meet expectations once they have been retained.

                                        7

Monitoring and Rebalancing

Two significant phases of ongoing Fund management are monitoring and
rebalancing. These are disciplines that individual investors should
practice--but often don't, owing to a lack of time or expertise. LAMCO adds
value for Fund shareholders by performing both.

     Monitoring is a continuous process in which LAMCO routinely reviews the
investment managers. Constant vigilance is required to ensure that each
portfolio manager is performing as expected. Investment returns are closely
watched, but are not the only factor that is monitored. We analyze the Fund's
investment managers' trading activity and the characteristics of their portfolio
holdings to confirm that they are adhering to their strategy and performing well
compared to their peers. We watch for changes in firm ownership and key
personnel because they introduce new decision-makers. Market pressures may lead
a manager to deviate from its investment style and strategy. If warranted by
such events, LAMCO will replace a manager, an action that has occurred 13 times
during the Fund's 18-year history.

     Periodic rebalancing maintains the Fund's structural integrity and is a
well-recognized investment discipline. Owing to shifting market sentiment and
their differing styles and strategies, the investment managers will perform
differently over time. This can unbalance the intended composition of the Fund's
investment portfolio. When this happens, LAMCO "locks in" profits by taking
assets from the outperforming managers and giving them to those whose style and
strategy have temporarily lagged. While this seems counterintuitive, it is
really a case of taking money from today's winners and redeploying it among
tomorrow's.

Quarterly Distributions

Since 1988, the Fund has followed a policy of paying annual distributions on its
shares at a rate of 10 percent of the Fund's net asset value (paid quarterly at
2.5 percent per quarter), providing a systematic mechanism for distributing
funds to shareholders. Because a portion of the portfolio is turned over when an
investment manager is replaced (often generating realized capital gains), the
Fund's multi-management investment approach and the payout policy complement one
another.

     Recognizing the diverse needs of the Fund's shareholders, the Fund also
offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Some investors
prefer their dividends in the form of cash. Others reinvest their dividends in
additional Fund shares, thus letting their dividends compound over time. The
Cash Purchase feature allows shareholders to make additional investments in the
Fund on a monthly basis. The Fund rounds out its services for shareholders by
providing a range of tools, such as a Web site at www.all-starfunds.com;
communications, such as monthly updates and quarterly reports; and investor
assistance via toll-free telephone at 1-800-LIB-FUND.

MULTI-MANAGEMENT HAS PRODUCED MORE CONSISTENT RETURNS

The narrative on the preceding six pages is intended to focus on the unique
attributes of the Fund. This chart demonstrates the long-term outcome of these
attributes, particularly the Fund's multi-management structure. Most mutual
funds are run by a single portfolio manager or an internal team of managers
pursuing a particular investment style, whether it's growth or value. But styles
go in and out of favor. A style that outperforms on a relative basis one year
may disappoint the next, leading to higher volatility. As discussed in our Fund
Fundamentals feature, LAMCO utilizes multi-management, that is, combining
managers who practice different investment styles to reduce volatility while
producing competitive returns.

     All-Star's long-term track record provides clear testimony to the value of
the multi-management strategy. The chart below demonstrates that since
All-Star's first full calendar year of operation 18 years ago, the Fund has
achieved better-than-average returns and better-than-average consistency
compared with peer funds in the Lipper Large-Cap Core universe.

[GRAPHIC]

Each dot represents the precise 18-year return and consistency record ending
December 31, 2004, of each fund in the universe of 53 open-end Large-Cap Core
equity mutual funds (as classified by Lipper, Inc.) that has an 18-year history.

   Consistency is measured by the volatility of "non-market" monthly returns,
calculated by subtracting the return of the S&P 500 Index from each mutual
fund's return. The lower the volatility, the higher the consistency of results
compared with the stock market.

MANAGER ROUNDTABLE

FROM THEIR GROWTH OR VALUE PERSPECTIVE, THE MANAGERS LOOK BACK AT 2004 AND AHEAD
AT FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT 2005

THE S&P 500 INDEX RETURNED 10.9 PERCENT LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS IN THE GENERAL
RANGE OF ITS HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF 8 TO 10 PERCENT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE
YEAR WAS AVERAGE, AS IT TOOK A STRONG FOURTH QUARTER TO TURN A FLAT YEAR INTO A
GOOD ONE. LOOKING AHEAD, INVESTORS ARE TRYING TO SIFT THROUGH A RANGE OF
CONFLICTING DATA AND OPINIONS TO DISCERN THE STEERING CURRENTS THAT WILL GUIDE
THE STOCK MARKET IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.

Continuing a tradition, the Fund's manager, Liberty Asset Management Company
(LAMCO), recently had the opportunity to moderate another annual roundtable with
the Fund's five investment managers. From their respective points of views, the
managers summarize their style and strategy and then analyze the investment
environment before concluding with comments on a stock they have added recently
to the portion of the All-Star Equity Fund portfolio that they manage. The
participating investment managers and their styles are:

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS INTERVIEW REPRESENT THE MANAGERS' VIEWS AT THE TIME
OF THE DISCUSSION (JANUARY 2005) AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Frank Mastrapasqua, Ph.D.,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
INVESTMENT STYLE/Growth - Mastrapasqua uses proprietary screens, in-house
research and direct contact with managements to select growth companies with
compelling valuations. Mastrapasqua focuses on companies with proven competitive
advantage and profitability records. A proprietary risk-adjusted
price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio is computed and compared to an
independently derived long-term earnings growth rate. Companies selected for
investment have projected growth rates that exceed the risk-adjusted
price-to-earnings ratio.

MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS, INC.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/David A. Katz, CFA,
President and Chief Executive Officer
INVESTMENT STYLE/Value - Matrix follows an opportunistic value-oriented
investment philosophy. Matrix believes that value can be found in all sectors of
the economy, and thus looks for investment opportunities beyond traditional
value industries. The firm employs a systematic and rigorous investment
process--using both quantitative and qualitative analysis--and adheres to a
strict sell discipline.

PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/A. Rama Krishna, CFA,
Managing Principal
INVESTMENT STYLE/Value - Pzena uses fundamental research and a disciplined
process to identify good companies that the firm believes are undervalued on the
basis of current price to an estimated normal level of earnings. Companies in
the portfolio have a sustainable business advantage and a sound business plan to
restore earnings to normal.

SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION

PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Arnold C. Schneider, III, CFA,
President and Chief Investment Officer
INVESTMENT STYLE/Value - Schneider practices a disciplined fundamental approach
to add value over time. Research focuses on uncovering new ideas in the belief
that the broader market is slow to react to change, particularly where
out-of-favor stocks are concerned. Owning these stocks before they experience a
rebound in earnings and come to the attention of other investors creates the
opportunity for price appreciation before fundamentals warrant the stock be
sold.

"WE ANALYZE INVESTMENTS USING OUR PROPRIETARY SCREENS, IN-HOUSE RESEARCH AND
DIRECT CONTACT WITH COMPANIES, STRIVING TO GROW INVESTMENT PRINCIPAL WITHOUT
EXCESS EXPOSURE TO RISK."

TCW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS/Craig C. Blum, CFA, Managing Director, and Stephen A.
Burlingame, Managing Director INVESTMENT STYLE/Growth - TCW invests in companies
that have superior sales growth, leading and/or rising market shares, and high
and/or rising profit margins. TCW's concentrated growth equity strategy seeks
leading companies with distinct advantages in their business model and an
inherent edge over their competitors. Research plays a critical role in the
selection process, and the investment horizon is long-term.

"WE CONSTRUCT CONCENTRATED, CONVICTION-WEIGHTED PORTFOLIOS OF COMPANIES THAT
POSSESS SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, ALLOWING THEM TO CAPITALIZE ON
LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES."

CRAIG BLUM,
TCW (GROWTH)"

LAMCO: In last year's roundtable, we asked the managers to briefly summarize
their investment philosophy and strategy. We thought it was an excellent
opportunity to allow Fund shareholders to compare the varying investment
approaches that are combined to form the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund. So, we'd
like to start this year in the same manner and ask the growth managers to get us
underway. Craig Blum, sum up TCW's approach and then let's hear from Frank
Mastrapasqua.

BLUM (TCW--GROWTH): We believe superior returns can be achieved by maintaining a
long-term perspective and emphasizing the highest quality companies that have
open-ended growth opportunities. We construct concentrated, conviction-weighted
portfolios of companies that possess sustainable competitive advantages,
allowing them to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.

MASTRAPASQUA (MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT - GROWTH): Our investment philosophy
is to build client wealth through disciplined portfolio management. We are a
sector-focused, large-to-mid capitalization growth manager. We analyze
investments using our proprietary screens, in-house research and direct contact
with companies, striving to grow investment principal without excess exposure to
risk. Independent research gives us a competitive advantage. Our analysts
evaluate company growth potential, which includes market share prospects,
financial condition, key components of earnings and cash flow growth, execution
of management's vision, and competitive advantage. We utilize a proprietary
valuation process called the GRAD Point methodology (Growth to Risk-Adjusted
Differential), which risk-adjusts the price-to-earnings ratio and compares it to
the 3- to 5-year earnings per share projected growth rate.

LAMCO: Let's hear from the value side managers on their approach and philosophy.
David Katz, you're the newest manager, so let's turn to you first.

KATZ (MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS - VALUE): We are an opportunistic value investor
trying to invest in good businesses at a significant discount from what we think
an astute business person would pay to own and operate the company. Our
investment philosophy is tied to the traditional tenets of Graham and Dodd, but
we have adopted their philosophy to the economy of the twenty-first century. We
perform detailed, fundamental analysis on companies. We try to figure out what a
sensible valuation is based on the company's earnings, dividends, return on
equity, asset value and so forth. But within the value school, we have a strong
bias towards better businesses and better industries. Some traditional value
managers only focus on "old economy" companies. We, on the other hand, are as
comfortable buying a technology company as we are a ketchup company.

"...WITHIN THE VALUE SCHOOL, WE HAVE A STRONG BIAS TOWARDS BETTER BUSINESSES AND
BETTER INDUSTRIES...WE ARE AS COMFORTABLE BUYING A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS WE ARE
A KETCHUP COMPANY."

DAVID KATZ,
MATRIX ASSET ADVISERS (VALUE)

LAMCO: Arnie Schneider and Rama Krishna, round out your value point of view,
please.

SCHNEIDER (SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - VALUE): We believe that disciplined
value investing, built on a research-driven foundation, can deliver investment
success over time. Promising opportunities can be

                                       13
<Page>

found among securities that are most deeply undervalued relative to their future
earnings potential. Our research process is geared toward identifying securities
with low investor expectations that are temporarily trading at a substantial
discount to their underlying business value.

KRISHNA (PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT - VALUE): We are old-fashioned value
investors. Some people would use the term "deep value." We think of it in a
fairly straightforward way: We're trying to find good companies when their share
prices get very depressed relative to the ability of the underlying business to
generate earnings and cash flow over the long term. We approach these businesses
with a fairly healthy dose of realism; that is, you don't get to buy the best
businesses with the fastest growth rates and the wonderful management teams and
all of the characteristics that everybody wants for the simple reason that they
don't sell for a low price. Many times, however, there are good businesses that
do get marked down, generally because something has gone wrong. Our whole
philosophy is to try and identify those companies and then make the judgment as
to which ones are really good businesses where the problems are only temporary.

LAMCO: With 2004 now complete, it was one of those years in which consensus
estimates among investment managers appear to have played out in reality--that
is, for reasonable gains around 10 percent for indices such as the S&P 500 and
the Russell 1000, with smaller cap stocks providing returns in the 15 to 20
percent range. Looking back at 2004, how do you assess the year from the
perspective of your own style and strategy? Let's go in reverse order and start
with the value managers and Rama Krishna.

"WE'RE TRYING TO FIND GOOD COMPANIES WHEN THEIR SHARE PRICES GET VERY DEPRESSED
RELATIVE TO THE ABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND CASH
FLOW OVER THE LONG TERM."

RAMA KRISHNA,
PZEMA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
(VALUE)

KRISHNA (PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT - VALUE): As we began 2004, valuation
spreads between the cheapest stocks in our universe and the broad market were
narrow. We weren't seeing the same types of deeply discounted opportunities that
had existed when there was significant uncertainty about the future of the
economy, and about geopolitical risks. The types of opportunities that we were
seeing tended to be in what one might consider to be "boring" companies, i.e.,
insurance and other non-bank financials. Our expectation was for single digit
market returns, with a fairly normal margin of value outperformance. So, from
that perspective, we were pretty satisfied with the way 2004 turned out.

SCHNEIDER (SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - VALUE): The market environment favored
our value style investment philosophy. Value indexes outperformed growth for
five years in a row, based on the Russell 1000 indices. Our portfolio was also
well positioned throughout the year in cyclical companies that delivered notable
earnings gains in 2004 and offered the potential for continued progress.

KATZ (MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS - VALUE): Two thousand four was a difficult year for
us on a relative and absolute basis. There was a high negative correlation
between market leadership and our portfolio. We were not meaningfully
represented in energy, utilities, basic materials and real estate-related
stocks. While value outpaced growth last year, we perceived the greater large
cap value opportunity to be in out-of-favor or fallen growth stock holdings,
which were exhibiting value-like pricing with growth-like business performance.
Our focus on these large and often mega-cap stellar businesses, however, lagged
the market in 2004, as these stocks continued to trail smaller and more
speculative stocks. Also, many of the industries we did like, such as
semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, encountered a difficult year.

LAMCO: Let's turn to the growth managers and ask them about their style and how
it fared last year. Frank Mastrapasqua, what are your thoughts?

MASTRAPASQUA (MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT - GROWTH): Large cap growth
underperformed many of the other equity asset classes and fell victim to the
compression of international political stresses--principally, terrorist
risks--that impacted investor psychology from June through September.

                                       14
<Page>

Moreover, the election further heightened investor anxiety depressing
valuations. The fourth quarter reflected the lessening of such stress and an
increasing focus upon the fundamentals.

BURLINGAME (TCW - GROWTH): While large capitalization growth stocks were out of
favor we were able to outperform the broad market with superior stock selection.

LAMCO: Two thousand five may be shaping up as 2004's opposite, in that there is
less consensus among investors. The bulls and bears can both make compelling
cases. Most of the Fund's managers take a bottom-up approach, while keeping an
eye on macro factors. In light of your approach, what are your thoughts about
'05?

"OUR RESEARCH PROCESS IS GEARED TOWARD IDENTIFYING SECURITIES WITH LOW INVESTOR
EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE TEMPORARILY TRADING AT A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT TO THEIR
UNDERLYING BUSINESS VALUE."

ARNIE SCHNEIDER,
SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (VALUE)

MASTRAPASQUA (MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT - GROWTH): We expect that 2005
should experience somewhat less external stress with emphasis upon rational
business decision-making. Cash flow, profit growth and a resulting positive
impact on capital spending should be the main contributors to economic growth.
The under-investing relative to cash flow that dominated last year should be
reversed in 2005. The delays in the replacement cycle and the technological
advancements that have emerged in the last four to five years should foster an
acceleration in spending.

BLUM (TCW - GROWTH): While there is consensus among economists that in 2005 the
economy will continue to grow slowly with modest inflation, equity outlooks are
all over the map. We will keep a close eye on energy costs, the dollar, Fed
policy, housing and capital spending like everyone else. But, in the final
analysis we will construct the portfolio on a bottom-up basis emphasizing high
quality growth companies.

LAMCO: Let's ask the value managers to share their thoughts about the year
ahead. Start us off, please, Arnie Schneider.

SCHNEIDER (SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - VALUE): U.S. equity valuations are not
cheap relative to our current point in the economic, corporate profit and
interest rate cycles. The economic scene should be relatively tranquil in 2005,
but there is no doubt that global economies are slowing. The rate of U.S.
corporate profit growth peaked in 1Q04, and profit margins stand at historical
highs. In addition, we have begun the next cycle of global monetary tightening.
U.S. equity returns averaging in the mid-single digits would not surprise us.

KATZ (MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS - VALUE): We believe that, like 2004, the impact of
stock picking will be significant in 2005. However, unlike 2004, we expect to
see different leaders, both in terms of sectors and individual issues.
Basically, we think that 2005 will be the year that mega-cap stocks once again
reemerge as market leaders after a long exile. We also look for strength in the
semi-conductor area of tech, and for capital markets-oriented financials to move
ahead despite relative weakness in consumer-oriented financials.

KRISHNA (PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT - VALUE): Valuation spreads are even
narrower at the beginning of 2005, given that value stocks outperformed the
broad market in 2004. The outlook for stocks in general is still OK. Inflation
is in check and corporate earnings growth, though slower than last year, should
still be respectable. Despite the narrow valuation spreads, there are still
opportunities for the value investor to add value, as we apply our research to
identify valuation anomalies at the company level. Some new opportunities have
recently emerged, particularly in businesses that have been hurt by the recent
spike in raw material prices.

"WHILE LARGE CAPITALIZATION GROWTH STOCKS WERE OUT OF FAVOR [IN 2004] WE WERE
ABLE TO OUTPERFORM THE BROAD MARKET WITH SUPERIOR STOCK SELECTION."

STEPHEN BURLINGAME, TCW (GROWTH)

LAMCO: What are the one or two macro factors (e.g., interest rates, energy
costs, raw materials/commodities, geopolitical tensions, corporate earnings,
etc.) that you believe investors should watch in '05 as positive or negative

                                       15
<Page>

influences insofar as stock market performance is concerned? Let's stay with the
value managers.

SCHNEIDER (SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - VALUE): Long-term interest rates bear
close watching in 2005. Surprisingly, long-term Treasury yields hardly budged in
2004. Given the likelihood for higher rates, it will be important for investors
to discern the reasons for the increases in order to judge their influence on
the equity market. For example, rising rates could be the normal outcome of
another year of moderate economic growth. They could, however, be a reaction to
inflation fears, a fall in the dollar, or less willingness on the part of
foreigners to buy Treasuries to finance our current account deficit.

"WE BELIEVE THAT, LIKE 2004, THE IMPACT OF STOCK PICKING WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IN
2005. HOWEVER, UNLIKE 2004, WE EXPECT TO SEE DIFFERENT LEADERS..."

DAVID KATZ,
MATRIX ASSET ADVISERS (VALUE)

KATZ (MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS - VALUE): We believe that among the various macro
factors interest rates are likely to play the largest role in 2005. Rising
interest rates should reflect continued economic strength, which will serve as
an important backdrop to the 2005 stock market. Rising rates should dampen the
enthusiasm for real estate and there could be a pendulum swing back to equities
from real estate as well as from bonds, assuming long-term rates finally begin
to rise materially. Geopolitical uncertainty has become a fact of life, and
always has the potential to wreak short-term havoc on the equity market.

KRISHNA (PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT - VALUE): Heightened inflationary fears
would not be constructive for equities, given the low inflation assumptions that
are discounted in the market today. Any number of factors could contribute to an
acceleration of inflation: collapse of the dollar or a spike in energy prices
are just two potential sources. We're not making bets on either, just keeping
our eyes open. We might see an acceleration of merger activity, as corporate
balance sheets are in great shape, and companies are searching for topline
growth in a moderate GDP growth environment.

LAMCO: Let's hear from the growth managers, starting with Frank Mastrapasqua.

MASTRAPASQUA (MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT - GROWTH): The pace of interest rate
changes and the behavior of oil prices are likely to periodically impact the
equity market and contribute to volatility. At the same time, productivity, cash
flow and the competitive advantage the dollar is providing should foster
positive results. In today's environment, growth offers the best value. The
underperformance of growth stocks for the last five years and the earning power
that has been generated makes for an intriguing valuation environment in
2005-2006. For example, the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio for our stocks
is approximately half the S&P 500 (1.5 vs. 3.1).

BURLINGAME (TCW - GROWTH): A weakening dollar could put upward pressure on
interest rates and inflation. This could spell problems for housing, which in
turn would slow consumer spending and negatively impact all financial assets. In
the early stages of a recovery, economically-sensitive commodity businesses that
trade at low valuations get a strong bounce. We have seen that so far. However,
as the recovery matures, only those solid growth companies that are gaining a
larger share of the overall economy are going to be able to demonstrate good
growth. Even if multiples do not expand, growing companies should see price
appreciation. At this stage we feel the normal valuation premium afforded to
quality growth companies has been compressed such that, ironically, growth
represents good value.

"THE OUTLOOK FOR STOCKS IN GENERAL IS STILL OK. INFLATION IS IN CHECK AND
CORPORATE EARNINGS GROWTH, THOUGH SLOWER THAN LAST YEAR, SHOULD STILL BE
RESPECTABLE."

RAMA KRISHNA,
PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
(VALUE)

LAMCO: Let's conclude as we did last year, and that is by asking you to identify
a stock that you have added recently to the portion of the All-Star Equity Fund
portfolio that you manage and tell us why you invested in it.

                                       16

Why don't you lead off for the value managers, David Katz?

KATZ (MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS - VALUE):

MedImmune is a biotechnology company with $1 billion in revenues, a very strong
balance sheet with more than $4 cash per share and great prospects. MedImmune
combines a leading business position with a compelling valuation of 18 times
earnings when certain money-losing R&D projects and cash per share are excluded.
Our belief is that MedImmune's strong operating posture is enhanced by a good
pipeline, including expected royalties from upcoming cervical cancer vaccines.
We believe that in a pharmaceutical industry seeking additional product
opportunities, MedImmune is an extremely attractive acquisition candidate. At a
$6.2 billion market capitalization, the company is readily digestible. Our sense
is that management has a greater willingness to entertain a merger at the right
price, something they were not previously in favor of. We think the stock can be
a strong performer on its own and a home run if acquired.

KRISHNA (PZENA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT - VALUE): We recently added McKesson Corp.,
a pharmaceutical distributor, to the portfolio. We like the industry structure,
as McKesson and its two primary competitors, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal
Health, each have an approximately 30 percent market share. However, the
industry profitability model is in transition, as McKesson and others
historically made money from obtaining special pricing from manufacturers, as
well as by making large inventory purchases in advance of drug price increases.
Drug companies have cut back on these special deals, as well as on the amount of
inventory they will allow a distributor to hold, cutting into the margins of all
drug distributors. In the future, McKesson and its competitors expect to recover
margin by pricing contracts with reduced discounts to its customers, as well as
through better overall pricing from the manufacturers. Priced at about 10 times
our normal earnings estimate, McKesson stock is an attractive opportunity.

SCHNEIDER (SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - VALUE): Carnival Corp. is the world's
largest cruise line in a growth industry dominated by two major players. After
enduring three years of large increases in industry capacity and a brutal
pricing environment, the cruise industry's future has begun a promising
turnaround. Slowing capacity growth and resurgent demand have led to a more
favorable pricing environment. Carnival will be able to use its scale and cost
advantages to generate meaningful growth in earnings and cash flow.

LAMCO: Let's turn to the growth managers to hear about their recent purchases.

BLUM (TCW - GROWTH): We added XM Satellite Radio to the portfolio. XM is the
market share leader in the rapidly growing "for fee" radio market. The business
enjoys tremendous leverage as the costs of satellite and programming are largely
fixed and can be spread over an ever-growing subscriber base. Competition is
limited, as the company operates in a regulated duopoly and offers a compelling
product at a modest price.

MASTRAPASQUA (MASTRAPASQUA ASSET MANAGEMENT - GROWTH): Monster Worldwide is
engaged in online career management through the industry-leading Web site
Monster.com. The company also has an online advertising agency and yellow pages
advertising agency through its directional marketing business. On a broad level,
the company will benefit from an improving economy and accelerating hiring
activity. Monster has established itself as the leader in online career
management while creating a disciplined cost management strategy. The
combination provides for significant operating leverage as the improving economy
leads to job creation. The 95 percent operating margins for the Monster division
highlight the opportunity to transfer significant revenue growth to the bottom
line.

"GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD FOR HIGHER RATES, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR INVESTORS TO
DISCERN THE REASONS FOR THE INCREASES IN ORDER TO JUDGE THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE
EQUITY MARKET."

ARNIE SCHNEIDER,
SCHNEIDER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (VALUE)

LAMCO: Many thanks to all.

The dark blue region of the graph above reflects the growth of the investment
assuming all distributions were received in cash and not reinvested back in the
Fund. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $47,317 (this
value includes distributions per share totaling $18.83 during the period,
including tax credits of $0.67 per share on retained capital gains).

    The light blue region of the graph depicts additional value realized through
reinvestment of all distributions and participation in all the rights offerings
under the terms of each offering. On six occasions, the Fund has conducted
rights offerings that allow shareholders to purchase additional shares at a
discount. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $102,401.

*    The Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains exceeded
     the amount to be distributed under the Fund's 10 percent distribution
     policy. In each case, the Fund elected to pay taxes on the undistributed
     income and passed through a proportionate tax credit to shareholders.
**   The number of shares offered was increased by an additional 25% to cover a
     portion of the over-subscription requests.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's current policy, in effect since 1988, is to pay
distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net asset
value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent of the
Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday
prior to each quarterly declaration date. THE FIXED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FUND'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME OR NET REALIZED
CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND MAY BE TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME UP TO THE AMOUNT OF
THE FUND'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. If, for any calendar
year, the total distributions made under the 10 percent pay-out policy exceed
the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will
generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the
shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment
income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed
under the 10 percent pay-out policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and
not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the
extent of such excess. The Fund retained such excess gains in 1993, 1996 and
1997.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2004

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (the "Fund"), is a Massachusetts business trust
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Fund seeks total investment return comprised of long-term capital
appreciation and current income through investing primarily in a diversified
portfolio of equity securities.

FUND SHARES

The Fund may issue an unlimited number of shares of shares of beneficial
interest.

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price at the close of the
principal exchange on which they trade. Unlisted securities or listed securities
for which there were no sales during the day are valued at the closing bid price
on such exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

     Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the
Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board"), based upon market transactions for
normal, institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The services may
use various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such
as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations
are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid
quotation.

     Short-term debt obligations maturing in more than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at current market value. Short-term
debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

     Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied
procedures approved by and under the general supervision of the Board.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with institutions that
the Fund's investment advisor has determined are creditworthy. The Fund, through
its custodian, receives delivery of underlying securities collateralizing a
repurchase agreement. Collateral is at least equal, at all times, to the value
of the repurchase obligation including interest. A repurchase agreement
transaction involves certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the
counterparty. These risks include possible delays or restrictions upon the
Fund's ability to dispose of the underlying securities and a possible decline in
the value of the underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
assert its rights.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions
and dividend income are recorded on the ex-date.

     The Fund estimates components of distributions from real estate investment
trusts (REIT's). Distributions received in excess of income are recorded as a
reduction of the cost of the related investments. If the Fund no longer owns the
applicable securities, any distributions received in excess of income are
recorded as realized gains.

     Effective July 1, 2004, the Fund adopted the policy to reduce cost of
investments for financial statement purposes by the distributions received in
excess of income from REIT's. The effect of the change for the year ended
December 31, 2004 is as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
     DECREASE          DECREASE IN        INCREASE IN NET
      IN COST        DIVIDEND INCOME      REALIZED GAINS

     $  8,281           $  69,760            $  61,479
</Table>

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

Consistent with the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable income to shareholders, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund currently has a policy of paying distributions on its shares of
beneficial interest totaling approximately 10%

                                       36
<Page>

of its net asset value per year. The distributions are payable in four quarterly
distributions of 2.5% of the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York
Stock Exchange on the Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on ex-date.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Fund's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

     For the year ended December 31, 2004, permanent book and tax basis
differences resulting primarily from differing treatments for REIT adjustments
and foreign currency transactions were identified and reclassified among the
components of the Fund's net assets as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
UNDISTRIBUTED NET      ACCUMULATED
INVESTMENT INCOME   NET REALIZED LOSS   PAID-IN CAPITAL
- -----------------   -----------------   ---------------
<s>                 <C>                 <C>
$      (2,392,232)  $       2,392,232   $            --
</Table>

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003 was as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
                                12/31/04           12/31/03

                                  91,954,330        38,090,476
Return of capital                 23,903,756        53,106,588
                            ----------------   ---------------
                            $    115,858,086   $    91,197,064
</Table>

*For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are considered
ordinary income distributions.

As of December 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
UNDISTRIBUTED   UNDISTRIBUTED
  ORDINARY        LONG-TERM     NET UNREALIZED
  INCOME*       CAPITAL GAINS    APPRECIATION*

<s>             <C>             <C>
$          --   $          --   $  174,701,257
</Table>

*The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized appreciation
are primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales.

     Capital loss carryforwards may be available to reduce taxable income
arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the extent
permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2004, the Fund had no
capital loss carryforwards.

     Future realized gains offset by the loss carry-forwards are not required to
be distributed to shareholders. However, under the Fund's distribution policy,
as described above, such gains may be distributed to shareholders in the year
gains are realized. Any gains distributed may be taxable to shareholders as
ordinary income.

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

Liberty Asset Management Company ("LAMCO"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor of the Fund.
Prior to April 1, 2004, LAMCO was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April 1, 2004,
FleetBoston, including the Fund's investment advisor, was acquired by BOA. The
acquisition did not change the way the Fund is managed, the investment personnel
assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

LAMCO receives a monthly investment advisory fee based on the Fund's average
weekly net assets at the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
       AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         ANNUAL FEE RATE
       -------------------------         ---------------
         <S>                                  <C>

         Next $400 million                    0.720%
         Next $400 million                    0.648%
         Over $1.2 billion                    0.584%
</Table>

     For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund's effective investment
advisory fee rate was 0.72%.

     Under Portfolio Manager Agreements, LAMCO pays each Portfolio Manager a
portfolio management fee based on the assets of the investment portfolio that
they manage. The portfolio management fee is paid from the investment advisory
fees collected by LAMCO and is based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at
the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
       AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         ANNUAL FEE RATE
       -------------------------         ---------------
         <S>                                  <C>

fee based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
       AVERAGE WEEKLY NET ASSETS         ANNUAL FEE RATE
       -------------------------         ---------------

         Over $1.2 billion                    0.146%
</Table>

     For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund's effective administration
fee rate was 0.18%.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BOA and an affiliate of LAMCO, is responsible for providing
pricing and bookkeeping services to the Fund under a pricing and bookkeeping
agreement. Under a separate agreement (the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia
has delegated those functions to State Street Corporation ("State Street"). As a
result, Columbia pays the total fees collected from the Fund for these services
to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

     Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Fund, Columbia
receives from the Fund an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any
month that the Fund's average weekly net assets exceed $50 million, an
additional monthly fee. The additional fee rate is calculated by taking into
account the fees payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. This
rate is applied to the average daily net assets of the Fund for that month. The
Fund also pays additional fees for pricing services based on the number of
securities held by the Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the effective
pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.017%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Fund could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement
in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS

With the exception of one officer, all officers of the Fund are employees of
LAMCO or its affiliates and receive no compensation from the Fund. Effective
August 23, 2004, the Board of Trustees appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to
the Fund in accordance with federal securities regulations. The Fund, along with
other affiliated funds, will pay its pro-rata share of the expenses associated
with the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer. The Fund's fee will not exceed
$15,000 per year.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Fund related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund paid $2,937 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Miscellaneous expenses"
on the Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $737,336,418 and
$675,567,026, respectively.

NOTE 6. OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund used Bank of America
Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of BOA, as a broker. Total commissions
paid to Bank of America Securities during the period were $11,469.

NOTE 7. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended December 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003,
distributions in the amount of $49,083,142 and $38,881,100, respectively, were
paid in newly issued shares valued at market value or net asset value, but not
less than 95% of market value. Such distributions resulted in the issuance of
5,510,950 and 4,584,918 shares, respectively.

NOTE 8. RIGHTS OFFERING

In a rights offering commencing June 3, 2004, shareholders were issued
non-transferable rights entitling them to subscribe for one additional share for
every ten shares held, with the right to subscribe for additional shares not
subscribed for by others in the primary subscription. The rights offering
expired on July 7, 2004. Shareholders exercised rights to purchase 15,841,927
shares at $8.34 per share, which represented 95% of the net asset value on July
8, 2004. Total proceeds of the offering, net of expenses, amounted to
$131,705,875. The issuance of shares at a discount to NAV resulted in dilution
to the NAV of $0.05 per share.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LIBERTY ALL-STAR EQUITY FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2004, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and its financial highlights for the periods indicated in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. The financial highlights of the Fund for periods prior to January
1, 1999 were audited by another independent registered public accounting firm
whose report dated February 12, 1999 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements.

AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)

Under the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"), shareholders may elect to participate and have all their Fund dividends
and distributions automatically reinvested by EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as
agent for participants in the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), in additional shares of
the Fund. For further information and enrollment forms, call Investor Assistance
at 1-800-LIB-FUND (1-800-542-3863) weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern
Time.

     Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
other nominee can participate in the Plan only if their brokerage firm, bank or
nominee is able to do so on their behalf. Shareholders participating in the Plan
through a brokerage firm may not be able to transfer their shares to another
brokerage firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

     Under the Plan, distributions declared payable in shares or cash at the
option of shareholders are paid to participants in the Plan entirely in newly
issued full and fractional shares valued at the lower of market value or net
asset value per share on the valuation date for the distribution (but not at a
discount of more than 5 percent from market price). Distributions declared
payable only in cash will be reinvested for the accounts of participants in the
Plan in additional shares purchased by the Plan Agent on the open market at
prevailing market prices. If, prior to the Plan Agent's completion of such open
market purchases, the market price of a share equals or exceeds its net asset
value, the remainder of the distribution will be paid in newly issued shares
valued at net asset value (but not at a discount of more than 5% from market
price). Dividends and distributions are subject to taxation, whether received in
cash or in shares.

     Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
in any amount on a monthly basis for investment in shares of the Fund purchased
on the open market. These voluntary cash payments will be invested on or shortly
after the 15th day of each calendar month, and voluntary payments should be sent
so as to be received by the Plan Agent no later than five business days before
the next investment date. Barring suspension of trading, voluntary cash payments
will be invested within 45 days of receipt. A participant may withdraw a
voluntary cash payment by written notice received by the Plan Agent at least 48
hours before such payment is to be invested.

     The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

     There is no charge to participants for reinvesting distributions pursuant
to the Plan. The Plan Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. There are no brokerage
charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of
dividends or distributions declared payable in shares or in cash. However, each
participant bears a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of distributions declared payable in cash.

     With respect to purchases from voluntary cash payments, the Plan Agent will
charge $1.25 for each such purchase for a participant, plus a pro rata share of
the brokerage commissions. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts of
shares for individual accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than the
usual brokerage charges for such transactions, as the Plan Agent will be
purchasing shares for all participants in blocks and prorating the lower
commission thus attainable.

     Shareholders may terminate their participation in the Plan by written
notice to the Plan Agent, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010. Such termination will be effective immediately if
received not less than 10 days prior to the record date for a dividend or
distribution; otherwise it will be effective on the first business day after the
payment date of such dividend or distribution. On termination, participants may
either have certificates for the Fund shares in their Plan accounts delivered to
them or have the Plan Agent sell such shares in the open market and deliver the
proceeds, less a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commissions, to the participant.

     Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

   (a) The registrant has, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
       adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
       executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
       officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
       regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or
       a third party.

   (b) During the period covered by this report, there were not any amendments
       to a provision of the code of ethics adopted in 2(a) above.

   (c) During the period covered by this report, there were not any waivers or
       implicit waivers to a provision of the code of ethics adopted in 2(a)
       above.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Audit Committee is composed of four of the registrant's
independent directors who are not affiliated with the registrant's investment
adviser. The Board has determined that each of the audit committee members is
"financially literate" and that at least one member has "accounting or related
financial management expertise" as used in the New York Stock Exchange
definitions of the terms.

       Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if the Board of Directors has not
determined that a "financial expert," a new term based on criteria contained in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is serving on the audit committee, it must disclose this
fact and explain why the committee does not have such an expert. The Board of
Directors has determined that none of the members of its audit committee meets
the technical requirements of the definition. Moreover, it believes that for the
following reasons it is not necessary for a registered investment company such
as the registrant, with an audit committee that meets the New York Stock
Exchange requirements of financial literacy, to have a "financial expert" as a
member of the committee.

1.   The financial statements of and accounting principles applying to
     registered investment companies such as the registrant are relatively
     straightforward and transparent compared to those of operating companies.
     The significant accounting

<Page>

     issues are valuation of securities and other assets (regulated under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") and computed daily),
     accrual of expenses, allocation of joint expenses shared with other
     entities, such as insurance premiums, and disclosures of all related party
     transactions. Equally important is a knowledge of the tax laws applying to
     registered investment companies. None of the accounting issues involving
     corporate America that have received recent publicity, such as
     sophisticated derivative transactions and special purpose entities, are
     present in financial reporting for registered investment companies.

2.   During the years that the registrant has been filing financial reports
     under the 1940 Act since its inception in 1986 there has never been a
     requirement for a financial report or statement to be restated.

3.   The current members of the audit committee have many years of aggregate
     experience serving on this audit committee and in the Board's judgment,
     through this experience and experience with other public corporation's
     financial affairs, they have an understanding of the relevant generally
     accepted accounting principles governing the registrant's financial
     statements, tax laws applying to the registrant, the registrant's internal
     accounting controls and audit committee functions necessary to satisfy the
     objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the financial
     statements, auditing process and internal controls of the registrant.

4.   The audit committee has the capability of employing a consultant who
     satisfies the technical definition of a "financial expert" and will do so
     from time to time if circumstances warrant.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

(a) Aggregate Audit Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

                                            2004               2003
                                            $38,700            $33,000

Audit Fees include amounts related to the audit of the registrant's annual
financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal
years. In fiscal year 2004, Audit Fees include a proxy review and issuance of a
consent letter in connection with a rights offering.

(b) Aggregate Audit-Related Fees billed by the principal accountant for
professional services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

<Page>

                                            2004               2003
                                            $4,000             $4,000

Audit-Related Fees include amounts for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported in Audit Fees
above. In both fiscal years 2004 and 2003, Audit-Related Fees include certain
agreed-upon procedures performed for semi-annual shareholder reports.

(c) Aggregate Tax Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are approximately as follows:

                                            2004               2003
                                            $2,600             $2,600

Tax Fees in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 consist primarily of the review of
annual tax returns and include amounts for professional services by the
principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.

(d) Aggregate All Other Fees billed by the principal accountant for professional
services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003 are as follows:

                                            2004               2003
                                            $0                 $0

All Other Fees include amounts for products and services provided by the
principal accountant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a) through
(c) above.

None of the amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (d) above were approved
pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X.

(e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the "Policy")
which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which the Audit
Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit (including audit related,
tax and all other) services provided by the registrant's independent auditor to
the registrant and individual funds (collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all
non-audit services provided by the registrant's independent auditor to the
funds' adviser or a control affiliate of the adviser, that relate directly to
the funds' operations and financial reporting (collectively "Fund-related
Adviser Services"). A "control affiliate" is an entity controlling, controlled
by, or under

<Page>

common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the funds, and
the term "adviser" is deemed to exclude any unaffiliated sub-adviser whose role
is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another
investment adviser. The adviser and control affiliates are collectively referred
to as "Adviser Entities."

The Audit Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case basis as
potential services are contemplated) and general (pre-determined list of
permitted services) pre-approvals. Unless a type of service has received general
pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it
is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The Policy does not delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration
shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general pre-approval.

These schedules will provide a description of each type of service that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fees
for each instance of providing each service. This general pre-approval and
related fees (where provided) will generally cover a one-year period (for
example, from June 1 through May 31 of the following year). The Audit Committee
will review and approve the types of services and review the projected fees for
the next one-year period and may add to, or subtract from, the list of general
pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.
This approval acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the
specific types of services that the independent auditor will be permitted to
perform. The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary at other
regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has the
authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate amount of non-audit services
provided to an individual fund.

If, subsequent to general pre-approval, a fund, its investment adviser or a
control affiliate determines that it would like to engage the independent
auditor to perform a service that requires pre-approval and that is not included
in the general pre-approval list, the specific pre-approval procedure shall be
as follows:

     -    A brief written request shall be prepared by management detailing the
          proposed engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed to
          be performed by the independent auditor;
     -    The request should be addressed to the Audit Committee with copies to
          the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;

<Page>

     -    The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will
          arrange for a discussion of the service to be included on the agenda
          for the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, when the
          Committee will discuss the proposed engagement and approve or deny the
          request.
     -    If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
          commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairperson
          of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of
          the Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine to
          call a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of
          considering the proposal. Should the Chairperson of the Audit
          Committee be unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee may
          serve as an alternate for the purpose of approving or denying the
          request. Discussion with the Chairperson (or alternate, if necessary)
          will be arranged by the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee
          Administration. The independent auditor will not commence any such
          project unless and until specific approval has been given.

III. CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed to
be provided by the independent auditor to the adviser or control affiliates are
not Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of the Policy, but
nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing evaluation of the
auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its audit services to the
funds. As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
auditor to provide audit or non-audit services that are not Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit
Committee, and the projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of
all such engagements during the period covered by the Policy) exceeds a
pre-determined threshold established by the Audit Committee; the independent
auditor, Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will notify
the Audit Committee not later than its next meeting. Such notification shall
include a general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be
the recipient of such services, the timing of the engagement, the entity's
reasons for selecting the independent auditor, and the projected fees. Such
information will allow the Audit Committee to consider whether non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject to
Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the auditor's
independence with respect to the Funds.

IV.  REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Fund Treasurer or Director of Trustee Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered,
including:

     -    A general description of the services, and
     -    Actual billed and projected fees, and

<Page>

     -    The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser Services
          were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

In addition, the independent auditor shall report to the Audit Committee
annually, and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the
SEC, all non-audit services provided to entities in the funds' "investment
company complex," as defined by SEC rules, that did not require pre-approval
under the Policy.

V. AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Policy may be amended from time to time by the Audit Committee. Prompt
notice of any amendments will be provided to the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee Administration. The Policy shall be reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

                                      *****

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during both fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was zero.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 are disclosed in (b) through (d) of this Item.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, there
were no Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees or All Other Fees that were approved for
services to the investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant under
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

The percentage of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees required to be
approved under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X that were
approved under the "de minimis" exception during both fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was zero.

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that

<Page>

provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant
to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, is compatible with
maintaining the principal accountant's independence. The Audit Committee
determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). John A. Benning, James E. Grinnell, Richard W. Lowry and John J.
Neuhauser are each independent trustees and collectively constitute the entire
Audit Committee.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The registrant's "Schedule I - Investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers" (as set forth in 17 CFR 210.12-12) is included in Item 1 of this Form
N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Liberty Asset Management Company (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of
the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each proposal and votes the
proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the proposal would be
expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund. The Advisor
determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential economic
return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any benefit to
the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. The Advisor's
Proxy Committee includes a representative from Liberty Asset Management Company
and representatives from the Advisor's equity investments and equity research
functions. In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Proxy
Committee has the responsibility to review, on an annual basis, the Advisor's
proxy voting policies to ensure consistency with internal policies and
regulatory agency policies and to develop additional voting guidelines to assist
in the review of proxy proposals.

<Page>

The Proxy Committee may vary from the predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of the
issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best interest of the client.
References to the best interest of a client refer to the interest of the client
in terms of the potential economic return on the client's investment. In
determining the vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any
benefit other than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted. A member
of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for which he or
she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship with the
issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to disclose
to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or other matter
known to the person that would create a potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third
party vendor, to implement its proxy voting process. ISS provides proxy
analysis, record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

                                                             Exhibit 99.Code Eth

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

     I.     COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

                 This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies
            within the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the
            "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal
            Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting
            Officer, and Director of Trustee Administration (the "Covered
            Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

                 -  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling
                    of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal
                    and professional relationships;
                 -  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure
                    in reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits
                    to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in
                    other public communications made by a Fund;
                 -  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                    regulations;
                 -  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to
                    an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
                 -  accountability for adherence to the Code.

                 Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of
            business ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give
            rise to actual or apparent conflicts of interest.

     II.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

                 .  The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
            (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be
            primarily responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code
            Officer"). The Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management
            Group Compliance Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his
            or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
            temporary basis.

                 Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief
            Legal Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
            the rules promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund
            shall assist the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code.
            The Chief Legal Officer shall be responsible for applying this Code
            to specific situations in which questions are presented under it (in
            consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and has the
            authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.
            However, any

<Page>

            waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
            Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

     III.   MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                 OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
            Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or
            his/her service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest
            would arise if a Covered Officer, or a family member, receives
            improper personal benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's
            position with a Fund.

                 Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships
            between Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to
            conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of
            1940 (the "Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
            (the "Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not
            individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or
            sale of securities or other property) with a Fund because of their
            status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and its
            investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed
            to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of those provisions.
            This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those
            programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the
            parameters of this Code.

                 Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
            personal benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
            contractual relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser,
            administrator, principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent
            and/or transfer agent (each, a "Service Provider") of which the
            Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
            Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course
            of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for a Service
            Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
            implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
            Service Provider and a Fund. The participation of the Covered
            Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
            relationship between the Fund and the Service Provider and is
            consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
            duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is recognized by the
            Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of
            one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
            codes.

                 Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if
            such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the
            Company Act and the Advisers Act. The following list provides
            examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered
            Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive.
            The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered
            Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of a
            Fund.

<Page>

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  not use personal influence or personal relationships
                    improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                    reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member would benefit personally to the
                    detriment of a Fund; and

                 -  not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
                    the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member rather than the benefit of the
                    Fund.(1).

                 There are some conflict of interest situations that must be
            approved by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief
            Legal Officer. Those situations include, but are not limited to,:

                 -  service as director on the board of any public or private
                    company;
                 -  the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the aggregate
                    from a third party that does or seeks to do business with
                    the Funds during any 12-month period;
                 -  the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                    a Fund has current or prospective business dealings, unless
                    such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                    appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                    raise any question of impropriety;
                 -  any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or
                    employment relationship with, any Fund service providers,
                    other than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                    administrator or any affiliated person thereof;
                 -  a direct or indirect material financial interest in
                    commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund
                    for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or
                    redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the
                    Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity
                    ownership.

     IV.    DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

                 Each Covered Officer shall:

                 -  be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally
                    applicable to the Funds;

- ----------
(1) For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered Officers
shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<Page>

                 -  not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
                    facts about any Fund to others, whether within or outside
                    the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors, and
                    to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
                    organizations;
                 -  to the extent appropriate within his/her area of
                    responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
                    the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting full,
                    fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
                    reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the
                    SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds;
                    and
                 -  promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
                    imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

     V.     REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered
                    Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has
                    received, read and understands the Code;
                 -  annually affirm to the Board compliance with the
                    requirements of the Code;
                 -  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                    employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                    reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                 -  notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer promptly
                    if he/she knows of any violation of this Code; and
                 -  respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires circulated
                    periodically in connection with the preparation of
                    disclosure documents for the Funds.

                 The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities
            related to this Code.

                 The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in
            investigating and enforcing this Code:

                 -  The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will take
                    all appropriate action to investigate any potential
                    violation reported to him/her;
                 -  If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and
                    the Code Officer believes that no violation has occurred,
                    the Code Officer will notify the person(s) reporting the
                    potential violation, and no further action is required;
                 -  Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code
                    Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the
                    Audit Committee;

<Page>

                 -  If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has
                    occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the
                    Board, which will consider appropriate action, which may
                    include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                    applicable policies and procedures; notification to the
                    Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or a
                    recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered Officer;
                 -  The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers
                    in its sole discretion;
                 -  Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                    required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

                 The Chief Legal Officer shall:

                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals
                    provided in accordance with Section III of this Code; and
                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations of,
                    or material issues arising under, this Code.

     VI.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                 This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds
            for the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
            rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies
            thereunder. Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Funds or
            the Funds' Service Providers govern or purport to govern the
            behavior or activities (including, but not limited to, personal
            trading activities) of the Covered Officers who are subject to this
            Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
            overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and
            their investment advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of
            ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and any policies and
            procedures of the Service Providers are separate requirements
            applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

     VII.   AMENDMENTS

                 All material amendments to this Code must be approved or
            ratified by the Board, including a majority of independent
            directors.

     VIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

                 All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this
            Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
            protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this
            Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
            Board, the Covered Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code
            Officer, outside audit firms and legal counsel to the Funds, and
            senior management of Columbia Management Group.

<Page>

     IX.    INTERNAL USE

                 The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds
            and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund,
            as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

I, William R. Parmentier, Jr., certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Liberty All-Star Equity Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
            to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared;

     (b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
            our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
            reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
            statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles;

     (c)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
            and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
            the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

     (d)    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
            control over financial reporting that occurred during the
            registrant's second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
            report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
            materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
            reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
