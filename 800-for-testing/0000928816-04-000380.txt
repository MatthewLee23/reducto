SEMIANNUAL REPORT ON PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK

From the Trustees

John A. Hill and
George Putnam, III

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

In the first months of 2004, we have continued to see the same positive
conditions in financial markets that arose during the recovery of 2003.
The U.S. economy and corporate profits have grown impressively based on
a solid foundation of rising productivity, low inflation, and low
interest rates. With both consumer spending and business capital
investment contributing to the expansion, the economy also shows greater
equilibrium than has been the case in recent years. These favorable
economic conditions have contributed to strong returns in both the stock
and bond markets over the reporting period.

Experience teaches us that a run of good news like this does not give
reason to be complacent. Rather, in such an environment, active research
plays an even more important role in evaluating potential risks.
Uncertainties include the possibilities of a rise in interest rates and
the adverse effects of a weaker U.S. dollar. Putnam's investment
management teams are focused on analyzing these and similar issues. They
are also working to identify new opportunities, which may be less
abundant than they were in last year's broad rally.

The first half of your fund's fiscal year occurred during a highly
favorable period for both convertible and high-yield bonds. Because of
the stock market's strong performance during the six-month period, the
fund's convertible bond holdings had especially robust returns --
returns that we consider unlikely to recur over the near term. The fund
was held back somewhat by its allocation to high-yield bonds, which,
despite a strong showing, underperformed convertible bonds.
Nevertheless, we believe this diversification is advantageous for
shareholders over the long term, as it is designed to reduce volatility.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III
Chairman of the Trustees      President of the Funds

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

 * For the semiannual period ending February 29, 2004, Putnam High Income
   Bond Fund had total returns of 14.77% at net asset value (NAV) and
   12.29% at market price.

 * Due to management's selection of several strong-performing securities,
   especially in the convertible portion of the portfolio, the fund at NAV
   outperformed the 12.75% return of its benchmark, the Merrill Lynch
   All-Convertible Index.

 * The fund's return at NAV slightly outperformed the average return of
   14.51% for the Lipper Convertible Securities Funds (closed-end)
   category. Comparisons in this category can be problematic, however,
   because at period-end it consisted of only 14 funds.

 * We believe the fund's slightly lower return at market price could be
   due, in part, to investor concerns that the stronger-than-normal
   performance in these markets during the past 18 months may be nearing an
   end. (Market price returns generally reflect changes in investor demand
   as well.)

 * See the Performance Summary that begins on page 7 for complete fund
   performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

Over the past six months, the extraordinarily favorable environment for
convertible and high-yield corporate bonds continued the trend of the
previous nine months. After three years of negative returns, the stock
market rallied strongly, helping to boost convertible securities.
Default rates continued to decline, credit quality improved as companies
retired or refinanced debt, and investor demand for convertible and
high-yield bonds was strong. We focused on fundamental research to
select individual securities, many of which performed well. This
strategy helped the fund to out perform its benchmark index and its
Lipper category average, which contained only convertible securities,
based on results at NAV.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam High Income Bond Fund seeks to provide high current income in a
portfolio of high-yielding convertible and nonconvertible securities
with potential for capital appreciation. The fund invests, under normal
circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets in bonds rated below
investment grade.



Market overview

Since convertible securities are tied to the equity markets by their
ability to convert to the underlying common stocks of their issuing
companies, the stock market is an important driver of convertible bond
performance. High-yield bonds can also benefit from an improving stock
market, because rising equity valuations help improve debt/equity ratios
in corporate balance sheets. Of course, the contrary is also true -- a
declining stock market can have a negative effect on both convertible
and high-yield bonds.

The fund's fiscal year began in the midst of an economic recovery. Key
economic indicators such as productivity, manufacturing growth, capital
spending, and consumer confidence became increasingly positive while
inflation remained in check. These favorable economic reports helped
propel the stock market higher, bolstering the returns of your fund's
convertible holdings. Moreover, the more volatile sectors in the stock
market, including technology and telecommunications, saw the strongest
performance.

The best-performing portion of the convertible market contained bonds
with  underlying equities that had had significant price declines (known
as "busted convertibles") during the three-year bear market from 2000 to
2002, and these  securities recovered strongly in 2003.

The narrowing of credit yield spreads (the difference in yield between
high-rated and low-rated bonds) continued to indicate that, as news
about the economy grew more positive, investors seeking higher yields
were becoming more willing to take on credit risk. The fact that
short-term interest rates have been at historically low levels provided
investors with more incentive to seek higher yields.

Strategy overview

While most of the fund's convertible holdings appreciated during the
period, those with greater equity sensitivity -- i.e., those that
generally perform better when the prices of the underlying stocks
appreciate (and worse when the stocks decline) -- had the strongest
performance. We continued to focus primarily on "busted convertibles,"
which are securities that have seen large price declines (in both the
convertible and the underlying stock price). Some of the fund's busted
convertibles benefited from dramatic corporate turnarounds, causing
their prices to recover to a greater extent than we had anticipated.

We also increased the number of "mandatory" convertibles in the fund.
Unlike a traditional convertible, which converts to the underlying stock
only if that stock reaches a certain price, mandatory convertibles
automatically convert to stock after a specified period of time. As a
result, these securities are more sensitive to the stock market's
performance than traditional convertibles, and, because of the strong
stock market in 2003, the fund's higher allocation to mandatory
convertibles was beneficial for performance.

In the high-yield portion of the fund, we maintained diversity across
industry sectors and holdings, which is designed to help protect the
fund against increased market volatility. As yields have declined
throughout the market, we continued to focus on selectively adding
lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds to the portfolio.

How fund holdings affected performance

Within the busted convertible part of the convertible market, the fund
invested in a significant position in Northrop Grumman, the defense
contractor. As the post-9/11 terrorism concerns have receded, the stock
prices of several defense companies have declined to pre-9/11 levels.
The Northrop Grumman issue came with an attractive yield, is backed by a
large, solid company, and exemplifies the types of holdings we have been
seeking for the fund.

The increase in the fund's holdings of mandatory convertibles toward the
end of the period, while not large, contributed positively to returns.
The credit quality of these securities tends to be higher than that of
busted convertibles, and in this environment, with the potential for
interest rates to rise sometime this year, we feel mandatory
convertibles provide attractive risk-return characteristics because of
their equity sensitivity -- contingent, of course, on continued positive
stock market performance.

One example of a troubled holding that performed well was Silicon
Graphics, a technology company specializing in three-dimensional
graphics and animation, desktop workstations, and Web servers. Early in
2004, the company restructured its convertible bonds, resulting in
securities that were much more sensitive to its underlying stock price.
Shortly after this restructuring, the company's stock more than doubled,
boosting the value of the fund's Silicon Graphics holdings
significantly. We sold approximately two-thirds of the position shortly
before the end of the period and realized an attractive gain for the
fund.

In the high-yield portion of the fund, nearly all of the holdings in the
portfolio contributed positively to returns. Among the fund's larger
positions, cable television company Charter Communications was one of the
top performers. While the firm faced competitive and financial pressures,
the company met expectations and management's moves to refinance debt eased
investor concerns about the company's liquidity.

In addition, finance company Finova Group provided solid returns. The
company had encountered significant difficulties a few years ago,
particularly in its airplane leasing business. The firm has worked to
liquidate assets and manage its sizeable portfolio of loans, and was
helped by a significant loan in 2001 from noted investor Warren Buffett
through a joint venture. The company repaid the loan earlier this year,
ahead of schedule, and prospects for the airline sector have improved
more than expected.

Our sizeable stake in the chemicals sector, where we were more heavily
weighted than the index, also boosted returns, including investments in
Huntsman International, a major producer of basic chemicals and
petrochemicals like ethylene and propylene, and Millennium America (a
subsidiary of Millennium Chemicals*), which owns three specialty
chemical businesses. Although energy prices were high, leading to
skepticism about the sector's prospects, this cyclical sector benefited
from the improving economy.

Among the fund's few detractors during the period were high-yield bonds
issued by Solutia, a diversified specialty chemical company. The firm
made news when it settled a high-profile PCB contamination lawsuit in
Alabama, and appeared to be on its way to working out balance sheet
problems. However, the company surprised the market by filing for
bankruptcy. We eliminated the bonds from the portfolio, although we
still hold a small warrant position, which gives the fund's management
the option to purchase the company's stock in the future.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in
the future.


The fund's management teams

The fund is managed by the Putnam Large-Cap Value and Core Fixed-Income
High-Yield teams. The members of the Large-Cap Value Team are David King
(Portfolio Leader), Mike Abata, Bart Geer, Deborah Kuenstner, Cole
Lannum, Christopher Miller, Jeanne Mockard, and Hugh Mullin. The members
of the Core Fixed-Income High-Yield Team are Norm Boucher, Jeffrey
Kaufman, Geoffrey Kelley, Stephen Peacher, Neil Reiner, Paul Scanlon,
Rosemary Thomsen, and Joseph Towell.

* After the close of the reporting period, Lyondell Chemical Co.,
  another fund holding, agreed to acquire Millennium Chemicals Inc. This
  transaction would also involve a third fund holding, Equistar Chemicals
  LP, which is currently 70% owned by Lyondell and 30% owned by
  Millennium. Announcement of this merger had a substantial impact on
  Millennium's stock price; however, thus far it has had little impact on
  the prices of these bonds or their credit profiles.



The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
teams' plans for responding to them.

The fund's returns over this six-month period have been much higher than
the historical average for these types of securities because of optimal
conditions. There has been tremendous stimulus in the form of tax cuts,
a weaker dollar, increased government spending, and interest rates that
have been at historically low levels for some time. Meanwhile, there
have been few clear signs from the Federal Reserve Board that
significant tightening will occur in 2004. The increased willingness
among investors to accept risk has helped boost the capital markets,
which has also provided economic stimulus.

While we believe it is not likely that the performance of the past six
months will be repeated in the near future, that doesn't necessarily
mean, in our view, that the environment for these markets will turn
negative. The economy is still in a relatively early stage of its
recovery, and this economic backdrop has historically been conducive to
solid performance for these types of securities. We are cautiously
optimistic about the fund's prospects for the remainder of 2004, and we
believe that solid returns from individual securities can be attained.
We will seek to uncover those opportunities, and, as always, monitor
economic and market developments and make necessary adjustments to the
portfolio as we see fit.


The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Lower-rated bonds
may offer higher yields in return for more risk.

automatically apply to all shareholders except those who notify us. If
you would prefer to receive your own copy, please call Putnam at

A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number
of the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net
investment income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting
period and the most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed
here may not match the sources listed in the Statement of operations
because the distributions are determined on a tax basis and may be paid
in a different period from the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results, per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

Notes to financial statements
February 29, 2004 (Unaudited)


Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam High Income Bond Fund (the "fund"), is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The fund seeks to provide high current
income by investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of high-yielding
convertible and nonconvertible securities with the potential for capital
appreciation. The fund invests in higher yielding, lower rated bonds
that have a higher rate of default due to the nature of the investments.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at fair value on the basis
of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or dealers,
approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine valuations
for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using
methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and
various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders,
between securities. Many securities markets and exchanges outside the
U.S. close prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange and
therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such
exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain
days, the fund will fair value foreign securities taking into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. securities markets.
The number of days on which fair value prices will be used will depend
on market activity and it is possible that fair value prices will be
used by the fund to a significant extent. Securities quoted in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other
investments, including restricted securities, are valued at fair value
following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed  periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account The fund may transfer uninvested cash balances,
including cash collateral received under security lending arrangements,
into a joint trading account along with the cash of other registered
investment companies and certain other accounts managed by Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. These balances may be
invested in issuers of high-grade short-term investments having
maturities of up to 397 days for collateral received under security
lending arrangements and up to 90 days for other cash investments.

C) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income, net
of applicable holding taxes, is recognized on the ex-dividend date
except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recognized as
soon as the fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash
dividends, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the
securities received.

All premiums/discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity
basis.

D) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

E) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Forward currency contracts outstanding at
period end, if any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

F) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk
of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will
bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the cash
collateral. Income from securities lending is included in investment
income on the statement of operations. At February 29, 2004, the value
of securities loaned amounted to $2,704,897. The fund received cash
collateral of $2,796,349 which is pooled with collateral of other Putnam
funds into 10 issuers of high grade short-term investments.

G) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), as amended.
Therefore, no provision has been made for federal taxes on income,
capital gains or unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for
excise tax on income and capital gains.

At August 31, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $24,507,868
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover   Expiration
- --------------------------------
    $4,424,357   August 31, 2008
     1,283,239   August 31, 2009
     9,205,575   August 31, 2010
     9,594,697   August 31, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending August 31, 2004 $139,111 of losses recognized during the period
November 1, 2002 to August 31, 2003.

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $110,700,755, resulting
in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $14,739,225 and
$4,574,795, respectively, or net unrealized appreciation of $10,164,430.

H) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.


Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the annual rate of 0.75% of the average weekly net assets of
the fund.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor serving agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended February 29, 2004,
the fund paid PFTC $94,386 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. The fund also reduced expenses through
brokerage service arrangements. For the six months ended February 29,
2004, the fund's expenses were reduced by $1,037 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $746, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have served
as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension Plan are
equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and meeting fees for
the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense for the fund is
included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of
operations. Accrued pension liability is included in Payable for Trustee
compensation and expenses in the statement of assets and liabilities.


Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended February 29, 2004, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $32,232,242 and $35,645,856, respectively. There
were no purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.


Note 4
Regulatory matters and litigation

On April 8, 2004, Putnam Management entered into agreements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities
Division representing a final settlement of all charges brought
against Putnam Management by those agencies on October 28, 2003 in
connection with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees
and, in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts
Securities Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered
401(k) plans. The settlement with the SEC requires Putnam Management
to pay $5 million in disgorgement plus a civil monetary penalty of
$50 million, and the settlement with the Massachusetts Securities
Division requires Putnam Management to pay $5 million in restitution
and an administrative fine of $50 million. The settlements also
leave intact the process established under an earlier partial
settlement with the SEC under which Putnam Management agreed to pay
the amount of restitution determined by an independent consultant,
which may exceed the disgorgement and restitution amounts specified
above, pursuant to a plan to be developed by the independent
consultant.

Putnam Management, and not the investors in any Putnam fund, will
bear all costs, including restitution, civil penalties and
associated legal fees stemming from both of these proceedings. The
SEC's and Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and
related matters also serve as the general basis for numerous
lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits filed against
Putnam Management and certain related parties, including certain
Putnam funds. Putnam Management has agreed to bear any costs
incurred by Putnam funds in connection with these lawsuits. Based on
currently available information, Putnam Management believes that the
likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class
action lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the
fund is remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially
affect its ability to provide investment management services to its
clients, including the Putnam funds.

Review of these matters by counsel for Putnam Management and by
separate independent counsel for the Putnam funds and their
independent Trustees is continuing.

Item 10. Controls and Procedures:
- ---------------------------------

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded, based on their evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of
the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, that the design and
operation of such procedures are generally effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
the investment company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms.

Although such officers reached the conclusion expressed in the
preceding paragraph, they are aware of matters that raise concerns
with respect to controls, each of which arose in connection with the
administration of 401(k) plans by Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company.
The first matter, which occurred in early 2001, involved the willful
circumvention of controls by certain Putnam employees in connection
with the correction of operational errors with respect to a 401(k)
client's investment in certain Putnam Funds, which led to losses in
five Putnam Funds (not including the registrant). Such officers
became aware of this matter in February 2004. The second matter,
which occurred in 2002, involved the willful circumvention by
certain Putnam employees of policies and procedures in connection
with the payment of Putnam corporate expenses. Such officers did
not learn that this matter involved a Putnam Fund until January
2004. Putnam has made restitution to the affected Funds,
implemented a number of personnel changes, including senior
personnel, begun to implement changes in procedures to address these
items and informed the SEC, the Funds' Trustees and independent
auditors. An internal investigation and review of procedures and
controls are currently ongoing.

In reaching the conclusion expressed herein, the registrant's

Attachment A:

2. Based on my knowledge, each report does not contain any untrue

covered by each report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in each report, fairly present in all material

periods presented in each report;

4. The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the

control over financial reporting.

5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to
each registrant's auditors and the audit committee of each registrant's
board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect each registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in each registrant's internal
controls.
