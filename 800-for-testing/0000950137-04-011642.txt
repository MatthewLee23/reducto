ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index does not include any expenses,
fees or sales charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and
should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in
an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2004

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals is managed by the
Adviser's Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis
Pietrzak, Executive Director; Robert Wimmel, Vice President; and John
Reynoldson, Executive Director.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The interest-rate environment of the 12 months ended October 31, 2004 was marked
by two periods of steadily declining yields, with a significant sell-off in the
middle. Yields fell steadily through the first half of the period, approaching
the historical lows of 2003. This trend persisted until March, at which point
yields reversed direction and began an upward march as prices fell. These losses
were steepest in April, as a surprisingly strong employment report and signals
from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") caused investors
to expect a near-term rate increase. Rates went on to decline from May through
the end of the period as the market digested the Fed's newly hawkish rate
stance. Investors were further comforted when, after the Fed raised rates at its
June 30, 2004 meeting, its members indicated that the path of future rate
increases would be measured.

Unusually, longer-maturity securities largely outperformed in this period of Fed
tightening. Historically, the typical pattern in periods of tightening policy
has seen yields rise across all maturities. During the review period, however,
yields of shorter maturity bonds rose while those of bonds with longer
maturities declined slightly.

Lower-quality municipal bonds also performed strongly in this environment, as
the difference in yields (known as the "yield spread") between AAA and BBB rated
bonds decreased by roughly 20 basis points for 20-year bonds. As a result,
sectors with heavy exposure to lower-rated debt, such as hospitals and
industrial-revenue bonds, posted higher total returns than sectors dominated by
higher-rated debt.

Issuance for the first 10 months of 2004 (the final 10 months of the review
period) was roughly six percent lower than in the same period in 2003. That
said, 2003 was a record year, and at the current pace of issuance, 2004 could
well be one of the largest years in recent memory. The strong supply met with
faltering demand from mutual funds, as fund investors withdrew over $15 billion
in net cash during the period. This faltering demand was largely offset by
increased participation in the market by insurance companies and individual
investors.

<PAGE>

While New York was still among the largest issuers in the country during the
period, its overall issuance fell by 18 percent for the first nine months of
2004 relative to the same period in 2003. Many local municipalities moved to
take advantage of relatively low interest rates during the period by refinancing
their existing debt. The state's ongoing economic improvement led to an upgrade
by Moody's.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly, as they did during the reporting period. On an
NAV basis, the trust outperformed its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers New York
Municipal Bond Index. (See table below.)

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates in the final months of the period made the trust's
borrowing activity more expensive. These expenses, however, were more than
offset by the strong performance of the bonds we invested in, leading to the
trust's outperformance versus its benchmark, which is unleveraged.

Interest rates spent much of the period at or near historic lows. Given these
levels, our analysis indicated that there was little room for rates to fall
further, and that as a result, rates were more likely to go up than down over
the intermediate term. This analysis led us to reduce the trust's interest-rate
sensitivity to a level that was less than that of its benchmark. While this
approach served the trust well when rates rose in the late spring and early
summer, it was an overall drag on performance for the one-year period.

With interest rates at such low levels, several of the trust's holdings were
called away by issuers seeking to refinance their bonds at lower yields. Several
of the

trust's shorter maturity bonds were also prerefunded, and we sold many of these
securities to take advantage of more compelling opportunities elsewhere. We
reinvested the proceeds into securities that we believed had attractive total-
return prospects, emphasizing bonds in the 13- to 18-year portion of the yield
curve, especially those with the relatively lower interest-rate sensitivity.
These bonds offer the dual benefit of a strong income stream and moderate
vulnerability to shifting interest rates.

We continued to pursue relative-value opportunities at the long end of the
market, buying securities when they offered attractive value and selling them
once they met our performance targets in order to reinvest the proceeds
elsewhere.

We remained focused on keeping the trust's risk profile within a reasonable
range through attention to credit quality and diversification. By the end of the
12-month period, more than 81 percent of the trust's total investments were
invested in bonds rated AAA and AA; these represent the two highest tiers of
credit ratings. The portfolio was also well diversified across the major sectors
of the municipal bond market. Its three largest sector exposures were
transportation, general purpose, and public building.

While it is impossible to predict the exact turning point when interest rates
will move decisively higher, we believe the trust remains well positioned for
the near future. We will continue to comb the municipal bond markets for
interesting opportunities.

There is no guarantee that any securities mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the trust in the future.

   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began

   income per share by $.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
   losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment income to

   period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of
   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period
   indicated.

(c)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- OCTOBER 31, 2004

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment. The Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.
Effective November 30, 2003, the Fund's investment adviser, Van Kampen
Investment Advisory Corp. merged into its affiliate, Van Kampen Asset Management
(the "Adviser").

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At October 31, 2004, the Trust had $3,791,632 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gain/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Permanent book and tax
differences relating to excise taxes paid which are not deductible for tax
purposes totaling $1,149 were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to paid in surplus.

    As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .60% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. Effective November
1, 2004, the investment advisory fee was reduced from .60% to .55%. In addition,
the Trust paid a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc. or
its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen"), the Trust's Administrator, at an
annual rate of .05% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. Effective June
1, 2004, the administrative fee was reduced from .05% to .00%.

    For the year ended October 31, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $11,500 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the
Trust is a partner who provides legal services to the Trust, and is therefore an
affiliated person.

                                                                              17

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen Trust for Investment
Grade New York Municipals:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2004, the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits. The Trust's financial highlights for
the periods ended prior to October 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose
report, dated December 6, 1999, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2004, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals as of October 31, 2004,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the respective stated periods, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in Common Shares of the Trust. The Trust declares dividends out of
net investment income, and will distribute annually net realized capital gains,
if any. Common Shareholders may join or withdraw from the Plan at any time.

    If you decide to participate in the Plan, State Street Bank and Trust
Company, as your Plan Agent, will automatically invest your dividends and
capital gains distributions in Common Shares of the Trust for your account.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE

    If you wish to participate and your shares are held in your own name, call
1-800-341-2929 for more information and a Plan brochure. If your shares are held
in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your
nominee to see if it would participate in the Plan on your behalf. If you wish
to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage firm, bank or nominee is unable
to participate on your behalf, you should request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name which will enable your participation in the Plan.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common Shares valued
on the valuation date, generally at the lower of market price or net asset
value, except as specified below. The valuation date will be the dividend or
distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the national
securities exchange or market system on which the Common Shares are listed for
trading, the next preceding trading day. If the market price per Common Share on
the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per Common Share on that
date, the Trust will issue new Common Shares to participants valued at the
higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price on the valuation date. In
the foregoing situation, the Trust will not issue Common Shares under the Plan
below net asset value. If net asset value per Common Share on the valuation date
exceeds the market price per Common Share on that date, or if the Board of
Trustees should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable to the
Common Shareholders only in cash, participants in the Plan will be deemed to
have elected to receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at the market price
on that date. Accordingly, in this circumstance, the Plan Agent will, as agent
for the participants, buy the Trust's Common Shares in the open market for the
participants' accounts on or shortly after the payment date. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
per share of the Common Shares, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

of the Trust's Common Shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common
Shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
issued by the Trust. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common Shares
and are carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
changes sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90 days before the
record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Agent by at least 90 days written notice to all Common
Shareholders of the Trust.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
prorata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    Plan participants may withdraw at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 8200, Boston, MA
02266-8200. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan and a cash payment will be made for any fractional Common
Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

(a) The Trust has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that applies
to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Trust or a third
party.

(b) No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) The Trust has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by the
shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C have been amended.

(d) Not applicable.

(e) Not applicable.

(f)

         (1)      The Trust's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit 11A.
         (2)      Not applicable.
         (3)      Not applicable.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has three "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees : J. Miles Branagan, Jerry Choate and R. Craig Kennedy.
Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit
committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee
financial expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties,
obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and
liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different
period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and
pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent Auditors
without obtaining specific pre-approval
- ----------

(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.
(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.


2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix
B.1. All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).


4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.


<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large
and complex transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be
provided by the Independent Auditors to any executive officer or
trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual
capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable
only to internally managed investment companies).


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

         A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.


7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.


9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.


10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:


     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

(g) See table above.

(h) The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the

(a) The Trust has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are:

within 90 days of the filing date of the report.

 (b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year
(the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
              ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED SEPTEMBER 22, 2004



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment

<PAGE>

Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to
have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly);

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         o        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;
<PAGE>

         o        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         o        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         o        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         o        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         o        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         o        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a

- ----------
(3) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
    a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."



<PAGE>

                           recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or
                           other appropriate disciplinary actions;

                  o        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                           Partners of the relevant Fund will be responsible for
                           granting waivers of this Code, as appropriate; and

                  o        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the
                           extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC
                           rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or
C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.



<PAGE>




VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

                  financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to

                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report

         b)       any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the

         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
         include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         a)       designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

         b)       [Omitted]

         c)       evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

         d)       disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         a)       all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

         b)       any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal controls over financial reporting.
