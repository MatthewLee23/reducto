       FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2005

Dear Shareholders:

The market price performance of the First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), as well as its peers, has confounded investors
and investment professionals alike over the past year. Based on market price,
the Fund's total return was -6.2% for the 12-month period ended May 31, 2005,
yet its net asset value ("NAV") total return was 4.4%. In comparison, the
benchmark Standard & Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index return over the same
period was 4.4%. The Fund traded at a 5.5% discount to its NAV on May 31, 2005.
Its current distribution rate closed out the fiscal year at 6.2%.

In theory, senior loans should garner greater attention from the investing
public whenever the U.S. economy is in an expansion mode. Demand tends to pick
up even more when short-term interest rates are on the rise. Senior loans are
more speculative in nature than investment-grade securities, and as a result
investors recognize a more favorable risk/reward tradeoff when short-term rates
are rising, not only because of the floating rate component, which can boost
income as the loans reset, but because such a trend is usually fueled by strong
economic growth. The concern over credit quality also tends to lessen when the
economy is expanding at a solid and sustainable pace.

What has many perplexed is the disparity in the performance of the market prices
of senior loan closed-end funds, which have declined sharply from their highs
posted in the first half of 2004, and the performance of the senior loans
themselves, which have traded in a much narrower range. We believe that investor
psychology in the closed-end fund marketplace has been influenced significantly
by the relationship between short-term interest rates and intermediate-term
interest rates. Normally, when short-term interest rates rise to the extent that
they have since last June, it is common for intermediate-term rates to follow -
at least to some degree. In the current economic expansion, that has simply not
been the case. In fact, the yield on the 10-year T-Note actually declined since
the Fed began tightening last June. Short-term rates have risen from 1.0% to
3.0%, yet the yield on the 10-year has declined from 4.6% to 4.0% from June 30,
2004, through May 31, 2005. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has come to
characterize the flattening of the yield curve as a "conundrum."

Since the inception of the Fund, we have noticed that interest in FCT has picked
up markedly whenever the yield on the 10-year T-Note has risen. The problem has
been that these rate increases, which occurred in the first half of 2004 and the
first quarter of 2005, were not sustained. In both cases the 10-year T-Note
subsequently rallied, resulting in the selling of FCT shares.

It is our contention that the demand for shares of FCT is influenced by the
slope of the yield curve. In May, the National Association for Business
Economics announced that its panel of 50 forecasters sees the yield on the
10-year T-Note rising to 4.9% by the end of 2005. If correct, a move of that
magnitude (about 90 basis points) has been more than enough to attract serious
buying power in the past.

We continue to appreciate your interest in the Fund and encourage you to read
the commentary section from Michael P. McAdams and Robert I. Bernstein,
Co-Portfolio Managers.

Sincerely,


/s/ James A. Bowen

A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund ("FCT" or the
"Fund") posted a market share price total return of -6.2% for the year ended May
31, 2005 ("Fiscal 2005"). The Fund's NAV total return was 4.4% over the same
period. During Fiscal 2005, the Fund declared dividends totaling $0.905 per
share. Based on its most recent dividend, FCT paid a yield of 6.2% based on the
Fund's share price, and 5.9% based on the Fund's NAV, as of May 31, 2005.

The following commentary reviews the economic and market environment in which
the Fund invests, the Fund's investment strategy, portfolio composition and
performance for the year ended May 31, 2005.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Fiscal 2005 was generally marked by a favorable environment for senior
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). The Fund benefited from trends
that are favorable to both floating-rate and credit-focused investing. These
trends include a growing U.S. economy, rising short-term interest rates, strict
credit underwriting standards and low rates of corporate defaults. Gross
Domestic Product ("GDP") growth averaged 3.7% during the last four quarters.
Short-term interest rates were increased eight times by a total of 2.0% during
the Fund's Fiscal 2005. Credit underwriting remains conservative as leverage and
interest coverage multiples remain near historically tight levels. Senior Loan
default rates are well below long-term moving averages at 1.5% as of the end of
Fiscal 2005.

Reflecting strong economic fundamentals, the loan market as a whole recorded
strong growth through Fiscal 2005. New Senior Loan issuance rose significantly,
from $159 billion for the calendar year 2003 to $248 billion for calendar year
2004. Similarly, Senior Loan market liquidity, as measured by trading volume,
grew nearly 10% year-over-year. Likewise, demand for Senior Loans was strong
during the year. Investors perceived reduced levels of credit risk resulting
from an improving economic environment with low levels of defaults and credit
losses, and sought to benefit from the floating-rate nature of Senior Loans.

In rising interest rate environments such as we have seen during the last year,
Senior Loans' income typically rises with a several month lag to actual Fed rate
increases. However, credit spreads declined during the year, reflecting the
strong demand for Senior Loans. This decline in credit spreads offset much of
the increase in short-term rates. Notwithstanding the decline in credit spreads,
the Fund still increased its dividend during the year and had low NAV
volatility.

We remain comfortable that the credit standards of Senior Loans being
underwritten today are well above the levels that contributed to the difficult
default cycle of 2001-2003, and believe that the risk-adjusted returns of Senior
Loans are still very favorable on an absolute basis and when compared with other
asset classes.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

The investment strategy employed in managing the Fund is designed to be an "all
weather" strategy focused on delivering long-term performance through risk
minimization. Many managers of Senior Loan-based closed-end funds invest up to
20% or more of their portfolios in high yield bonds in order to boost yields.
FCT is a "pure play" strategy that is generally prohibited from investing in
high yield bonds, and focuses instead on Senior Loans. In some market
environments, the Fund's pure play strategy will result in lower yields/returns
than some other Senior Loan-based closed-end funds, but in the long run we
believe it should result in lower NAV volatility and higher total NAV returns.

Our investment strategy focuses on thorough fundamental credit analysis, broad
issuer and industry diversification, and a proactive sell discipline in order to
minimize risk. The Fund's portfolio is generally more heavily weighted towards
industry groups that we expect to exhibit lower earnings volatility, and which
we expect to provide high recoveries to senior lenders in circumstances where
earnings volatility does occur. We also tend to minimize exposure to those
industries that are exposed to "crosscurrents" such as changing market demand,
unmanageable costs, undue revenue pressures, or other technical factors. For
example, the Fund has always had very little exposure to the automotive
industry, which has performed poorly based on weak industry fundamentals as
evidenced by the recent downgrades of General Motors and Ford debt.

The Fund is broadly diversified with over 160 positions across 39 industries. At
May 31, 2005, the five largest individual borrower exposures in total
represented 9.8% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund also has the flexibility to
invest up to 10% of the portfolio in Special Situation debt investments, which
are typically investments in companies that are either in default or are
experiencing financial difficulties. We view our ability to make these
investments as opportunistic rather than obligatory, and given the growth and
improvement in the economy during the year, we saw few value opportunities in
this segment of the portfolio. On May 31, the portfolio included 2 Special
Situation investments representing 2.7% of the Fund's portfolio.

        A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE
                          INCOME FUND II - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both adjustable-rate
Auction Market Preferred Shares and an asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
The terms and conditions of the leverage program provide the Fund with the
ability to borrow on a floating-rate basis. Since the income generated by the
Fund's Senior Loan investment portfolio is also floating-rate, the Fund is less
exposed to interest rate mismatch risk than a closed-end fund with a fixed rate
investment portfolio, and investors will generally benefit from portfolio
leverage regardless of the direction of short-term interest rates. At May 31,
2005, the portfolio leverage accounted for 37.5% of the Fund's total managed
assets.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

For Fiscal 2005, the Fund's total return on an NAV basis was 4.4%. This return
was consistent with the benchmark (Standard & Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index)
return of 4.4%. The Fund's performance includes the beneficial impact of
leverage, and the negative impact of fees and expenses and uninvested cash
balances, which are not part of the benchmark return. As mentioned above, 10
months of dividend distributions totaled approximately $0.91 per common share in
Fiscal 2005. The Fund raised its dividend by approximately 5.0% in January to
$0.0927. Additionally, the Fund's NAV was relatively stable during the year,
ranging from a high of $19.22 to a low of $18.86, a range of approximately 1.9%.

The Fund's strong performance during the year was influenced by a number of
factors. We actively sold investments during the year generating substantial
trading gains. We also benefited from favorable sector allocations. In addition
to the above-mentioned underweighting of the poor performing Automotive
industry, we were overweight in the Building and Development and Business
Equipment and Services industries, both of which performed well during the year.
Perhaps most importantly, we had no defaults and very limited distressed sales
during the year, which helped keep NAV volatility low.

Despite the Fund's strong NAV performance/total return and high dividend yield
during Fiscal 2005, the Fund's market price performance was disappointing.
During the year, the market price of the Fund closed as high as $20.20 (July 8,
2004) and as low as $17.32 (May 25, 2005). On June 1, 2004, the Fund's closing
market price on the New York Stock Exchange was $20.00. The Fund's closing price
on May 31, 2005 was $17.89, for a total return at market price of -6.2% for the
year. The Fund closed the year at a 5.5% discount to its NAV.

While we feel strongly that the market price performance of the Fund during the
year is not in concert with the prospects for the overall Senior Loan asset
class or the Fund, we do note that 16 of the 17 Senior Loan closed-end funds
traded at discounts to NAV on May 31, the average of the narrower pure play
group being 5.5%. FCT's market and NAV yield on May 31, 2005 (6.2% and 5.9%,
respectively) compare favorably to the pure play peer group averages of 6.1% and
5.7%, respectively.

On December 30th, Raymond James initiated coverage of the Fund with a `Highly
Recommended' rating, Raymond James' highest rating. On March 11th, Ryan Beck
initiated coverage of the Fund with a `Market Outperform' rating, Ryan Beck's
highest rating. Several other Closed End Fund Analysts publish research on the
Fund, but only within their specific firms.

We remain committed to long-term performance and superior client support, and we
appreciate the opportunity to assist investors in meeting their investment
goals.

            o  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based
               on net assets applicable to Common Shares.

          (a)  This Senior Loan interest was privately rated upon issuance. The
               rating agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the
               rating.

          (b)  Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $756,289,273.

          (c)  This issue is secured by a second lien on the issuer's assets.
               The second lien security interest is subordinated to other debt
               holders.

          (d)  This issue is unsecured.

          (e)  This issue's security interest is subordinated to other debt
               securities.

          (f)  This borrower has filed for protection in a federal bankruptcy
               court.

          (g)  144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration
               under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These
               securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from
               registration which are normally those transactions with qualified
               institutional buyers.

            +  Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- by
               Standard & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below
               investment grade. (Bank loans ratings are unaudited.)

           NR  Not Rated

            *  Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
               prepayment. Because of the mandatory prepayment conditions and
               because there may be significant economic incentives for a
               borrower to prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans may occur. As a
               result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be
               substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans
               generally have maturities that range from five to eight years;
               however, the Fund estimates that refinancing and prepayments
               result in an average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its
               portfolio to be approximately 18-30 months.

           **  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at
               rates which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base
               lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are
               generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major
               European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
               ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
               United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate.
               Senior Loans are generally considered to be restricted in that
               the Fund ordinarily is contractually obligated to receive
               approval from the agent bank and/or borrower prior to the
               disposition of a Senior Loan.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2005

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets. The NAV is determined
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The Fund calculates NAV per Common Share by
subtracting the Fund's liabilities and the liquidation value of any outstanding
Preferred Shares from the Fund's Managed Assets and dividing the result by the
total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value, or in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for
particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before
the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV, First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities
and investments. The use of fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2005

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund instructs the custodian to
segregate assets of the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued purchase commitments.

UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $8,576,160
as of May 31, 2005. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation of $99,732 from these
commitments is included in Other liabilities on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31,
2005, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have been reclassified
at year end to reflect an increase in undistributed net investment income by
$1,546,191 and a decrease in accumulated net realized loss on investments sold
by $1,546,191. Net assets were not affected by this reclassification.


                                                                         Page 21

                                  MAY 31, 2005

The tax character of distributions paid during fiscal year ended May 31, 2005
and the period ended May 31, 2004 is as follows:

Distributions paid from:

                                                      2005           2004

Ordinary Income.................................  $ 24,738,405   $         --
Long-term Capital Gains.........................  $         --   $         --

As of May 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income ..................  $  1,499,092
Net Unrealized Depreciation ....................  $ (2,494,455)

INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

COMMON SHARE ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING COSTS:

Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it
to legally do business. These costs include filing fees, listing fees, legal
services pertaining to the organization of the business and audit fees relating
to the initial registration and auditing the initial statement of assets and
liabilities, among other fees. Offering costs consist of legal fees pertaining
to the Fund's shares offered for sale, registration fees, underwriting fees, and
printing of the initial prospectus, among other fees. First Trust and Four
Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners") have paid all organizational
expenses and all offering costs of the Fund (other than sales load) that
exceeded $0.04 per Common Share. The Fund's estimated share of Common Share
offering costs, $920,000 and $89,209 in 2004 and 2005, respectively, was
recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the sale of Common Shares.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any
outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-adviser and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives a portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
out of the First Trust investment advisory fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Effective June 7, 2004, the Trustees of the Fund approved a revised compensation
plan. Under the revised plan, the Fund pays each Trustee who is not an officer
or employee of First Trust or any of their affiliates an annual retainer of
$10,000 which includes compensation for all regular quarterly board meetings and

meetings and non-regular committee meetings, respectively. These additional fees
are shared by the funds in the First Trust fund complex that participate in the
particular meeting and are not per fund fees. Trustees are also reimbursed for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Trustees
adopted the revised plan because the increase in the number of funds in the
First Trust fund complex had the effect of rapidly increasing their compensation
under the previous arrangements. Prior to June 7, 2004, the Fund paid each
Trustee who was not an officer or employee of First Trust or any of their
affiliates $10,000 per annum plus $1,000 per regularly scheduled meeting
attended, $500 per committee meeting attended and reimbursement for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the year ended May 31, 2005, aggregated amounts were
$1,402,179,920 and $745,664,701, respectively.

As of May 31, 2005, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all
securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,159,855
and the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which
there was an excess of tax cost over value was $4,654,310.

</TABLE>

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of May 31, 2005, the Fund has
2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
outstanding at a liquidation value of $25,000 per share. The AMP Shares offering
costs of $299,751 and commissions of $1,000,000, paid directly to Lehman
Brothers, were charged to capital of Common Shares for the year ended May 31,
2005.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of May 31, 2005 was 3.04% and 3.18% for
the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly
to the income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
Common Shareholders.


                                                                         Page 23

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2005

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

On August 2, 2004 the Fund entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility
among the Fund, various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, which
provides for a Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") to be used as leverage for
the Fund. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the
Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total
assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$195,000,000. For the year ended May 31, 2005, the average amount outstanding
was $122,090,411, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.28%. The Fund also
pays additional borrowing costs, which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a
program fee of 0.20% and a liquidity fee of 0.14% per year. Such expenses are
included in Interest and fees on outstanding loan payable on the Statement of
Operations.

                              8. POST OCTOBER LOSS

Certain losses incurred after October 31 within the Fund's fiscal year are
deemed to arise on the first business day of the Fund's following fiscal year.
For fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, the Fund incurred and elected to defer
$440,571 in capital losses.

                              9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On May 20 2005, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0927 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record June 3, 2005, payable June 15, 2005.

On June 20, 2005, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0927 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record July 6, 2005, payable July 15, 2005.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR
FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2005, the related statement of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, and the statements of changes
in net assets and the financial highlights for the year then ended and for the
period May 18, 2004 (inception) through May 31, 2004. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2005, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers and selling or agent banks. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2005, the
results of its operations and its cash flows, the changes in its net assets, and
the financial highlights for the respective stated periods, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.+

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2005

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect to receive cash distributions,
all dividends, including any capital gain distributions, on your Common Shares
will be automatically reinvested by PFPC (the "Plan Agent"), in additional
Common Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you
will receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by
PFPC, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If the Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value at the
            time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal
            to the greater of (i) net asset value per Common Share on that date
            or (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If the Common Shares are trading below net asset value at the time
            of valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
            distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the open
            market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It
            is possible that the market price for the Common Shares may increase
            before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the
            average purchase price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed
            the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase
            of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
            in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all
            dividends and distributions received in cash to purchase Common
            Shares in the open market within 30 days of the valuation date
            except where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is
            necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest will not
            be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Plan
Agent, or by telephone in accordance with such reasonable requirements as the
Plan Agent and Fund may agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated,
you will receive a certificate for each whole share in your account under the
Plan, and you will receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your
account. If you wish, the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the
proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE  OF  PROXY  VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS, L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors, L.P. (the "ADVISER") serves as investment adviser
providing  discretionary  investment  advisory  services  for  several  open  or
closed-end  investment companies (the "FUNDS").  As part of these services,  the
Adviser  has full  responsibility  for  proxy  voting  and  related  duties.  In
fulfilling  these  duties,  the  Adviser and Funds have  adopted  the  following
policies and procedures:

          1.  It is the  Adviser's  policy to seek to ensure  that  proxies  for
              securities held by a Fund are voted consistently and solely in the
              best economic interests of the respective Fund.

          2.  The Adviser  shall be  responsible  for the  oversight of a Fund's
              proxy voting process and shall assign a senior member of its staff
              to be responsible for this oversight.

          3.  The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional  Shareholder
              Services,  Inc. ("ISS") to make  recommendations to the Adviser on
              the voting of proxies  related to securities  held by a Fund.  ISS
              provides voting  recommendations  based on established  guidelines
              and  practices.  The Adviser has  adopted  these ISS Proxy  Voting
              Guidelines.

          4.  The Adviser  shall review the ISS  recommendations  and  generally
              will vote the  proxies in  accordance  with such  recommendations.
              Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Adviser  may  not  vote  in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations  if the Adviser  believes
              that the specific ISS  recommendation is not in the best interests
              of the respective Fund.

          5.  If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
              any of the Adviser's  clients hold any securities in that company,
              the  Adviser  will  vote  proxies   relating  to  such   company's
              securities in accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid any
              conflict  of  interest.  In  addition,  if the  Adviser has actual
              knowledge  of any other  type of  material  conflict  of  interest
              between itself and the respective  Fund with respect to the voting
              of a  proxy,  the  Adviser  shall  vote  the  applicable  proxy in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations to avoid such conflict of
              interest.

          6.  If  a  Fund  requests  the  Adviser  to  follow   specific  voting
              guidelines or additional guidelines,  the Adviser shall review the
              request and follow such guidelines,  unless the Adviser determines
              that it is unable to follow  such  guidelines.  In such case,  the
              Adviser  shall  inform  the Fund that it is not able to follow the
              Fund's request.

          7.  The Adviser  may have  clients in addition to the Funds which have
              provided the Adviser with discretionary  authority to vote proxies
              on their behalf.  In such cases, the Adviser shall follow the same
              policies and procedures.

EXHIBIT B

ISS 2005 PROXY VOTING

GUIDELINES SUMMARY

The following is a condensed version of all proxy voting recommendations
contained in the ISS Proxy Voting Manual.

1. OPERATIONAL ITEMS

ADJOURN MEETING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to provide management with the authority to
adjourn an annual or special meeting absent compelling reasons to support the
proposal.

Vote FOR proposals that relate specifically to soliciting votes for a merger or
transaction for which ISS has recommended a FOR vote. Vote AGAINST proposals if
the wording is too vague or if the proposal includes "other business."

AMEND QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings
below a majority of the shares outstanding unless there are compelling reasons
to support the proposal.

AMEND MINOR BYLAWS

Vote FOR bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (updates or
corrections).

CHANGE COMPANY NAME

Vote FOR proposals to change the corporate name.

CHANGE DATE, TIME, OR LOCATION OF ANNUAL MEETING

Vote FOR management proposals to change the date/time/location of the annual
meeting unless the proposed change is unreasonable.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to change the date/time/location of the
annual meeting unless the current scheduling or location is unreasonable.

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

o     An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company,
      and is therefore not independent

o     Fees for non-audit services are excessive, or

o     There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an
      opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
      financial position.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for audit firm rotation,
taking into account the tenure of the audit firm, the length of rotation
specified in the proposal, any significant audit-related issues at the company,
the number of Audit Committee meetings held each year, the number of financial
experts serving on the

<PAGE>

committee, and whether the company has a periodic renewal process where the
auditor is evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price.

TRANSACT OTHER BUSINESS

Vote AGAINST proposals to approve other business when it appears as voting item.

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS

Votes on director nominees should be made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, examining the
following factors: composition of the board and key board committees, attendance
at board meetings, corporate governance provisions and takeover activity,
long-term company performance relative to a market index, directors' investment
in the company, whether the chairman is also serving as CEO, and whether a
retired CEO sits on the board. However, there are some actions by directors that
should result in votes being withheld. These instances include directors who:

o     Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without a
      valid excuse

o     Implement or renew a dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill

o     Adopt a poison pill without shareholder approval since the company's last
      annual meeting and there is no requirement to put the pill to shareholder
      vote within 12 months of its adoption

o     Ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of the shares
      outstanding

o     Ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of the votes
      cast for two consecutive years

o     Failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the shareholders
      tendered their shares

o     Are inside directors or affiliated outsiders and sit on the audit,
      compensation, or nominating committees

o     Are inside directors or affiliated outsiders and the full board serves as
      the audit, compensation, or nominating committee or the company does not
      have one of these committees

o     Are audit committee members and the non -audit fees paid to the auditor
      are excessive.

In addition, directors who enacted egregious corporate governance policies or
failed to replace management as appropriate would be subject to recommendations
to withhold votes.

o     Are inside directors or affiliated outside directors and the full board is
      less than majority independent

o     Sit on more than six public company boards, or on more than two public
      boards in addition to their own if they are CEOs of public companies.

o     Are on the compensation committee when there is a negative correlation
      between chief executive pay and company performance

o     Have failed to address the issue(s) that resulted in any of the directors
      receiving more than 50% withhold votes out of those cast at the previous
      board election

AGE LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors either through term limits or mandatory retirement ages.

BOARD SIZE

Vote FOR proposals seeking to fix the board size or designate a range for the
board size.

Vote AGAINST proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the
board outside of a specified range without shareholder approval.

CLASSIFICATION/DECLASSIFICATION OF THE BOARD

Vote AGAINST proposals to classify the board.

Vote FOR proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors
annually.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.

Vote proposals to restore or permit cumulative voting on a CASE-BY-CASE basis
based on the extent that shareholders have access to the board through their own
nominations.

<PAGE>

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY PROTECTION

Proposals on director and officer indemnification and liability protection
should be evaluated on a CASE-BYCASE basis, using Delaware law as the standard.

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability
for monetary damages for violating the duty of care.

Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just
legal expenses to acts, such as negligence, that are more serious violations of
fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness.

Vote FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the following
apply:

o     The director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner that he
      reasonably believed was in the best interests of the company, and

o     Only if the director's legal expenses would be covered.

ESTABLISH/AMEND NOMINEE QUALIFICATIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals that establish or amend director qualifications.
Votes should be based on how reasonable the criteria are and to what degree they
may preclude dissident nominees from joining the board. Vote AGAINST shareholder
proposals requiring two candidates per board seat.

FILLING VACANCIES/REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

Vote AGAINST proposals that provide that directors may be removed only for
cause.

Vote FOR proposals to restore shareholder ability to remove directors with or
without cause.

Vote AGAINST proposals that provide that only continuing directors may elect
replacements to fill board vacancies.

Vote FOR proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board
vacancies.

INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN (SEPARATE CHAIRMAN/CEO)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring the position of chairman be
filled by an independent director unless there are compelling reasons to
recommend against the proposal, such as a counterbalancing governance structure.
This should include all of the following:

o     Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
      members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role may
      alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman, or rotating
      lead director).

o     Two-thirds independent board

o     All-independent key committees

o     Established governance guidelines

Additionally, the company should not have under-performed its peers.

MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be
independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by
ISS's definition of independence.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or
nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors if they
currently do not meet that standard.

OPEN ACCESS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for open access taking into
account the ownership threshold specified in the proposal and the proponent's
rationale for targeting the company in terms of board and director conduct.

<PAGE>

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While ISS favors stock ownership on the part of directors, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE shareholder proposals asking that the company adopt a holding
or retention period for its executives (for holding stock after the vesting or
exercise of equity awards), taking into account any stock ownership requirements
or holding period/retention ratio already in place and the actual ownership
level of executives.

TERM LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors either through term limits or mandatory retirement ages.

3. PROXY CONTESTS

VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS

Votes in a contested election of directors must be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, considering the following factors:

o     Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
      industry; management's track record

o     Background to the proxy contest

o     Qualifications of director nominees (both slates)

o     Evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders as well as the
      likelihood that the proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock
      ownership positions.

REIMBURSING PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

Voting to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses should be analyzed on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. In cases where ISS recommends in favor of the dissidents, we
also recommend voting for reimbursing proxy solicitation expenses.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that corporations adopt confidential
voting, use independent vote tabulators and use independent inspectors of
election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy contests as
follows: In the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to
request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the
dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents will not agree,
the confidential voting policy is waived.

Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

4. ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES AND VOTING RELATED ISSUES

Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations

Votes on advance notice proposals are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, giving
support to those proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals as close
to the meeting date as reasonably possible and within the broadest window
possible.

AMEND BYLAWS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.

Vote FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
to shareholders.

<PAGE>

pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it.

shareholder vote.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

action by written consent.

Vote FOR proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written
consent.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call
special meetings.

Vote FOR proposals that remove restrictions on the right of shareholders to act
independently of management.

o     Anticipated use of funds

o     Conflicts of interest.

BUNDLED PROPOSALS

Review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

In the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, examine the benefits
and costs of the packaged items.

In instances when the joint effect of the conditioned items is not in
shareholders' best interests, vote against the proposals. If the combined effect
is positive, support such proposals.

<PAGE>

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Votes on proposals regarding conversion of securities are determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. When evaluating these proposals the investor should review
the dilution to existing shareholders, the conversion price relative to market
value, financial issues, control issues, termination penalties, and conflicts of
interest.

Vote FOR the conversion if it is expected that the company will be subject to
onerous penalties or will be forced to file for bankruptcy if the transaction is

o     Regulatory benefits

o     Increases in capital structure

<PAGE>

issues, management's efforts to pursue other alternatives, control issues, and
conflicts of interest.

Vote FOR the private placement if it is expected that the company will file for
bankruptcy if the transaction is not approved.

VALUE MAXIMIZATION PROPOSALS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals seeking to maximize shareholder value
by hiring a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives, selling the
company or liquidating the company and distributing the proceeds to
shareholders. These proposals should be evaluated based on the following
factors: prolonged poor performance with no turnaround in sight, signs of
entrenched board and management, strategic plan in place for improving value,
likelihood of receiving reasonable value in a sale or dissolution, and whether
company is actively exploring its strategic options, including retaining a
financial advisor.

6. STATE OF INCORPORATION

CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION PROVISIONS

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share cashout statutes.

<PAGE>

DISGORGEMENT PROVISIONS

Review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis antigreenmail proposals when they are bundled
with other charter or bylaw amendments.

REINCORPORATION PROPOSALS

pill endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, antigreenmail
provisions, and disgorgement provisions).

7. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK

Vote FOR management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock.

COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION

Votes on proposals to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized
for issuance are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a model developed by
ISS.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital structures to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond the allowable increase when a
company's shares are in danger of being delisted or if a company's ability to
continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.

<PAGE>

DUAL-CLASS STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or subvoting common stock
if:

o     It is intended for financing purposes with minimal or no dilution to
      current shareholders

o     It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an insider or
      significant shareholder

ISSUE STOCK FOR USE WITH RIGHTS PLAN

Vote AGAINST proposals that increase authorized common stock for the explicit
purpose of implementing a shareholder rights plan (poison pill).

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

Review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis shareholder proposals that seek preemptive
rights. In evaluating proposals on preemptive rights, consider the size of a
company, the characteristics of its shareholder base, and the liquidity of the
stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred
shares after analyzing the number of preferred shares available for issue given
a company's industry and performance in terms of shareholder returns.

RECAPITALIZATION

Votes CASE-BY-CASE on recapitalizations (reclassifications of securities),
taking into account the following: more simplified capital structure, enhanced
liquidity, fairness of conversion terms, impact on voting power and dividends,
reasons for the reclassification, conflicts of interest, and other alternatives
considered.

REVERSE STOCK SPLITS

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split when the number
of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced.

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split to avoid
delisting.

Votes on proposals to implement a reverse stock split that do not
proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized for issue should be
determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a model developed by ISS.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

Vote FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans in
which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

STOCK DISTRIBUTIONS: SPLITS AND DIVIDENDS

Vote FOR management proposals to increase the common share authorization for a
stock split or share dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares
would not result in an excessive number of shares available for issuance as
determined using a model developed by ISS.

<PAGE>

TRACKING STOCK

Votes on the creation of tracking stock are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis,
weighing the strategic value of the transaction against such factors as: adverse
governance changes, excessive increases in authorized capital stock, unfair
method of distribution, diminution of voting rights, adverse conversion
features, negative impact on stock option plans, and other alternatives such as
spinoff.

8. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Votes with respect to equity-based compensation plans should be determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. Our methodology for reviewing compensation plans primarily
focuses on the transfer of shareholder wealth (the dollar cost of pay plans to
shareholders instead of simply focusing on voting power dilution). Using the
expanded compensation data disclosed under the SEC's rules, ISS will value every
award type. ISS will include in its analyses an estimated dollar cost for the
proposed plan and all continuing plans. This cost, dilution to shareholders'
equity, will also be expressed as a percentage figure for the transfer of
shareholder wealth, and will be considered along with dilution to voting power.
Once ISS determines the estimated cost of the plan, we compare it to a
company-specific dilution cap.

Our model determines a company-specific allowable pool of shareholder wealth
that may be transferred from the company to plan participants, adjusted for:

o     Long-term corporate performance (on an absolute basis and relative to a
      standard industry peer group and an appropriate market index),

o     Cash compensation, and

o     Categorization of the company as emerging, growth, or mature.

These adjustments are pegged to market capitalization.

Vote AGAINST plans that expressly permit the repricing of underwater stock
options without shareholder approval.

Generally vote AGAINST plans in which (1) there is a disconnect between the
CEO's pay and company performance (an increase in pay and a decrease in
performance) and the main source of the pay increase (over half) is equity-based
and (2) the CEO is the participant of the equity proposal. A decrease in
performance is based on negative one- and three-year total shareholder returns.
An increase in pay is based on the CEO's total direct compensation (salary, cash
bonus, present value of stock options, face value of restricted stock, face
value of long-term incentive plan payouts, and all other compensation)
increasing over the previous year. Also may WITHHOLD votes from the Compensation
Committee members.

Generally vote AGAINST plans if the company's most recent three-year burn rate
exceeds one standard deviation in excess of the industry mean and is over two
percent of common shares outstanding. See Table 1 for details.

</TABLE>

A company with high three-year average burn rates may avoid triggering the burn
rate policy by committing to the industry average over the next years.

However, the above general voting guidelines for pay for performance may change
if the compensation committee members can demonstrate that they have improved
committee performance based on additional public filing such as an DEFA 14A or
8K. The additional filing needs to present strong and compelling evidence of
improved performance with new information that has not been disclosed in the
original proxy statement. The reiteration of the compensation committee report
will not be sufficient evidence of improved committee performance.

Evidence of improved compensation committee performance includes all of the
following:

o     The compensation committee has reviewed all components of the CEO's
      compensation, including the following:

- -     Base salary, bonus, long-term incentives

- -     Accumulative realized and unrealized stock option and restricted stock
      gains

- -     Dollar value of perquisites and other personal benefits to the CEO and the
      cost to the company

- -     Earnings and accumulated payment obligations under the company's
      nonqualified deferred compensation program

- -     Actual projected payment obligations under the company's supplemental
      executive retirement plan (SERPs)

A tally sheet setting forth all the above components was prepared and reviewed
affixing dollar amounts under the various payout scenarios.

o     A tally sheet with all the above components should be disclosed for the
      following termination scenarios:

- -     Payment if termination occurs within 12 months: $_____

- -     Payment if "not for cause" termination occurs within 12 months: $_____

- -     Payment if "change of control" termination occurs within 12 months: $_____

o     The compensation committee is committed to provide additional information
      on the named executives' annual cash bonus program and/or long-term
      incentive cash plan for the current fiscal year. The compensation
      committee will provide full disclosure of the qualitative and quantitative
      performance criteria and hurdle rates used to determine the payouts of the
      cash program. From this disclosure, shareholders will know the minimum
      level of performance required for any cash bonus to be delivered as well
      as the maximum cash bonus payable for superior performance.

<PAGE>

The repetition of the compensation committee report does not meet ISS'
requirement of compelling and strong evidence of improved disclosure. The level
of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where shareholders can
understand the mechanics of the annual cash bonus and/or long-term incentive
cash plan based on the additional disclosure.

o     The compensation committee is committed to grant a substantial portion of
      performance-based equity awards to the named executive officers. A
      substantial portion of performance-based awards would be at least 50
      percent of the shares awarded to each of the named executive officers.
      Performance-based equity awards are earned or paid out based on the
      achievement of company performance targets. The company will disclose the
      details of the performance criteria (e.g., return on equity) and the
      hurdle rates (e.g., 15 percent) associated with the performance targets.
      From this disclosure, shareholders will know the minimum level of
      performance required for any equity grants to be made. The
      performance-based equity awards do not refer to non-qualified stock
      options(1) or performance-accelerated grants(2). Instead,
      performance-based equity awards are performancecontingent grants where the
      individual will not receive the equity grant by not meeting the target
      performance and vice versa.

The level of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where
shareholders can understand the mechanics of the performance-based equity awards
based on the additional disclosure.

o     The compensation committee has the sole authority to hire and fire outside
      compensation consultants. The role of the outside compensation consultant
      is to assist the compensation committee to analyze executive pay packages
      or contracts and understand the company's financial measures.

BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE OF IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE, ISS WILL GENERALLY VOTE FOR THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS UP FOR
ANNUAL ELECTION AND VOTE FOR THE EMPLOYEE-BASED STOCK PLAN IF THERE IS ONE ON
THE BALLOT. HOWEVER, ISS IS NOT LIKELY TO VOTE FOR THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
MEMBERS AND/OR THE EMPLOYEE-BASED STOCK PLAN IF ISS BELIEVES THE COMPANY HAS NOT
PROVIDED COMPELLING AND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF TRANSPARENT ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE
OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BASED ON THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Votes on compensation plans for directors are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, using a proprietary, quantitative model developed by ISS.

On occasion, director stock plans that set aside a relatively small of shares
when combined with employee or executive stock compensation plans exceed the
allowable cap. In such cases, starting proxy season 2005, ISS will supplement
the analytical approach with a qualitative review of board compensation for
companies, taking into consideration:

o     Director stock ownership guidelines

- -     A minimum of three times the annual cash retainer.

o     Vesting schedule or mandatory holding/deferral period

- -     A minimum vesting of three years for stock options or restricted stock, or

- -     Deferred stock payable at the end of a three-year deferral period.

o     Mix between cash and equity

- -     A balanced mix of cash and equity, for example 40% cash/60% equity or 50%
      cash/50% equity.

- -     If the mix is heavier on the equity component, the vesting schedule or
      deferral period should be more stringent, with the lesser of five years or
      the term of directorship.

- ----------
(1)   Non-qualified stock options are not performance-based awards unless the
      grant or the vesting of the stock options is tied to the achievement of a
      pre-determined and disclosed performance measure. A rising stock market
      will generally increase share prices of all companies, despite of the
      company's underlying performance.

(2)   Performance-accelerated grants are awards that vest earlier based on the
      achievement of a specified measure. However, these grants will ultimately
      vest over time even without the attainment of the goal(s).

<PAGE>

o     Retirement/Benefit and Perquisites programs

- -     No retirement/benefits and perquisites provided to non-employee directors.

o     Quality of disclosure

- -     Provide detailed disclosure on cash and equity compensation delivered to
      each non-employee director for the most recent fiscal year in a table. The
      column headers for the table may include the following: name of each
      non-employee director, annual retainer, board meeting fees, committee
      retainer, committee-meeting fees, and equity grants.

For ISS to recommend a vote FOR director equity plans based on the above
qualitative features, a company needs to demonstrate that it meets all the above
qualitative features in its proxy statement.

STOCK PLANS IN LIEU OF CASH

Votes for plans which provide participants with the option of taking all or a
portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock are determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

Vote FOR plans which provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

Votes for plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange
should be determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a proprietary, quantitative
model developed by ISS. In cases where the exchange is not dollar-for-dollar,
the request for new or additional shares for such equity program will be
considered in the quantitative model. However, the cost would be lower than
full-value awards since part of the deferral compensation is in-lieu-of cash
compensation.

DIRECTOR RETIREMENT PLANS

Vote AGAINST retirement plans for nonemployee directors.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to eliminate retirement plans for nonemployee
directors.

MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS SEEKING APPROVAL TO REPRICE OPTIONS

Votes on management proposals seeking approval to reprice options are evaluated
on a CASE-BY-CASE basis giving consideration to the following:

o     Historic trading patterns

o     Rationale for the repricing

o     Value-for-value exchange

o     Treatment of surrendered options

o     Option vesting

o     Term of the option

o     Exercise price

o     Participation.

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

Votes on qualified employee stock purchase plans should be determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

Vote FOR employee stock purchase plans where all of the following apply:

o     Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value

o     Offering period is 27 months or less, and

o     The number of shares allocated to the plan is ten percent or less of the
      outstanding shares

Vote AGAINST qualified employee stock purchase plans where any of the following
apply:

o     Purchase price is less than 85 percent of fair market value, or

o     Offering period is greater than 27 months, or

o     The number of shares allocated to the plan is more than ten percent of the
      outstanding shares

NONQUALIFIED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

Votes on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans should be determined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

Vote FOR nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following
features:

<PAGE>

o     Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with the
      exclusion of individuals with 5 percent or more of beneficial ownership of
      the company).

o     Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount or
      expressed as a percent of base salary.

o     Company matching contribution up to 25 percent of employee's contribution,
      which is effectively a discount of 20 percent from market value.

o     No discount on the stock price on the date of purchase since there is a
      company matching contribution.

Vote AGAINST nonqualified employee stock purchase plans when any of the plan
features do not meet the above criteria.

INCENTIVE BONUS PLANS AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSALS (OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION
PROPOSALS)

Vote FOR proposals that simply amend shareholder-approved compensation plans to
include administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one
participant may receive to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m).

Vote FOR proposals to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) unless they are clearly
inappropriate.

Votes to amend existing plans to increase shares reserved and to qualify for
favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section 162(m) should be
considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis using a proprietary, quantitative model
developed by ISS.

Generally vote FOR cash or cash and stock bonus plans that are submitted to
shareholders for the purpose of exempting compensation from taxes under the
provisions of Section 162(m) if no increase in shares is requested.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)

Vote FOR proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized shares for
existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive
(more than five percent of outstanding shares.)

401(K) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS REGARDING EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director pay information, provided the information requested is
relevant to shareholders' needs, would not put the company at a competitive
disadvantage relative to its industry, and is not unduly burdensome to the
company.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on
compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring director fees be paid in stock
only.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for all other shareholder proposals regarding
executive and director pay, taking into account company performance, pay level
versus peers, pay level versus industry, and long term corporate outlook.

OPTION EXPENSING

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals asking the company to expense stock
options, unless the company has already publicly committed to expensing options
by a specific date.

<PAGE>

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based
awards like indexed, premium-priced, and performance-vested options or
performance-based shares, unless:

o     The proposal is overly restrictive (e.g., it mandates that awards to all
      employees must be performance-based or all awards to top executives must
      be a particular type, such as indexed options)

o     The company demonstrates that it is using a substantial portion of
      performance-based awards for its top executives

GOLDEN PARACHUTES AND EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to require golden parachutes or executive
severance agreements to be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the
proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment
contracts.

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis on proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes.
An acceptable parachute should include the following:

o     The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management

o     The amount should not exceed three times base amount (defined as the
      average annual taxable W-2 compensation during the five years prior to the
      year in which the change of control occurs

o     Change-in-control payments should be double-triggered, i.e., (1) after a
      change in control has taken place, and (2) termination of the executive as
      a result of the change in control. ISS defines change in control as a
      change in the company ownership structure.

PENSION PLAN INCOME ACCOUNTING

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals to exclude pension plan income in the
calculation of earnings used in determining executive bonuses/compensation.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS (SERPS)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary
benefits contained in SERP agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company's
executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered
under employee-wide plans.

9. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

CONSUMER ISSUES AND PUBLIC SAFETY

ANIMAL RIGHTS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to phase out the use of animals in product
testing, taking into account:

o     The nature of the product and the degree that animal testing is necessary
      or federally mandated (such as medical products),

o     The availability and feasibility of alternatives to animal testing to
      ensure product safety, and

o     The degree that competitors are using animal-free testing.

o     Generally vote FOR proposals seeking a report on the company's animal
      welfare standards unless:

o     The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and
      monitors compliance

o     The company's standards are comparable to or better than those of peer
      firms, and

o     There are no serious controversies surrounding the company's treatment of
      animals

DRUG PRICING

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking the company to implement price restraints
on pharmaceutical products, taking into account:

o     Whether the proposal focuses on a specific drug and region

<PAGE>

o     Whether the economic benefits of providing subsidized drugs (e.g., public
      goodwill) outweigh the costs in terms of reduced profits, lower R&D
      spending, and harm to competitiveness

o     The extent that reduced prices can be offset through the company's
      marketing budget without affecting R&D spending

o     Whether the company already limits price increases of its products

o     Whether the company already contributes life -saving pharmaceuticals to
      the needy and Third World countries

o     The extent that peer companies implement price restraints

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

Vote AGAINST proposals asking companies to voluntarily label genetically
engineered (GE) ingredients in their products or alternatively to provide
interim labeling and eventually eliminate GE ingredients due to the costs and
feasibility of labeling and/or phasing out the use of GE ingredients.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for a report on the feasibility of
labeling products containing GE ingredients taking into account:

o     The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and the
      proportion of it affected by the resolution

o     The quality of the company's disclosure on GE product labeling and related
      voluntary initiatives and how this disclosure compares with peer company
      disclosure

o     Company's current disclosure on the feasibility of GE product labeling,
      including information on the related costs

o     Any voluntary labeling initiatives undertaken or considered by the
      company.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for the preparation of a report on the
financial, legal, and environmental impact of continued use of GE
ingredients/seeds.

o     The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and the
      proportion of it affected by the resolution

o     The quality of the company's disclosure on risks related to GE product use
      and how this disclosure compares with peer company disclosure

o     The percentage of revenue derived from international operations,
      particularly in Europe, where GE products are more regulated and consumer
      backlash is more pronounced.

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking a report on the health and environmental effects
of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Health studies of this sort are better
undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the company's
products or proposals asking for reports outlining the steps necessary to
eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to federal regulators) that outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.

HANDGUNS

Generally vote AGAINST requests for reports on a company's policies aimed at
curtailing gun violence in the United States unless the report is confined to
product safety information. Criminal misuse of firearms is beyond company
control and instead falls within the purview of law enforcement agencies.

HIV/AIDS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on requests for reports outlining the impact of the health
pandemic (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) on the company's Sub-Saharan
operations and how the company is responding to it, taking into account:

o     The nature and size of the company's operations in Sub-Saharan Africa and
      the number of local employees

o     The company's existing healthcare policies, including benefits and
      healthcare access for local workers

o     Company donations to healthcare providers operating in the region

Vote AGAINST proposals asking companies to establish, implement, and report on a
standard of response to the HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria health pandemic in Africa
and other developing countries, unless the company has significant operations in
these markets and has failed to adopt policies and/or procedures to address
these issues comparable to those of industry peers.

<PAGE>

PREDATORY LENDING

Vote CASE-BY CASE on requests for reports on the company's procedures for
preventing predatory lending, including the establishment of a board committee
for oversight, taking into account:

o     Whether the company has adequately disclosed mechanisms in place to
      prevent abusive lending practices

o     Whether the company has adequately disclosed the financial risks of its
      subprime business

o     Whether the company has been subject to violations of lending laws or
      serious lending controversies

o     Peer companies' policies to prevent abusive lending practices.

TOBACCO

Most tobacco-related proposals should be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis,
taking into account the following factors:

Second-hand smoke:

o     Whether the company complies with all local ordinances and regulations

o     The degree that voluntary restrictions beyond those mandated by law might
      hurt the company's competitiveness

o     The risk of any health-related liabilities. Advertising to youth:

o     Whether the company complies with federal, state, and local laws on the
      marketing of tobacco or if it has been fined for violations

o     Whether the company has gone as far as p eers in restricting advertising

o     Whether the company entered into the Master Settlement Agreement, which
      restricts marketing of tobacco to youth

o     Whether restrictions on marketing to youth extend to foreign countries

Cease production of tobacco-related products or avoid selling products to
tobacco companies:

o     The percentage of the company's business affected

o     The economic loss of eliminating the business versus any potential
      tobacco-related liabilities.

o     Spinoff tobacco-related businesses:

o     The percentage of the company's business affected

o     The feasibility of a spinoff

o     Potential future liabilities related to the company's tobacco business.

Stronger product warnings:

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking stronger product warnings. Such decisions are
better left to public health authorities.

Investment in tobacco stocks:

Vote AGAINST proposals prohibiting investment in tobacco equities. Such
decisions are better left to portfolio managers.

ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY

ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE

Generally vote AGAINST request for reports outlining potential environmental
damage from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) unless:

o     New legislation is adopted allowing development and drilling in the ANWR
      region;

o     The company intends to pursue operations in the ANWR; and

o     The company does not currently disclose an environmental risk report for
      their operations in the ANWR.

<PAGE>

CERES PRINCIPLES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt the CERES Principles, taking into
account:

o     The company's current environmental disclosure beyond legal requirements,
      including environmental health and safety (EHS) audits and reports that
      may duplicate CERES

o     The company's environmental performance record, including violations of
      federal and state regulations, level of toxic emissions, and accidental
      spills

o     Environmentally conscious practices of peer companies, including
      endorsement of CERES

o     Costs of membership and implementation.

ENVIRONMENTAL-ECONOMIC RISK REPORT

Vote CASE BY CASE on proposals requesting an economic risk assessment of
environmental performance considering:

o     The feasibility of financially quantifying environmental risk factors,

o     The company's compliance with applicable legislation and/or regulations
      regarding environmental performance,

o     The costs associated with implementing improved standards,

o     The potential costs associated with remediation resulting from poor
      environmental performance, and

o     The current level of disclosure on environmental policies and initiatives.

ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS

Generally vote FOR requests for reports disclosing the company's environmental
policies unless it already has well-documented environmental management systems
that are available to the public.

GLOBAL WARMING

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting a report on greenhouse gas emissions
from company operations and/or products unless this information is already
publicly disclosed or such factors are not integral to the company's line of
business.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals that call for reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by specified amounts or within a restrictive time frame unless the
company lags industry standards and has been the subject of recent, significant
fines or litigation resulting from greenhouse gas emissions.

RECYCLING

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt a comprehensive recycling strategy,
taking into account:

o     The nature of the company's business and the percentage affected

o     The extent that peer companies are recycling

o     The timetable prescribed by the proposal

o     The costs and methods of implementation

o     Whether the company has a poor environmental track record, such as
      violations of federal and state regulations.

RENEWABLE ENERGY

In general, vote FOR requests for reports on the feasibility of developing
renewable energy sources unless the report is duplicative of existing disclosure
or irrelevant to the company's line of business.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that the company invest in renewable
energy sources. Such decisions are best left to management's evaluation of the
feasibility and financial impact that such programs may have on the company.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on policies and
initiatives related to social, economic, and environmental sustainability,
unless:

<PAGE>

      o     The company already discloses similar information through existing
            reports or policies such as an Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS)
            report; comprehensive Code of Corporate Conduct; and/or Diversity
            Report; or

      o     The company has formally committed to the implementation of a
            reporting program based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
            guidelines or a similar standard within a specified time frame.

GENERAL CORPORATE ISSUES

OUTSOURCING/ OFFSHORING

Vote CASE BY CASE on proposals calling for companies to report on the risks
associated with outsourcing, considering:

      o     Risks associated with certain international markets

      o     The utility of such a report to shareholders

      o     The existence of a publicly available code of corporate conduct that
            applies to international operations

LINK EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO SOCIAL PERFORMANCE

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to review ways of linking executive compensation
to social factors, such as corporate downsizings, customer or employee
satisfaction, community involvement, human rights, environmental performance,
predatory lending, and executive/employee pay disparities. Such resolutions
should be evaluated in the context of:

o     The relevance of the issue to be linked to pay

o     The degree that social performance is already included in the company's
      pay structure and disclosed

o     The degree that social performance is used by peer companies in setting
      pay

o     Violations or complaints filed against the company relating to the
      particular social performance measure

o     Artificial limits sought by the proposal, such as freezing or capping
      executive pay

o     Independence of the compensation committee

o     Current company pay levels.

CHARITABLE/POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking the company to affirm political
nonpartisanship in the workplace so long as:

o     The company is in compliance with laws governing corporate political
      activities, and

o     The company has procedures in place to ensure that employee contributions
      to company-sponsored political action committees (PACs) are strictly
      voluntary and not coercive.

Vote AGAINST proposals to report or publish in newspapers the company's
political contributions. Federal and state laws restrict the amount of corporate
contributions and include reporting requirements.

Vote AGAINST proposals disallowing the company from making political
contributions. Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and
local level and barring contributions can put the company at a competitive
disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals restricting the company from making charitable
contributions. Charitable contributions are generally useful for assisting
worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill in the community. In the absence of
bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management should determine which
contributions are in the best interests of the company.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have prior
government service and whether such service had a bearing on the business of the
company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without providing any
meaningful information to shareholders.

      global standards and the degree they meet the standards promulgated by the
      proponent

o     Agreements with foreign suppliers to meet certain workplace standards

o     Whether company and vendor facilities are monitored and how

o     Company participation in fair labor organizations

o     Type of business

o     Proportion of business conducted overseas

o     Countries of operation with known human rights abuses

o     Whether the company has been recently involved in significant labor and
      human rights controversies or violations

o     Peer company standards and practices

o     Union presence in company's international factories

o     Generally vote FOR reports outlining vendor standards compliance unless
      any of the following apply:

o     The company does not operate in countries with significant human rights
      violations

o     The company has no recent human rights controversies or violations, or

o     The company already publicly discloses information on its vendor standards
      compliance.

MACBRIDE PRINCIPLES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to endorse or increase activity on the MacBride
Principles, taking into account:

o     Company compliance with or violations of the Fair Employment Act of 1989

o     Company antidiscrimination policies that already exceed the legal
      requirements

o     The cost and feasibility of adopting all nine principles

o     The cost of duplicating efforts to follow two sets of standards (Fair
      Employment and the MacBride Principles)

<PAGE>

o     The potential for charges of reverse discrimination

o     The potential that any company sales or contracts in the rest of the
      United Kingdom could be negatively impacted

o     The level of the company's investment in Northern Ireland

o     The number of company employees in Northern Ireland

o     The degree that industry peers have adopted the MacBride Principles

o     Applicable state and municipal laws that limit contracts with companies
      that have not adopted the MacBride Principles.

MILITARY BUSINESS

FOREIGN MILITARY SALES/OFFSETS

Vote AGAINST reports on foreign military sales or offsets. Such disclosures may
involve sensitive and confidential information. Moreover, companies must comply
with government controls and reporting on foreign military sales.

LANDMINES AND CLUSTER BOMBS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking a company to renounce future involvement
in antipersonnel landmine production, taking into account:

o     Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking a company to renounce future
      involvement in cluster bomb production, taking into account:

      bombs or their components

o     Whether the company's peers have renounced future production

NUCLEAR WEAPONS

Vote AGAINST proposals asking a company to cease production of nuclear weapons
components and delivery systems, including disengaging from current and proposed
contracts. Components and delivery systems serve multiple military and
non-military uses, and withdrawal from these contracts could have a negative
impact on the company's business.

OPERATIONS IN NATIONS SPONSORING TERRORISM (IRAN)

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on requests for a board committee review and report outlining
the company's financial and reputational risks from its operations in Iran,
taking into account current disclosure on:

o     The nature and purpose of the Iranian operations and the amount of
      business involved (direct and indirect revenues and expenses) that could
      be affected by political disruption

o     Compliance with U.S. sanctions and laws

SPACED-BASED WEAPONIZATION

Generally vote FOR reports on a company's involvement in spaced-based

o     The disclosures sought could compromise proprietary information.

<PAGE>

unless:

o     The board composition is reasonably inclusive in relation to companies of
      similar size and business or

o     The board already reports on its nominating procedures and diversity
      initiatives.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals that would call for the adoption of specific
committee charter language regarding diversity initiatives unless the company

      initiatives and provides data on its workforce diversity, and

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION.

         This code of  conduct  is being  adopted  by the  investment  companies
advised by First Trust Advisors,  L.P., set forth in Appendix A, as amended from
time to time,  (the  "FUNDS").  The  reputation  and  integrity of the Funds are
valuable assets that are vital to the Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds,
and officers and  employees of the  investment  adviser to the Funds who work on
Fund matters,  including each of the Funds' senior financial  officers ("SFOS"),
is responsible for conducting each Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates
a commitment to the highest  standards of integrity.  SFOs include the Principal
Executive  Officer (who is the President),  the Controller (who is the principal
accounting officer), and the Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer),
and any person who performs a similar function.

         The Funds,  First Trust Advisors,  L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted  Codes of Ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940 (the "RULE  17J-1  CODE").  These  Codes of Ethics are  designed to prevent
certain  conflicts  of  interest  that may arise when  officers,  employees,  or
directors of the Funds and the  foregoing  entities know about present or future
Fund  transactions  and/or have the power to influence those  transactions,  and
engage in  transactions  with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise  take  advantage of their  position and  knowledge  with
respect to those  securities.  In an effort to prevent  these  conflicts  and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1,  the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions  and conduct that create  conflicts  of interest,  and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  designed  to  address  corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely  disclosing financial  information.  Under Section
406 of the Act, all public  companies  (including  the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent  future  situations  (such as  occurred in  well-reported  situations
involving  such  companies  as Enron and  WorldCom)  where a company  creates an
environment  in which  employees  are afraid to  express  their  opinions  or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds  have  chosen  to adopt a senior  financial  officer  Code of
Conduct to encourage  their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust  Advisors  or First Trust  Portfolios,  to act  ethically  and to question
potentially  unethical  or illegal  practices,  and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.

<PAGE>

II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT.

         The purposes of this Code are:

         A.     To promote  honest and ethical  conduct,  including  the ethical
                handling of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of interest  between
                personal and professional relationships;

         B.     To promote full,  fair,  accurate,  timely,  and  understandable
                disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file with, or
                submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the Funds
                make;

         C.     To promote  compliance with applicable  governmental laws, rules
                and regulations;

         D.     To encourage  the prompt  internal  reporting to an  appropriate
                person of violations of the Code; and

         E.     To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE.

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated Mitchell E. Mohr or other
appropriate  officer  designated by the President of the respective  Funds to be
the Compliance  Coordinator for the  implementation  and  administration  of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         The Funds have adopted  guidelines  under which its SFOs perform  their
duties.  However, the Funds expect that ALL officers or employees of the adviser
or  distributor  who  participate  in the  preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

         A.     Act with  honesty and  integrity  and avoid  violations  of this
                Code,  including  actual or apparent  conflicts of interest with
                the Fund in personal and professional relationships.

         B.     Disclose  to the  Fund's  Compliance  Coordinator  any  material
                transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to
                give rise to any  violations  of the Code,  including  actual or
                apparent  conflicts  of  interest  with  the  Fund.  You  should
                disclose these  transactions  or  relationships  whether you are
                involved or have only observed the transaction or  relationship.
                If it is not possible to disclose  the matter to the  Compliance
                Coordinator,  it should be  disclosed  to the  Fund's  Principal
                Financial Officer or Principal Executive Officer.

         C.     Provide information to the Fund's other officers and appropriate
                employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,  outside
                auditor,  outside  counsel,

                                      -2-

                custodian,   etc.)   that   is  accurate,  complete,  objective,
                relevant, timely, and understandable.

         D.     Endeavor  to  ensure   full,   fair,   timely,   accurate,   and
                understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

         E.     Comply with the  federal  securities  laws and other  applicable
                laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

         F.     Act in good faith,  responsibly,  and with due care,  competence
                and  diligence,   without  misrepresenting   material  facts  or
                allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

         G.     Respect  the  confidentiality  of  information  acquired  in the
                course  of your  work  except  when you have  Fund  approval  to
                disclose it or where disclosure is otherwise  legally  mandated.
                You may not use confidential  information acquired in the course
                of your work for personal advantage.

         H.     Share and maintain  skills  important and relevant to the Fund's
                needs.

         I.     Proactively  promote  ethical  behavior among peers in your work
                environment.

         J.     Responsibly use and control all assets and resources employed or
                entrusted to you.

         K.     Record or  participate in the recording of entries in the Fund's
                books  and  records  that  are  accurate  to the  best  of  your
                knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE.

         SFOs and other  parties  subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain  provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting   their  request  in  writing  to  the  Compliance   Coordinator  for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's  shareholders  to the  extent  required  by SEC  rules.  A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code,  however,  shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual  basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.     REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS.

         A.     SFOs or other  officers of the Funds or  employees  of the First
                Trust group who work on Fund matters who observe,  learn of, or,
                in good faith,  suspect a violation of the

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

                Code MUST immediately report the  violation  to  the  Compliance
                Coordinator,  another  member  of  the  Funds'  or First Trust's
                senior  management, or to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board.
                An example of a possible Code  violation is the preparation  and
                filing  of  financial disclosure that omits material  facts,  or
                that  is  accurate  but  is  written  in a way that obscures its
                meaning.

         B.     Because  service  providers  such as an  administrator,  outside
                accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating
                to the  Funds'  financial  statements,  you  should be alert for
                actions by service providers that may be illegal,  or that could
                be viewed as dishonest or unethical  conduct.  You should report
                these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
                think,  that the service provider has its own code of ethics for
                its SFOs or employees.

         C.     SFOs or other  officers or employees  who report  violations  or
                suspected  violations  in good  faith  will  not be  subject  to
                retaliation   of  any   kind.   Reported   violations   will  be
                investigated   and  addressed   promptly  and  will  be  treated
                confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.    VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

         A.     Dishonest,  unethical  or  illegal  conduct  will  constitute  a
                violation   of  this  Code,  regardless  of  whether  this  Code
                specifically  refers to that  particular conduct. A violation of
                this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
                termination of employment.  A variety of laws apply to the Funds
                and  their  operations,  including the  Securities  Act of 1933,
                the  Investment Company Act  of 1940,  state  laws  relating  to
                duties  owed by Fund  directors and officers, and criminal laws.
                The federal  securities laws  generally  prohibit the Funds from
                making  material  misstatements  in  its  prospectus  and  other
                documents filed with  the  SEC,  or  from  omitting  to  state a
                material   fact.  These  material  misstatements  and  omissions
                include  financial  statements  that  are  misleading  or   omit
                materials facts.

         B.     Examples  of criminal violations of the  law  include  stealing,
                embezzling,  misapplying  corporate  or  bank  funds,  making  a
                payment  for  an  expressed  purpose  on  a Fund's  behalf to an
                individual  who intends to use it for  a  different purpose;  or
                making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash or other
                items of value that are  intended to  influence  the judgment or
                actions  of  political  candidates,  government   officials   or
                businesses  in  connection  with  any of the Funds'  activities.
                The Funds must and will report all suspected criminal violations
                to the  appropriate  authorities for possible  prosecution,  and
                will  investigate,   address   and   report,   as   appropriate,
                non-criminal violations.

              generally accepted accounting principles;

              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
