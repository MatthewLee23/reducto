DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We present you with the annual report for Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER WILLIAM VERONDA

Q.   HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM DURING THE PERIOD RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS?

A.   For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, the Fund's net asset value
advanced 10.45%, while its market price increased 10.61%, underperforming its
competitors as measured by the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged)
Median. For comparison purposes, the Lipper Median's net asset value and market
price grew 12.69% and 14.19%, respectively. The Fund lagged its benchmark
primarily due to its shorter average duration compared to its peers. (For more
performance information, please refer to "Performance At A Glance" on page 5).

Q.   CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE PERIOD?

A.   The economy didn't move in any clear direction over the period. Initially,
it appeared to be on the path to recovery. Newly reported gross domestic product
(GDP) for the first quarter of 2002 came in at a strong 5.0%. Second quarter GDP
told a very different story, however, as ongoing threats of terrorism, turmoil
in the Middle East, falling corporate spending, a weak stock market, and
corporate accounting scandals took their toll. The final figure came in at a
tepid 1.3%. Although the news improved somewhat during the third quarter--GDP
rose to 4.0%--hopes for economic recovery dimmed when fourth quarter GDP came in
at 1.4%.

By the time the review period wound down in March, little about this economic
picture had changed. Fears concerning a potential war with Iraq were replaced by
fears over the longevity and cost of the war after it began. It was also clear
that other factors, including the heightened threat of terrorism and
saber-rattling in North Korea, continued to weigh heavily on the forces driving
economic growth. This was ultimately reflected in the advance GDP figure for
first quarter 2003, which came in at 1.6%.

Q.   HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THE WEAKENING
ECONOMY?

A.   In November 2002, the Fed acknowledged that the economy appeared to have
hit a "soft spot." Thus, after holding interest rates steady during the first
ten months of 2002, the Fed, at its November meeting, moved to lower the federal
funds rate one half of a percentage point to 1.25%--a 41-year low. Since that
time, the Fed has held rates steady--most recently at its May 6, 2003 meeting.

Q.   HOW DID THE BOND MARKET PERFORM DURING THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD?

A.   The bond market performed well, although there were periods of volatility
due to uncertainty engendered by the economy and the situation in Iraq. Looking
at the period as a whole, yields fell and prices rose as investors were drawn to
the relative safety offered by fixed income securities, including municipal
bonds.

Q.   DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTEREST RATES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DECLINED.
HAS THIS AFFECTED THE FUND?

A.   Yes, it has. A number of issuers have chosen to call, or buy back, their
bonds before their stated maturity dates. By doing so, the issuers can then
issue new securities at today's lower rates, and thus cut their borrowing costs.
We are using the proceeds we receive from these involuntary sales to purchase
bonds offering lower coupons. Because of this trend, however, we are taking
special care to thoroughly investigate any call provisions in the bonds we are
considering for the Fund.

Q.   WHILE THE FUND GENERATED STRONG ABSOLUTE RETURNS, IT LAGGED ITS BENCHMARK
DURING THE PERIOD. WHAT WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS?

A.   As we explained in our last report to shareholders, the Fund's performance
has been affected by our attempt to minimize the realization of capital gains.
This has become increasingly difficult to do, because nearly every security in
the portfolio has appreciated due to the strong performance of the municipal
market. One way to avoid capital gains is to hold on to positions in the
portfolio. However, in doing so, many of the securities in the Fund's portfolio
have "aged" to the point where they have short maturities. Given the falling
interest rate environment, the Fund's shorter duration caused it to underperform
its peers.

Another result of our focus on avoiding the realization of capital gains is that
it limits our flexibility to invest in longer-term securities that offer
compelling yield and quality characteristics. Therefore, during the period we
worked to prudently eliminate certain holdings with shorter durations in an
effort to extend the Fund's duration and enhance its portfolio. One example was
our sale of Louisville & Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District Sewer &
Drain System bonds

================================================================================

that mature in 2004. This security offered a low yield and modest capital gain,
making it an appropriate candidate to eliminate from the portfolio.

Q.   WHEN PURCHASING NEW BONDS FOR THE PORTFOLIO, ARE YOU TARGETING A SPECIFIC
DURATION RANGE AND YIELD?

A.   Yes, we are targeting bonds with approximately a 10-year call and a
maturity in the 15- to 20-year range. We believe these issues allow us to
maximize yield relative to market volatility. Additionally, we're looking for
bonds that offer a yield premium of 50 to 100 basis points versus what is
currently available in the marketplace (a basis point is 1/100 of a percentage
point).

It is also important to point out that we're diversifying the portfolio by
investing a portion of the portfolio in AAA-rated uninsured bonds. By
prospectus, we can invest up to 20% of the Fund's portfolio in these issues.
U.S. government securities back many of the uninsured securities we're holding
in the portfolio, and we believe they offer superior quality versus certain
insured bonds.

Q.   CAN YOU SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SECTORS YOU'RE EMPHASIZING AND SPECIFIC
SECURITIES YOU ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO DURING THE PERIOD?

A.   We like the fundamentals offered by essential service revenue bonds,
including revenue-producing utilities, and, in particular, select electric power
revenue bonds. We're seeing a rebound in this area due to a reversal in the
deregulation that led to severe problems in states such as California.

We are also drawn to airport revenue bonds. While the airline industry is
extremely weak, we believe many airport bonds offer compelling opportunities,
since the need for airfreight and transportation is a vital component of our
economy. An example of a holding in this area is St. Louis Airport bonds.

Q.   WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY, AND HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE POSITIONING
THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?

A.   The economy clearly failed to gain any momentum during the period, and we
believe it is likely to expand only modestly in the coming months. In terms of
interest rates, the outlook remains cloudy at best, due to the uncertainties
surrounding the impact of the war in Iraq and its effect on economic growth.

On a strategy level, the mounting state budget deficits have drawn our
attention. Numerous states have seen their budget surpluses dry up and become
substantial deficits. In fact, over 90% of the states are now experiencing
shortfalls, with a record $80 billion nationwide deficit projected for fiscal
year 2004 (which begins on July 1, 2003). In many cases, states have been
reluctant to make the necessary spending cuts or to implement tax increases
necessary to bring their budgets in line. Because of this, we will continue to
avoid state credits that do not meet our stringent quality requirements. Rather,
we intend to focus on

   Past performance does not predict future performance. The return and
   principal value of an investment will fluctuate, so that an investor's
   shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. NAV
   return assumes, for illustration only, that dividends were reinvested at the

   do not include brokerage commissions or taxes paid on realized capital gains.

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements


ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured  Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended,  as  a  closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a high level of current  income that is exempt from federal  income tax,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States requires the Fund's  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF  INVESTMENTS--The  Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available,  for its portfolio  securities.  The Fund
normally  obtains  market values for its  securities  from  independent  pricing
sources and  broker-dealers.  Independent  pricing sources may use reported last
sale prices,  current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities.  If a market value is
not available from an independent pricing source for a particular security, that
security  is valued at fair  value as  determined  in good faith by or under the
direction of the Fund's Board of Directors  (the  "Board").  The amortized  cost
method of valuation, which approximates market value, generally is used to value
short-term  debt  instruments  with sixty days or less  remaining  to  maturity,
unless the Board determines that this does not represent fair value.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND  INVESTMENT  INCOME--Investment  transactions  are
recorded  on  the  trade  date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual basis.  Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders  at a level rate that over time will result in the  distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding  auction  preferred  shares.  The dividend rate on the common
stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the performance of the Fund. Dividends
and  distributions to common  shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Dividends to auction  preferred  shareholders  are accrued daily.  The amount of
dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital
gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may
differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These
"book/tax"  differences are either considered  temporary or permanent in nature.
To the extent  these  differences  are  permanent  in nature,  such  amounts are
reclassified  within  the  capital

accounts based on their federal tax-basis  treatment;  temporary  differences do
not require reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund  follows an  investment  policy of  investing  primarily  in  municipal
obligations  of various  states.  Economic  changes  affecting  those states and
certain of their public bodies and  municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has  approved  an  investment  advisory  and  administration  contract
("Advisory  Contract")  with UBS Global Asset  Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM") under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator of
the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management  subsidiary
of UBS AG, an  internationally  diversified  organization  with  headquarters in
Zurich,  Switzerland  and  operations  in many areas of the  financial  services
industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract,  the Fund pays UBS Global AM
an investment  advisory and administration fee, which is accrued weekly and paid
monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's average weekly net assets. At
March 31, 2003, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $313,848,  representing $364,468 for
investment advisory and administration fees less fee waivers of $50,620. For the
year  ended  March 31,  2003,  UBS  Global AM  voluntarily  waived  $590,524  in
investment advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

COMMON STOCK

There are  199,997,000  shares of $0.001 par value common stock  authorized  and
20,628,363 common shares outstanding at March 31, 2003.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of Auction  Preferred Shares Series A, 800 shares
of Auction  Preferred  Shares Series B, 800 shares of Auction  Preferred  Shares
Series C and 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D, which are referred
to herein  collectively  as the "APS."  All shares of each  series of APS have a
liquidation  preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to accumulated
but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for APS Series
A, 28 days for APS  Series B, 90 days for APS Series C and 7 days for APS Series
D. Dividend  rates ranged from 0.90% to 1.85% for the year ended March 31, 2003.

The Fund is subject  to certain  restrictions  relating  to the APS.  Failure to
comply  with these  restrictions  could  preclude  the Fund from  declaring  any
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

Notes to Financial Statements


The APS are  entitled to one vote per share and,  unless  otherwise  required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single  class,  except that the
auction preferred shares will vote separately as a class on certain matters,  as
required by law. The holders of the auction  preferred  shares have the right to
elect two directors of the Fund.

The redemption of the Fund's auction  preferred shares is outside of the control
of the Fund because it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not
solely within the control of the Fund.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

For federal  income tax  purposes,  at March 31,  2003,  the  components  of net
unrealized appreciation of investments were as follows:

Gross appreciation (from investments having
  an excess value over cost) ....................................  $ 25,002,282
Gross depreciation (from investments having
  an excess of cost over value) .................................    (6,926,195)
                                                                   ------------
Net unrealized appreciation of investments ......................  $ 18,076,087
                                                                   ============

For the year  ended  March 31,  2003,  total  aggregate  purchases  and sales of
portfolio  securities,  excluding short-term  securities,  were $121,668,337 and

The Fund intends to distribute  substantially  all of its tax-exempt  income and
any taxable  income and to comply with the other  requirements  of the  Internal
Revenue Code  applicable  to regulated  investment  companies.  Accordingly,  no
provision for federal  income taxes is required.  In addition,  by  distributing
during  each  calendar  year  substantially  all of its net  investment  income,
realized  capital gains and certain other amounts,  if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions  paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2003 and March 31, 2002 were as follows:

Distributions paid from:                                    2003         2002
                                                        -----------  -----------

Notes to Financial Statements


The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized  appreciation of
investments is  attributable  to the  realization for tax purposes of unrealized
gains/losses on certain securities that were marked-to-market.

To reflect  reclassifications  arising from permanent "book/tax" differences for
the year ended March 31, 2003, the Fund's  undistributed  net investment  income
was  decreased by $73,370 and  accumulated  net realized  loss was  decreased by
$73,370.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.

GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

THE FUND

Insured  Municipal  Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") is a  diversified,  closed-end
management  investment  company whose shares trade on the New YorkStock Exchange
("NYSE").The  Fund's investment  objective is to achieve a high level of current
income that is exempt from federal income tax,  consistent with the preservation
of capital.  The Fund's investment advisor and administrator is UBS Global Asset
Management  (US)  Inc.  ("UBS  Global  AM"),  an  indirect  wholly  owned  asset
management  subsidiary  of UBS AG, which has over $73.0  billion in assets under
management as of April 30, 2003.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "PIF."  Comparative net asset value and market
price information about the Fund is published weekly in THE WALLSTREET  JOURNAL,
THE NEW YORK TIMES and BARRON'S, as well as in numerous other publications.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") under
which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names, or
in the name of UBS PaineWebber Inc. or its nominee,  will have all dividends and
other distributions on their shares of common stock automatically  reinvested in
additional  shares of common  stock,  unless such common  shareholders  elect to
receive  cash.Common  shareholders who elect to hold their shares in the name of
another  broker or nominee  should  contact  such broker or nominee to determine
whether,  or  how,  they  may  participate  in  the  Plan.The  ability  of  such
shareholders  to  participate  in the  Plan  may  change  if  their  shares  are
transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common  shareholder  may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty,  and common  shareholders
who have previously  terminated  participation  in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time.  Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should  include  the  shareholder's  name and  address as they appear on the
share  certificate or in the transfer agent's records.  An election to terminate
participation  in the Plan,  until such  election is changed,  will be deemed an
election by a common  shareholder to take all subsequent  distributions in cash.
An election  will be  effective  only for  distributions  declared  and having a
record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is received.

Additional  shares of common stock  acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than  the net  asset  value  per  share of the  common  stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to

================================================================================

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.


GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (CONCLUDED)

the  result  obtained  by  dividing  the  amount of the  dividend  payable  to a
particular  shareholder  by the average  price per share  (including  applicable
brokerage  commissions)  that the transfer  agent was able to obtain in the open
market.  The Fund will not issue any new  shares of common  stock in  connection
with the Plan.  There  currently is no charge to  participants  for  reinvesting
dividends or other  distributions.  The  transfer  agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment  of  distributions  will  be  paid  by  the  Fund.  However,   each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions.  The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and
other  distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve  participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.  Accordingly,
the Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate  the Plan with respect to any
dividend  or  other  distribution  if  notice  of the  change  is  sent  to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution.  The
Plan also may be  amended or  terminated  by the  transfer  agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants.  Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the  transfer  agent at PFPC Inc.,  P.O. Box 43027,  Providence,
Rhode Island  02940-3027.  For further  information  regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331-1710.
