(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
calculated by subtracting the value of an investment in the Fund at the
beginning of each specified period from the value at the end of the period and
dividing the remainder by the value of the investment at the beginning of the
period and expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that
all income dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at
prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total return does
not reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period of
less than one year is not annualized. Total return for a period more than one
year represents the average annual total return.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal. Total
return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for
trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of
closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Net asset
value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total liabilities
divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are subject to
change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at January 31, 2005.

(a)  Private Placement. Restricted as to resale and may not have a readily
     available market.
(b)  Illiquid security.
(c)  These securities generally pay interest at rates which are periodically
     pre-determined by reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These
     base lending rates are generally either the lending rate offered by one or
     more major European banks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate
     ("LIBOR") or the prime rate offered by one or more major United States
     banks, or the certificate of deposit rate. These securities are generally
     considered to be restricted as the Fund is ordinarily contractually
     obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or borrower prior to
     disposition.
(d)  Unsettled security, coupon rate undetermined at January 31, 2005.
(e)  Fair-valued security.
(f)  Floating Rate Security. Interest rate shown is the rate in effect at
     January 31, 2005.
(g)  144A Security--Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the

PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
January 31, 2005 (unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Floating Rate Income Fund (the "Fund") was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on June 19, 2003. Prior to commencing operations on August 29,
2003, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its organization
and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended. PA Fund Management LLC (the "Investment
Manager") serves as the Fund's Investment Manager and is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Global Investors of America L.P. ("Allianz
Global"). Allianz Global is an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz
AG. The Fund has an unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock
authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to seek high current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital by investing primarily in floating rate debt
instruments, a substantial portion of which will be senior floating rate loans.
The ability of the issuers of the Fund's investments to meet their obligations
may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. Portfolio securities and other
financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available or
if a development/event occurs that may impact the value of the security or
financial instrument, may be fair-valued in good faith pursuant to procedures
established by the Board of Trustees. The Fund's investments in senior floating
rate loans ("Senior Loans") are valued in accordance with guidelines established
by the Board of Trustees. Under the Fund's guidelines, Senior Loans for which a
secondary market exists will be valued by an independent pricing service. Other
Senior Loans are valued at fair value by Pacific Investment Management Company
LLC (the Sub-Adviser), an affiliate of the Investment Manager, pursuant to
procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Such procedures include
consideration and evaluation of: (1) the creditworthiness of the borrower and
any intermediate participants; (2) the term of the Senior Loan; (3) recent
prices in the market for similar loans, if any; (4) recent prices in the market
for loans of similar quality, coupon rate, and period until next interest rate
reset and maturity, and (5) general economic and market conditions affecting the
fair value of the Senior Loan. Other portfolio securities and financial
instruments are valued by an independent pricing service, dealer quotations, or
are valued at the last sale price on the exchange that is the primary market for
such securities, or the last quoted bid price for those securities for which the
over-the-counter market is the primary market or for listed securities in which
there were no sales. The independent pricing service uses information provided
by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating
to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Exchange traded
options, futures and options on futures are valued at the settlement price
determined by the relevant exchange. Short-term investments maturing in 60 days
or less are valued at amortized cost, if their original maturity was 60 days or
less, or by amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the
original term to maturity exceeded 60 days. The prices used by the Fund to value
securities may differ from the value that would be realized if the securities
were sold and the difference could be material to the financial statements. The
Fund's net asset value is determined weekly on the last business day of the week
at the close of regular trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New
York Stock Exchange.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method. Facility fees and
other fees (such as origination fees) received by the Fund are amortized as
income over the expected term of the loan. Commitment fees received by the Fund
relating to unfunded purchase commitments are deferred and amortized to facility
fee income over the period of the commitment.

                                       16
<Page>

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to $1,653,753 earned from swaps.

(e) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the foreign
currency market value of investments and other assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are translated at the prevailing exchange rate
at the end of the period; and (2) purchases and sales, income and expenses are
translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates of such
transactions. The resulting net foreign currency gain or loss is included in the
Statement of Operations.

The Fund does not generally isolate that portion of the results of operations
arising as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates from the
fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities.
Accordingly, such foreign currency gain (loss) is included in net realized and
unrealized gain (loss) on investments. However, the Fund does isolate the effect
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when determining the gain or
loss upon the sale or maturity of foreign currency denominated debt obligations
pursuant to U.S. federal income tax regulations; such amount is categorized as
foreign currency gain or loss for both financial reporting and income tax
reporting purposes.

(f) SENIOR LOANS
The Fund purchases assignments of Senior Loans originated, negotiated and
structured by a U.S. or foreign commercial bank, insurance company, finance
company or other financial institution (the "Agent") for a lending syndicate of
financial institutions ("Lenders"). When purchasing an assignment, the Fund
succeeds all the rights and obligations under the loan agreement with the same
rights and obligations as the assigning Lender. Assignments may, however, be
arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and potential
assignors, and the rights and obligations acquired by the purchaser of an
assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held by the
assigning Lender.

(g) INTEREST RATE/CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The Fund enters into interest rate and credit default swap contracts ("swaps")
for investment purposes, to manage its interest rate and credit risk or to add
leverage.

As a seller in a credit default swap contract, the Fund would be required to pay
the par or other agreed-upon value of a referenced debt obligation to the
counterparty in the event of a default by a third party, such as a U.S. or
foreign corporate issuer, on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund
would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term
of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default
occurs, the Fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment
obligations. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and recorded as realized
gain (loss).

The Fund may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge
against the risk of default of debt securities held, in which case the Fund
would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding paragraph. As a
purchaser of a credit default swap contract, the Fund would receive the par or
other agreed upon value of a referenced debt obligation from the counterparty in
the event of default by a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate
issuer on

                                       17
<Page>

the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund would make periodic payments
to the counterparty over the term of the contract provided no event of default
has occurred. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and charged to recorded
to realized gains (loss).

Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange by the Fund with a
counterparty of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g.,
an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a
notional amount of principal. Net periodic payments received by the Fund are
included as part of net realized gain/(loss) on the Statement of Operations.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Sub-Adviser based upon quotations
from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation in the Fund's Statement of Operations. For a credit
default swap sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the
Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as
the cost of the referenced debt obligation purchased/received. For a credit
default swap purchased by the Fund, the agreed upon amount received by the Fund
in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as
proceeds from sale/delivery of the referenced debt obligation and the resulting
gain or loss realized on the referenced debt obligation is recorded as such by
the Fund.

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no
liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may
default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the
contractual terms in the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes
in net interest rates.

(h) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Fund is required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Fund as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of an
imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets and the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(i) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
The Fund may purchase and write (sell) put and call options for hedging and/or
risk management purposes. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that
the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally,
the Fund bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities
acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by the premiums paid.
The proceeds from the securities sold through the exercise of put options is
decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as a liability and
is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. These liabilities are reflected as options written in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Premiums received from writing options
which expire unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain.
The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an written
option could result in the Fund purchasing a security at a price different from
the current market price.

                                       18
<Page>

(j) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of
hedging against foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated
investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also
enter into these contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign
currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country
to another. A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two
parties to buy and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The
market value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in
forward currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at
the applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized appreciation or
depreciation is recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the
forward contract matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon
entering these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

(k) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund enters into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms whereby it purchases securities under agreements to resell at an
agreed upon price and date ("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are
carried at the contract amount in the financial statements. Collateral pledged
(the securities received), which consists primarily of U.S. government
obligations and asset-backed securities, are held by the custodian bank until
maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the repurchase agreements
and the procedures adopted by the Fund require that the market value of the
collateral, including accrued interest thereon, is sufficient in the event of
default by the counterparty. If the counterparty defaults and the value of the
collateral declines or if the counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

(l) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES
The Fund benefits from an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian and
accounting agent fees. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing
securities, they would have generated income for the Fund.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager. Subject to the supervision of the Fund's Board of
Trustees, the Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or
through others selected by it, the Fund's investment activities business affairs
and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment
Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.75% of
the Fund's average weekly total managed assets. Total managed assets refer to

return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.39% of the Fund's
average weekly total managed assets for the period from commencement of
operations through August 31, 2008. Commencing September 1, 2008, the Investment
Manager will pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee at the annual rate of 0.55% of
the Fund's average weekly total managed assets. The Investment Manager informed

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

5. SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS
On February 4, 2005, a dividend of $0.100482 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable March 4, 2005 to shareholders of record on February 18,

On March 4, 2005, a dividend of $0.105323 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable April 1, 2005 to shareholders of record on March 18, 2005.

6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On September 13, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
announced that the Investment Manager and certain of its affiliates had agreed
to a settlement of charges that they and certain of their officers had,

                                       22
<Page>

among other things, violated various antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws in connection with an alleged market-timing arrangement
involving trading of shares of various open-end investment companies ("open-end"
funds) advised or distributed by the Investment Manager and certain of its
affiliates. In their settlement with the Commission, the Investment Manager and
their affiliates consented to the entry of an order by the Commission and,
without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order, agreed to
implement certain compliance and governance changes and consented to
cease-and-desist orders and censures. In addition, the Investment Manager and
its affiliates agreed to pay civil money penalties in the aggregate amount $40
million and to pay disgorgement in the amount of $10 million, for an aggregate
payment of $50 million. In connection with the settlement, the Investment
Manager and its affiliates have been dismissed from the related complaint the
Commission filed on May 6, 2004 in the U.S. District Court in the Southern
District of New York. Neither the complaint nor the order alleges any
inappropriate activity took place with respect to the Fund.

In a related action on June 1, 2004, the Attorney General of the State of New
Jersey announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with Allianz
Global and certain other affiliates of the Investment Manager, in connection
with a complaint filed by the New Jersey Attorney General ("NJAG") on February
17, 2004. The NJAG dismissed claims against the Sub-Adviser, which had been part
of the same complaint. In the settlement, Allianz Global and other named
affiliates neither admitted nor denied the allegations or conclusions of law,
but did agree to pay New Jersey a civil fine of $15 million and $3 million for
investigative costs and further potential enforcement initiatives against
unrelated parties. They also undertook to implement certain governance changes.
The complaint relating to the settlement contained allegations arising out of
the same matters that were subject of the Commission order regarding market
timing described above.

On September 15, 2004, the Commission announced that the Investment Manager and
certain of its affiliates agreed to settle an enforcement action in connection
with charges that they violated various antifraud and other provisions of
federal securities laws as a result of, among other things, their failure to
disclose to the board of trustees and shareholders of various open-end funds
advised or distributed by the Investment Manager and its affiliates material
facts and conflicts of interest that arose from their use of brokerage
commissions on portfolio transactions to pay for so-called "shelf space"
arrangements with certain broker-dealers. In the settlement, the Investment
Manager and its affiliates consented to the entry of an order by the Commission
without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order. In connection
with the settlement, the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed to
undertake certain compliance and disclosure reforms and consented to
cease-and-desist orders and censures. In addition, the Manager and these
affiliates agreed to jointly pay a civil money penalty of $5 million and to pay
disgorgement of $6.6 million based upon the amount of brokerage commissions
alleged to have been paid by such open-end funds in connection with these
arrangements (and related interest). In a related action, the California
Attorney General announced on September 15, 2004 that it had entered an
agreement with an affiliate of the Investment Manager in resolution of an
investigation into matters that are similar to those discussed in the
Commission's order. The settlement agreement resolves matters described in the
complaint filed by the California Attorney General in the Superior Court of the
State of California alleging, among other things, that this affiliate violated
certain antifraud provisions of California law by failing to disclose matters
related to the shelf-space arrangements described above. In the settlement
agreement, the affiliate did not admit to any liability but agreed to pay $5
million in civil penalties and $4 million in recognition of the California
Attorney General's fees and costs associated with the investigation and related
matters. Neither the Commission's order nor the California Attorney General's
complaint alleges any inappropriate activity took place with respect to the
Fund.

Since February 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and certain of
their affiliates have been named as defendants in 14 lawsuits filed in U.S.
District Court in the Southern District of New York, the Central District of
California and the Districts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ten of those
lawsuits concern "market timing," and they have been transferred to and
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland; the remaining four lawsuits concern "revenue sharing" with
brokers offering "shelf space" and have been consolidated into a single action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The lawsuits have
been commenced as putative class actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed shares of affiliated funds during specified periods or as
derivative actions on behalf of the funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the
same facts that are the subject of the regulatory proceedings discussed above.
The lawsuits seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages plus
interest and, in some cases, punitive damages, the rescission of investment
advisory contracts, the return of fees paid under those contracts and
restitution. The Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that other
similar lawsuits may be filed in U.S. federal or state courts naming as
defendants the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, Allianz Global, the Fund,
other open- and closed-end funds advised or distributed by the Investment
Manager, the SubAdviser and/or their affiliates, the boards of trustees of those
funds, and/or other affiliates and their employees.

                                       23

Under Section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, if any of the various
regulatory proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, Allianz Global and/or their affiliates,
they and their affiliates would, in the absence of exemptive relief granted by
the Commission, be barred from serving as an investment adviser/sub-adviser or
principal underwriter for any registered investment company, including the Fund.

In connection with an inquiry from the Commission concerning the status of the
New Jersey settlement described above under Section 9(a), the Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser, and certain of their affiliates (together, the
"Applicants") have sought exemptive relief from the Commission under Section
9(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission has granted the
Applicants a temporary exemption from the provisions of Section 9(a) with
respect to the New Jersey settlement until the earlier of (i) September 13, 2006
and (ii) the date on which the Commission takes final action on their
application for a permanent order. There is no assurance that the Commission
will issue a permanent order.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from these
matters could lead to a decrease in the market price of the Fund's shares or
other adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders. However, the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Fund or on the Investment Manager's or
the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment advisory services
relating to the Fund.

7. CORPORATE CHANGES
On September 14, 2004, David C. Flattum was appointed to the Board of Trustees
and Youse Guia was named as the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer. On October 5,
2004, the Board of Trustees elected Robert E. Connor as Chairman. On December
14, 2004, Thomas J. Fuccillo was appointed as the Fund's Secretary.
