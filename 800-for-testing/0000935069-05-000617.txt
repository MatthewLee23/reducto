                                December 31, 2004


TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com/funds.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2004.

     The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends  and income.  The Trust will attempt
to  achieve  its  investment   objective  by  investing,   under  normal  market
conditions,  at least 80% of its assets in dividend paying  securities  (such as
common and preferred stock) or other income producing  securities (such as fixed
income  debt  securities  and  securities  that  are  convertible   into  equity
securities).

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by the Adviser.

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are  generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close, market conditions change significantly, certain
foreign securities may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the
Board.  Debt instruments that are not credit impaired with remaining  maturities
of 60 days or less are valued at  amortized  cost,  unless the Board  determines
such does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these securities
will be valued at their fair value as determined by the Board.  Debt instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the latest average of the bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under  procedures
established by and under the general  supervision  of the Board.  Fair valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or with other brokers or dealers
that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the  Adviser  and  reviewed by the
Board.  Under the  terms of a  typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Trust  takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Trust to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Trust's holding period.
The Trust will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 100% of the dollar
amount invested by the Trust in each agreement.  The Trust will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Trust may be delayed or limited.

     OPTIONS.  The Trust may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Trust  receives a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial instrument  underlying the option. The Trust would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is  written  and the date on which the  option is  terminated.  The Trust
would  realize  a gain,  to the  extent  of the  premium,  if the  price  of the
financial instrument increases or stays the same between those dates.

     As a purchaser  of put  options,  the Trust pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

the price of the underlying  security  declines,  the Trust would realize a gain
upon sale or  exercise.  If the price of the  underlying  security  increases or
stays the same, the Trust would realize a loss upon sale or at expiration  date,
but only to the extent of the premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money,"  "at-the-money" and "out-of-the-money,"  respectively. The Trust
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the
price of the underlying security will remain stable or advance moderately during
the option period and (c) out-of-the-money call options when the Adviser expects
that the premiums received from writing the call option plus the appreciation in
market price of the underlying security up to the exercise price will be greater
than the  appreciation  in the price of the underlying  security alone. In these
circumstances,  if the market price of the underlying  security declines and the
security is sold at this lower price,  the amount of any  realized  loss will be
offset wholly or in part by the premium received. Out-of-the-money, at-the-money
and  in-the-money put options (the reverse of call options as to the relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions.

     The option  activity for the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2004 was

</TABLE>

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of the Trust are
maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments and
other assets and liabilities  are translated  into U.S.  dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at the end of the period, and purchases and sales of investment
securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing
on the respective dates of such transactions. Unrealized gains and losses, which
result from changes in foreign exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of
securities,  have  been  included  in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on
investments and foreign  currency  translations.  Net realized  foreign currency
gains and losses  resulting  from  changes in  exchange  rates  include  foreign
currency gains and losses  between trade date and settlement  date on investment
securities  transactions,  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  difference
between the amounts of interest and dividends recorded on the books of the Trust
and the amounts  actually  received.  The portion of foreign  currency gains and
losses  related to  fluctuation in exchange rates between the initial trade date
and  subsequent  sale  trade  date  is  included  in  realized   gain/(loss)  on
investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Trust may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial  information about companies and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and capital gain
distributions  are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from that  determined  by U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These  differences  are  primarily  due to differing  treatments of
income  and gains on various  investment  securities  held by the Trust,  timing
differences and differing characterizations of distributions made by the Trust.

     For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  reclassifications  were  made to
decrease   accumulated  net  investment  income  by  $556,558  and  to  decrease
accumulated  net  realized  loss on  investments,  options and foreign  currency
transactions by $556,558.

     The tax character of distributions  paid during the year ended December 31,
2004 was as follows:

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended  (the  "Code")  and comply with the  requirements  of the Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all
of its net investment  company taxable income and net capital gains.  Therefore,
no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     Dividends  and interest  from  non-U.S.  sources  received by the Trust are
generally subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%. Such
withholding  taxes may be reduced or  eliminated  under the terms of  applicable
U.S.  income tax treaties,  and the Trust  intends to undertake  any  procedural
steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

     As of December 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

            Net unrealized appreciation on investments ........    $143,293,748
            Net unrealized appreciation on foreign

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Trust has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Trust will pay the Adviser on the first  business day of each
month a fee for the  previous  month  equal on an  annual  basis to 1.00% of the
value of the Trust's average weekly net assets  including the liquidation  value
of the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. In accordance with the Advisory  Agreement,
the Adviser provides a continuous  investment  program for the Trust's portfolio
and  oversees  the  administration  of all aspects of the Trust's  business  and
affairs.  The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on the incremental
assets  attributable to the liquidation value of the Cumulative  Preferred Stock
if the total  return of the net asset  value of the common  shares of the Trust,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of the Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.

     The Fund's  total  return on the net asset  value of the  common  shares is
monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the net asset
value of the common shares  exceeds the stated  dividend rate of the  Cumulative
Preferred Stock for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund's
total  return on the net asset value of the common  shares  exceeded  the stated
dividend rate of all outstanding  preferred  stock.  Thus,  management fees were
accrued on these assets.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, Gabelli & Company,  Inc. ("Gabelli
&Company"),  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $1,993,089  in brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Trust.

     The cost of  calculating  the  Trust's net asset value per share is a Trust
expense pursuant to the Investment  Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the
Adviser.  During the year ended  December 31,  2004,  the Trust  reimbursed  the
Adviser  $34,800 in connection  with the cost of computing the Trust's net asset
value.

     The Trust is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer  in the  amount of $8,581  for the  period of
October 1, 2004 through  December 31, 2004 which is included in payroll  expense
in the Statement of Operations.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from sales of securities for the
year ended  December  31, 2004,  other than  short-term  securities,  aggregated
$1,288,414,031 and $371,762,819, respectively.

5.  CAPITAL.  The Trust is  authorized  to issue an  unlimited  number of common
shares of beneficial interest,  par value $.001 per share. The Board of Trustees
of the Trust has authorized the repurchase of its shares in the open market when
the shares are trading at a discount  of 7.5% or more (or such other  percentage
as the Board may  determine  from time to time) from the net asset  value of the
shares.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Trust repurchased  245,700
shares of beneficial  interest in the open market at a cost of $4,246,068 and an
average discount of approximately  8.94% from its net asset value. All shares of
beneficial interest repurchased have been retired.

     Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     On October 12, 2004, the Trust received net proceeds of $77,255,000  (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $2,520,000  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$225,000)  from the  public  offering  of  3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred Shares.  Commencing  October 12, 2009 and thereafter,  the
Trust, at its option, may redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares
in  whole or in part at the  liquidation  value  price.  During  the year  ended
December  31,  2004,  the  Trust  did not  repurchase  any  shares  of  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred  Shares.  At December  31, 2004,  3,200,000  shares of the
5.875%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares  were  outstanding  and  accrued
dividends amounted to $65,278.

     On October 12, 2004, the Trust received net proceeds of $217,425,000 (after
underwriting   discounts  of  $2,200,000  and  estimated  offering  expenses  of
$375,000) from the public  offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares
of Series C Auction Market Preferred Shares, respectively. The dividend rate, as
set by the auction process, which is generally held every 7 days, is expected to
vary with  short-term  interest  rates.  The  Rates of  Series B Auction  Market
Preferred  Shares  ranged  from 1.80% to 2.80% from  October  12,  2004  through
December 31, 2004. The Rates of Series C Auction Market  Preferred Shares ranged
from 1.84% to 2.69% from  October 12, 2004 through  December 31, 2004.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit  an order to hold,  bid or sell  such  shares  on each
auction date.  Series B and C Auction Market Preferred  Shares  shareholders may
also trade shares in the secondary market.  The Trust, at its option, may redeem
the Series B and C Auction  Market  Preferred  Shares in whole or in part at the
liquidation  value price at any time.  During the year ended  December 31, 2004,
the  Trust did not  repurchase  any  shares  of  Series B and C  Auction  Market
Preferred  Shares.  At December 31, 2004, 4,000 and 4,800 shares of the Series B
and C  Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares  were  outstanding  with  an
annualized dividend rate of 2.80 and 2.69 percent and accrued dividends amounted
to $23,333 and $8,967, respectively.

     The holders of Cumulative  Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of common stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with holders of shares of common stock as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of common
stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, would be required to:
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other things,  changes in the Trust's  subclassification  as a
closed-end   investment  company  or  changes  in  its  fundamental   investment
restrictions.  The Trust's Articles of Incorporation,  as amended, authorize the
issuance  of an  unlimited  number  of shares  of  $0.001  par value  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock
and results in the financial  leveraging of the common  stock.  Such  leveraging
tends to  magnify  both the risks  and  opportunities  to  common  shareholders.
Dividends on shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Trust
is required to meet certain asset coverage tests as required by the 1940 Act and
by each series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stocks'  Statement of Preferences  with
respect to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Trust  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not correct  such  failure,  the Trust may be required to
redeem,  in part or in full,  the  5.875%  Series A,  Series B Auction  Rate and
Series C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock at a redemption  price of $25,
$25,000,  and  $25,000,  respectively,  per share  plus an  amount  equal to the
accumulated and unpaid dividends whether or not declared on such shares in order
to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the foregoing asset
requirements  could  restrict  the Trust's  ability to pay  dividends  to common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income received on the Trust's assets may vary in a manner unrelated
to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which  could  have  either a  beneficial  or
detrimental  impact  on net  investment  income  and gains  available  to common
shareholders.

     Under  Emerging   Issues  Task  Force  (EITF)   promulgating   Topic  D-98,
Classification  and  Measurement of Redeemable  Securities,  which was issued on
July 19, 2001, preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets
are to be  classified  outside  of  permanent  equity  to the  extent  that  the
redemption is at a fixed or  determinable  price and at the option of the holder
or upon the  occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the
issuer.  In  accordance  with the guidance of the EITF,  the Trust's  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock  is  classified   outside  of  permanent   equity  (net  assets
attributable  to  common  stock  shareholders)  in  the  accompanying  financial
statements.

6. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney  General of the State ofNew York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund  shares  trading  practices.  Gabelli  Asset  Management  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent company,  is responding to these  requests.  TheTrust does not
believe that these  matters will have a material  adverse  effect on the Trust's
financial position or the results of its operations.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Trust's  maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is
unknown. However, the Trust has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material respects, the financial position of The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
(the "Trust") at December 31, 2004,  the results of its  operations for the year
then ended,  and the changes in its net assets and the financial  highlights for
the year then  ended and for the  period  November  28,  2003  (commencement  of
investment  operations) through December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial
statements  and  financial  highlights  (hereafter  referred  to  as  "financial
statements")   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Trust's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial  statements in accordance
with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United
States).  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2004 by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable  basis for
our opinion.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

   It is the policy of The Gabelli  Dividend & Income Trust  ("Dividend & Income
Trust") to automatically reinvest dividends.  As a "registered"  shareholder you
automatically  become a participant in the Dividend & Income  Trust's  Automatic
Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan  authorizes  the Dividend &
Income  Trust to issue  shares  to  participants  upon an income  dividend  or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of the Dividend & Income Trust.  Plan
participants  may send their  stock  certificates  to  EquiServe  Trust  Company
("EquiServe")  to be held in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.  Registered
shareholders  wishing to receive  their  distribution  in cash must  submit this
request in writing to:

                       The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43011
                            Providence, RI 02940-3011

   Shareholders  requesting  this cash election  must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

   SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must do
so in writing or by telephone. Please submit your request to the above mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

   If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or nominee,  you should
contact such institution.  If such institution is not participating in the Plan,
your account will be credited with a cash  dividend.  In order to participate in
the Plan through  such  institution,  it may be  necessary  for you to have your
shares  taken out of  "street  name" and  re-registered  in your own name.  Once
registered in your own name your  dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested.
Certain brokers participate in the Plan.  Shareholders holding shares in "street
name"  at   participating   institutions   will  have  dividends   automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

   The number of shares of Common Shares distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the Plan,
whenever  the market  price of the Dividend & Income  Trust's  Common  Shares is
equal to or exceeds net asset  value at the time shares are valued for  purposes
of determining the number of shares  equivalent to the cash dividends or capital
gains distribution,  participants are issued Common Shares valued at the greater
of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined or (ii) 95% of the then
current  market  price of the  Dividend  & Income  Trust's  Common  Shares.  The
valuation date is the dividend or distribution  payment date or, if that date is
not a New York Stock  Exchange  trading  day,  the next  trading day. If the net
asset  value of the Common  Stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds  the market
price of the Common Shares, participants will receive shares from the Dividend &
Income  Trust  valued at market  price.  If the  Dividend & Income  Trust should
declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash, EquiServe
will buy Common Shares in the open market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or
elsewhere,  for the participants' accounts,  except that EquiServe will endeavor
to terminate  purchases in the open market and cause the Dividend & Income Trust
to issue  shares  at net asset  value if,  following  the  commencement  of such
purchases,  the market value of the Common  Shares  exceeds the then current net
asset value.

   The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will
not  relieve  participants  of any  income  tax  which  may be  payable  on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

   The Dividend & Income Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan
at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by EquiServe on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another vehicle for our  shareholders
to  increase  their  investment  in the  Dividend  & Income  Trust.  In order to
participate in the Voluntary Cash Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have their
shares registered in their own name.

   Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments in the Dividend & Income
Trust's shares at the then current market price. Shareholders may send an amount
from $250 to $10,000.  EquiServe will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market on or about the 1st and 15th of each month.  EquiServe  will charge
each shareholder who participates  $0.75, plus a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary  cash payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43011,  Providence,  RI
02940-3011  such that  EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately  10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before  the  investment  date  shall be held  for  investment  in the  following
investment  period.  A  payment  may be  withdrawn  without  charge if notice is
received by EquiServe at least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

   For more information  regarding the Dividend  Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Dividend & Income Trust.

                           (d) N/A

     (f) The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal   accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's  financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were  attributed  to work  performed by persons

         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant  for  each  of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the
         registrant was $0 in 2004 and $0 in 2003.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                  GABELLI ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. AND AFFILIATES

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------









         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Investors,  Inc., Gabelli Funds,
LLC and Gabelli Advisers, Inc.  (collectively,  the "Advisers") to determine how
to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio  securities  held by  their  clients,
including the  procedures  that the Advisers use when a vote presents a conflict
between the interests of the  shareholders  of an investment  company managed by
one of the Advisers,  on the one hand, and those of the Advisers;  the principal
underwriter;  or any affiliated person of the investment company,  the Advisers,
or the principal underwriter. These procedures will not apply where the Advisers
do not have voting discretion or where the Advisers have agreed with a client to
vote the client's  proxies in accordance with specific  guidelines or procedures
supplied by the client (to the extent permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

     The Proxy  Voting  Committee  was  originally  formed in April 1989 for the
purpose of formulating  guidelines  and reviewing  proxy  statements  within the
parameters set by the substantive proxy voting guidelines  originally  published
by GAMCO Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are
appended as Exhibit A. The Committee will include  representatives  of Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee. As of December 31, 2004, the members are:



                  Bruce N. Alpert, Chief Operating Officer of Gabelli Funds, LLC

                  Ivan Arteaga, Portfolio Manager

                  Caesar M. P. Bryan, Portfolio Manager

                  Stephen DeTore, Deputy General Counsel

                  Joshua Fenton, Director of Buy-Side Research

                  Douglas R. Jamieson, Chief Operating Officer of GAMCO

                  James E. McKee, General Counsel

                  Karyn-Marie Prylucki, Director of Proxy Voting Services
<PAGE>

                  William S. Selby, Managing Director of GAMCO

                  Howard F. Ward, Portfolio Manager

                  Peter D. Zaglio, Senior Vice President

         Peter D. Zaglio  currently  chairs the Committee.  In his absence,  the
Director of Research will chair the Committee. Meetings are held on an as needed
basis to form views on the manner in which the  Advisers  should vote proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         For matters  submitted to the  Committee,  each member of the Committee
will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the proxy statement,  any relevant
third party  research,  a summary of any views provided by the Chief  Investment
Officer and any recommendations by Gabelli & Company,  Inc. analysts.  The Chief
Investment  Officer or the Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  analysts  may be invited to
present  their  viewpoints.  If the Legal  Department  believes  that the matter
before the  committee  is one with  respect to which a conflict of interest  may
exist between the Advisers and their clients, counsel will provide an opinion to
the  Committee  concerning  the  conflict.  If the  matter  is one in which  the
interests of the clients of one or more of Advisers may diverge, counsel will so
advise and the  Committee  may make  different  recommendations  as to different
clients.  For any matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
counsel will provide an opinion  concerning  the likely risks and merits of such
an appraisal action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.
<PAGE>

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II. SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III. CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations

         - Legal Department

         - Proxy Department

         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV. VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers' staff may request proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

          If a client  wishes to receive a proxy  voting  record on a quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.
<PAGE>

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]

                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department

                  One Corporate Center

                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V. VOTING PROCEDURES



1. Custodian banks,  outside brokerage firms and First Clearing  Corporation are
responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.
o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In  the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions from the proxy committee, the votes are cast and
recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:

         Security Name and Cusip Number

         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)

         Client Name
<PAGE>

         Adviser or Fund Account Number

         Directors' Recommendation

         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue

         The rationale for the vote when it is appropriate

Records prior to the institution of the PROXY EDGE system include:

         Security name

         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)

         Date of Meeting

         Name of Custodian

         Name of Client

         Custodian Account Number

         Adviser or Fund Account Number

         Directors' recommendation

         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue

         Date the proxy statement was received and by whom

         Name of person posting the vote

         Date and method by which the vote was cast

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly,  semi-annual or annual basis.  On
     an annual  basis,  all  registered  investment  companies  file their Proxy
     Voting History for the period July 1 - June 30 on Form N-PX.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.
<PAGE>

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o    Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:
     A call is placed to ADP requesting  legal  proxies.  The VAFs are then sent
     overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual  legal proxies and sends them back
     via  overnight.  A lead-time  of at least two weeks prior to the meeting is
     needed to do this.  Alternatively,  the procedures detailed below for banks
     not using ADP may be implemented.

o    Banks and brokerage  firms  issuing  proxies  directly:  The bank is called
     and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A  limited   Power  of  Attorney   appointing   the   attendee  an  Adviser
     representative.

o    A list of all  shares  being  voted by  custodian  only.  Client  names and
     account numbers are not included.  This list must be presented,  along with
     the  proxies,  to the  Inspectors  of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least
     one-half  hour prior to the scheduled  start of the meeting.  The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e.  determine if the vote have  previously been
     cast, if the votes have been  rescinded,  etc. votes have  previously  been
     cast, etc.).

o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.

o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

                            GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GABELLI ASSET  MANAGEMENT  INC. to vote in the best economic
interests of our clients. As we state in our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Historical  responsiveness  to shareholders
           This may include such areas as:

           -Paying greenmail

           -Failure to adopt  shareholder  resolutions  receiving  a majority of
            shareholder votes

o        Qualifications
o        Nominating committee in place
o        Number of outside directors on the board
o        Attendance at meetings
o        Overall performance


                              SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for auditors.

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.
<PAGE>

                                CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place, we will generally not support attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.

                        INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Future use of additional shares
           -Stock split

           -Stock option or other executive compensation plan

           -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet

           -Aid in restructuring

           -Improve credit rating

           -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense

o        Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
         stock option plans
o        Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect


We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

                               CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.
<PAGE>

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.

                     DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

                            EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

                              FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by- case basis.

NOTE:  CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.

                            ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.
<PAGE>

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.

                CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

                   MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

                                 MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

                                NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.



In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                       OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o        State of Incorporation
o        Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o        Other mitigating factors
<PAGE>

                                   POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

                                 REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

                               STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o        Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o        Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o        Method of payment
o        Amount of  stock  already authorized  but not yet issued under existing
         stock option plans


                         SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

               LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.
