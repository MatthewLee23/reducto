Letter to Stockholders

GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW
    The pace of global growth experienced in 2004, currently estimated at close
to 5%, was the fastest for two decades. However, going forward growth should
slow as the global economy transitions from an above-trend recovery phase to a
slower paced expansion phase and as monetary policy is tightened.

    In the U.S., fiscal stimulus will drop off in 2005. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts US Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth of 3.3% for 2005 -- at or slightly above trend. Core
inflation is now annualizing at 2.4%. There appears to be more inflation in the
pipeline at the core crude material and the intermediate price stages, while
unit labor costs in the second and third quarters have risen at close to 2% as
productivity has declined. Further price pressures will come from diminishing
slack in the economy and a falling U.S. dollar.

    The Japanese and Euroland economies have been the most badly affected by
the summer "soft patch." In Japan, real GDP growth has come to a complete
standstill as can be seen in the recently revised GDP data, which has been
recalculated using a new methodology. The new data appears to indicate that
inventories and a slump in public consumption were initially responsible for
the downturn. Interest rates are expected to remain on hold for at least the
first half of 2005 with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hovering at around zero.
The OECD forecasts Japanese GDP growth of 2.1% in 2005, but that may be a
little optimistic.

    Euroland has struggled this year with GDP growth very weak in the second
half of 2004 due to the slowdown in the global economy, a strong euro and
ongoing weak domestic demand. The drop in the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)
surveys in December to just above 50 highlights just how much economic momentum
has been lost. The adjustment to domestic demand growth from export-led growth
in 2005 will be difficult. We think the European Central Bank will relent and
remain on hold until growth firms and the labor market improves.

    The best stock market performances this year were the Emerging and the
Eastern European markets. As an asset class the mid- and small-cap sectors had
very strong performance. Their out-performance across the globe was almost
unprecedented. Very low interest rates, better access to financing due to
market interest in high yield instruments, and a decline in volatility and risk
aversion all contributed strongly to the performance of this asset class. It is
unlikely that 2005 will be so kind for small- and mid-cap stocks due to higher
borrowing rates and slower economic growth.

    With regard to the much discussed weakness in the US dollar, it decreased
by 10.44% against the Swiss franc in 2003 and continued its decline
particularly after the election in 2004. It finished the year down 8% against
the Swiss franc.

Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2005. In Switzerland, the Swiss stock exchange
has decided that all companies listed on the exchange are obliged to apply
either IFRS or US generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP) as their
accounting standard from 2005 onwards, in order to remain in the main trading
segment, namely the Swiss Performance Index (SPI). According to a study
conducted by UBS, 87% of the companies already apply IFRS accounting standards,
11% use US GAAP and 2% use Swiss GAAP. The main changes involve the
amortization of goodwill, the expensing of employee stock options, and the
funding of pensions.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    Economic growth in Switzerland has lost some of its momentum. However, the
Swiss National Bank (SNB) still anticipates economic growth to be close to 2%
for the full year of 2004. On the assumption that the three-month LIBOR rate
will remain unchanged at 0.75%, the SNB expects growth of 1.5% to 2% for next
year and an inflation rate of 1.1% in 2005 and 1.3% in 2006.

    The unemployment rate increased from 3.7% at the end of the third quarter
to 4% at the end of the year.

    The flattening of the yield curve continues, as the ten-year spot interest
rate on Confederation bonds continued its decrease and short-term interest
rates (3-6 months) continued their increase. The rate on the 10-year government
bond reached 2.72% at the end of the year.

SWISS MARKET NEWS
    On November 15, 2004, two new indices were launched to supplement the
existing Swiss Market Index (SMI): the SMI MID (SMIMX), which focuses on the
mid-cap segment and contains a maximum of 30 of the largest most liquid mid-cap
stocks in the Swiss equity market, which are NOT represented in the blue-chip
SMI index, and the SMI expanded (SMIEXX), which is composed of the SMI and the
SMIMX and therefore comprises a maximum of 60 stocks that are the largest and
most liquid stocks in the Swiss market.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE
    The Swiss market's 2004 return of 6.89% (in local currency) was a decent
performance when compared to the rest of continental Europe and to the US. A
closer look revealed that the SPI had a volatile year with significant ups and
downs. With regard to individual stocks, the year ended with reports of
accounting issues at Adecco and a provisions shortfall at Converium. With
regard to macro-economic and geo-political issues, the beginning of the year
was affected by the attacks in Madrid, the plunge in the US dollar starting in
mid-April and accentuated after the election, and the surge in oil prices to a
level of $50 in October.

    The best performances were small and mid-sized stocks. Small stocks
returned 24.19% with very thinly traded companies like Swiss Steel returning
159%, Quadrant returning 128%, and Zurich Airport returning 126%. Mid-cap
stocks also performed

                                      3

well with a return of 11%. The big laggards were the large-cap stocks, as
indicated by the 3.74% return of the SMI, an index that represents the 30
largest stocks in Switzerland. Small and mid-cap companies have superior growth
and we can see an increasing interest in these areas in Switzerland. An
indication of this is the previously noted creation of an index of the largest
mid-cap stocks of Switzerland. We believe this is good news since it is likely
to increase the liquidity of these stocks.

    The Fund's performance has been particularly rewarding for US stockholders.
The total return of the shares of the Fund, after a very strong 41.76% in 2003,
was again excellent with a 23.65% return in 2004 (based on market price). For
the same periods the S&P 500 Index returned 28.68% and 10.87%, respectively.
The return of the portfolio's stocks, the effect of the fall of the dollar, and
the reduction of the Fund's discount to net asset value to 10.96% as of
December 31, 2004 all contributed favorably to the Fund's performance.

    The return on the Fund's net asset value was 7.75% in Swiss franc terms and
17.19% in US dollar terms. It outperformed the SMI thanks in part to its
exposure to small and mid-cap stocks such as Sulzer, Kuehne & Nagel, Logitech
and utility suppliers. Its overweight position in SMI's best performers such as
Syngenta (which increased by 47.3%) and Holcim (which increased by 24.02%) as
well as a shift out of the insurance stocks (which performed poorly by
declining -1.2%) helped as well. The Fund, however, was penalized by its low
exposure to banks (which outperformed towards the end of the year) and its
position in the biotechnology sector.

    The Fund's cumulative performance continues to be superior to its Swiss
peers and its benchmark. As of December 31, 2004 the Fund had a rating of three
stars from Morningstar*.

*Morningstar is an independent fund performance monitor. Its ratings reflect
historic risk-adjusted performance and may change monthly. Its ratings of one
(low) and five (high) stars are based on a fund's three- and five-year average
annual total returns with fee adjustments, and a risk factor that reflects fund
performance relative to three-month Treasury Bill monthly returns. Only 33% of
the funds in an investment category may receive four or five stars. As of
December 31, 2004, there were 10 funds in the Fund's asset category rated by
Morningstar.

OUTLOOK/STRATEGY
    Stock indices' volatility has been below historical norms for some time
now. High corporate cash flows and the negative level of real short-term
interest rates in the US have contributed to this situation. Investors are
pricing risk too low and it makes profitable trades difficult. This could
continue until either short-term US interest rates go above expected inflation
or a negative external event happens.

    The main characteristic of the market is the much higher correlation
between asset classes, which makes diversification difficult to achieve. In
addition, high leverage is frequently used by investors in order to squeeze out
the small returns currently found in most investment strategies.

    Given all these factors, as well as a slower economic growth, 2005 will be
more difficult. Careful stock picking and longer holding periods could be the
only viable strategies for now. Management would favor large-cap stocks and
defensive stocks in such areas as pharmaceuticals and food. The outlook for the
Swiss market is probably better than average due to its defensive
characteristics.

    Given the significant amount of free cash flow generated in 2004 by Swiss
companies, we expect 2005 to be a payback year for stockholders. Companies are
expected to launch new or continue share buybacks or increase dividend payouts.

    On the currency side, management expects some short term rebound in the US
dollar due to a widening of the short-term interest rate differential with
Europe and Switzerland and the unwinding of short positions betting against the
US dollar.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
    Pursuant to authorization by its Board of Directors, the Fund began open
market purchases of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and
has continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the
stock repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the
Fund's net asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect
upon the Fund's expense ratio and without realizing capital gains in order to
fund the repurchases. The Board has authorized the purchase of up to 250,000
shares

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATIONAND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
On December 31, 2004, there were no fair valued securities.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as an expense, net of any amount
receivable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax treaty between
the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and makes
distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of these
distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles.

F. SECURITIES LENDING
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their market value. For the initial transaction, the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish collateral with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or government securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction, the Fund requires
the

                                      24

                         THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of
the securities loaned. The Fund receives fees as compensation for lending its
securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the securities loan
at any time. On December 31, 2004, there were no securities on loan.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 2--FEESAND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.
and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich), is the Fund's advisor (the "Advisor"). The Fund
pays the Advisor an annual fee based on its month-end net assets which is
calculated and paid monthly at the following annual rates: 1.00% of the first
$60 million, 0.90% of the next $40 million, 0.80% of the next $100 million,
0.70% of the next $100 million, 0.65% of the next $100 million, 0.60% of the
next $100 million, 0.55% of the next $100 million, and 0.50% of such assets in
excess of $600 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Fund paid the
Advisor $2,968,162 in investment advisory fees. The Fund paid Hottinger & Cie
$47,325 in brokerage commissions for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Fund and the Advisor have agreed to share certain common expenses subject
to review and allocation by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board.
The Committee's allocations are based on its determination of the relative
benefits the Fund and the Advisor derive from the expenditures. During 2004,
the Committee allocated $9,300 of expenses incurred in connection with
publicizing the Fund as follows: $4,650 to the Fund and $4,650 to the Advisor.

Certain officers and directors of the Fund are also officers or directors of
HCC, Hottinger U.S., Inc. and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich). These persons are not
paid by the Fund for serving in these capacities.

NOTE 3--OTHERFEES
Citigroup Global Transaction Services, through its various affiliates, provides
certain administration and portfolio accounting services to the Fund.

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Fund's transfer agent. The Fund
pays the transfer agent an annual fee which is accrued daily and paid monthly.

Swiss American Securities Inc. is the Fund's U.S. custodian. Credit Suisse
First Boston is the Fund's Swiss sub-custodian. The Fund pays the custodian and
sub-custodian an annual fee.

The Fund pays each director who is not an interested person (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund, its Advisor, or Forum Administrative Services,
LLC, approximately $16,400 per annum in compensation, except for the Chairmen
of the Audit Committee and the Governance/Nominating Committee, to whom the
Fund pays an annual fee of approximately $18,000. In addition, the Fund pays
each disinterested director $750 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for
each committee meeting attended, if it is held separately. In addition, the
Fund reimburses directors who are not employees of

NOTE 5--FEDERALINCOME TAX AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 2004, accumulated net investment income and accumulated net
realized gain (loss) from investments and foreign currency transactions have
been adjusted for current period permanent book/tax differences which arose
principally from differing book/tax treatments of foreign currency
transactions. The following reclassification was a result of currency gains and
has no impact on the net assets of the Fund.

                      Unrealized appreciation $223,668,542
</TABLE>

NOTE 6--STOCKREPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and has continued
purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio and without realizing capital gains in order to fund the
repurchases. The Board has authorized the purchase of up to 250,000 shares in
2005. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund repurchased and retired
189,100 shares at an average price of $13.42 per share (including brokerage
commissions) and a weighted average discount of 15.48%. These repurchases,
which had a total cost of $2,537,410, resulted in an increase of $489,059 to
the Fund's net asset value.

NOTE 7--SUBSEQUENTEVENT
Effective January 20, 2005, a transfer of ownership interests in Hottinger et
Cie (Zurich), a 48.5% owner of the Advisor, occurred within the Hottinger
Group. Although the transfer has not caused any dimunition in the overall
control of the Advisor by the Hottinger Group, it is possible that the transfer
may be considered an "assignment" of the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement
with the Advisor, as such term is defined in the Act, with the effect of
causing the Investment Advisory Agreement to terminate in accordance with its
terms. Because of uncertainty whether this transfer has resulted in an
"assignment" of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board of Directors of
the Fund has determined to seek the approval of the Fund's stockholders of a
new investment advisory agreement at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders
scheduled for May, 2005. The Advisor has continued to provide services pursuant
to an interim advisory agreement which was approved by the Board of Directors
at a meeting held on December 7, 2004.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc.:

   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments,
as of December 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations for the year
then ended, statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Fund as of December 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

   The fundamental principle of the Codes is that the individuals covered by
the Codes have a fiduciary responsibility to the Fund and its stockholders.
They are therefore required at all times to place the interests of the Fund and
the stockholders first and to conduct all personal securities transactions in a
manner so as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest or abuse of
their position of trust.

   Portfolio managers and other individuals with knowledge of Fund investment
activities are prohibited from purchasing or selling a security during a
blackout period of 30 calendar days before and after the date on which the Fund
effects a trade in the same or a similar security. They are also prohibited
from engaging in short term trading of Swiss equity or equity linked
securities. Additionally, the Fund's portfolio managers are prohibited from
participating in any initial public offering or private placement of Swiss
equity and equity linked securities and other covered individuals must obtain
prior clearance before doing so.

   Any individual who violates the provisions of the Codes is required to
reverse the transaction and to turn over any resulting profits to the Fund. The
Fund and the Advisor have adopted compliance procedures and have appointed
compliance officers to ensure that all covered individuals comply with the
Codes.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

   The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

How does the Plan work?
Any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in whole or in part in
cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number of shares credited
to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will depend upon the
relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset value per share
on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as described below:

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price
increases to a level above the net asset value, AST will complete its
purchases, even though the result may be that the average price paid for the
purchases exceeds net asset value.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited) (concluded)


Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend will be reinvested in
additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase of whole
shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares (rounded to
three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:

   By mail:
     American Stock Transfer & Trust
     Company
     PO Box 922
     Wall Street Station
     New York, NY 10269-0560

   Through the Internet:
     www.amstock.com

   Through AST's automated voice response System:
     1-888-556-0425

AST will furnish you with a copy of the Terms and Conditions of the Plan
without charge.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.
As of the end of the period  covered by this report,  The Swiss  Helvetia  Fund,
Inc.  has  adopted a code of ethics,  as defined in Item 2 of Form  N-CSR,  that
applies to its President and Treasurer. A copy of the code of ethics is filed as
an exhibit to this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE  FINANCIAL EXPERT.  The Registrant's  Board of Directors
(the "Board") has determined that Messrs. Didier  Pineau-Valencienne  and Samuel
B. Witt, III, Esq., each a member of the audit committee of the Board, are audit
committee financial experts as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  "SEC").  Messrs.  Pineau-Valencienne  and Witt each are  "independent"  as
defined  by  the  SEC  for  purposes  of  audit   committee   financial   expert
determinations.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.
(a) The  aggregate  fees  billed  for  each of the last two  fiscal  years  (the
"Reporting  Periods") for  professional  services  rendered by the  Registrant's
principal  accountant  for  the  audit  of  the  Registrant's  annual  financial
statements,  or services that are normally provided by the principal  accountant
in connection  with the statutory and regulatory  filings or engagements for the
Reporting Periods, were $34,500 in 2003 and $36,000 in 2004.

(b) There were no  audit-related  fees billed to the Registrant in the Reporting
Periods for assurance and related services rendered by the principal  accountant
that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Registrant's
financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this Item 4.

There were no fees billed in the  Reporting  Periods for  assurance  and related
services  rendered by the principal  accountant to the  Registrant's  investment
adviser and any entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common control with
the  investment  adviser  that  provides  ongoing  services  to  the  Registrant
(collectively  the "investment  adviser") which were required to be pre-approved
by the audit committee as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this Item 4.

(c) The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods for professional services
rendered by the principal  accountant to the Registrant for tax compliance,  tax
advice and tax planning ("Tax Services") were $4,000 in 2003 and $4,000 in 2004.
These services consisted of review or preparation of U.S. federal,  state, local
and excise tax returns.

(d) The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods for products and services
provided by the principal accountant to the Registrant,  other than the services
reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item, were $17,600 in 2003 and $0
in  2004.  These  services  related  to  work  performed  for  internal  control
consulting services.

(e) (1) The Registrant's Audit Committee pre-approves the principal accountant's
engagements  for audit and  non-audit  services to the  Registrant,  and certain
non-audit   services  to  the  investment   adviser  that  are  required  to  be
pre-approved  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Pre-approval  considerations  include
whether the proposed  services are  compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
accountant's independence.

(e) (2) No  services  included  in (b) - (d) above  were  approved  pursuant  to
paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

(f) None.

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the principal accountant for services
rendered to the  Registrant  for the Reporting  Periods were $21,600 in 2003 and
$4,000 in 2004.  There were no fees billed in each of the Reporting  Periods for
non-audit  services  rendered  by the  principal  accountant  to the  investment
adviser.

<PAGE>


(h) The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of any
non-audit   services   rendered  to  the  investment   adviser  which  were  not
pre-approved  (not requiring  pre-approval)  is compatible with  maintaining the
principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.
The Registrant has a separately-designated  standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section  3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,

"interested person" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "Act"):

Didier Pineau-Valencienne
Claude Mosseri-Marlio
Samuel B. Witt, III, Esq.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.
Not Applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.
The Registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio  holdings
to its investment adviser,  Hottinger Capital Corp. (the "Advisor"), to vote the
Registrant's  proxies in accordance with Advisor's  proxy voting  guidelines and
procedures.  The  Advisor has  adopted  proxy  voting  guidelines  (the  "Voting
Guidelines") that provide as follows:

     o    The Advisor votes  proxies in respect of a client's  securities in the
          client's best economic  interests and without  regard to the interests
          of the Advisor or any other client of the Advisor.

     o    Unless  the  Advisor's  Proxy  Voting   Committee  (the   "Committee")
          otherwise  determines (and documents the basis for its decision) or as
          otherwise  provided  below,  the  Advisor  votes  proxies  in a manner
          consistent with the Voting Guidelines.

     o    To avoid  material  conflicts  of  interest,  the Advisor  applies the
          Voting  Guidelines in an objective and consistent manner across client
          accounts.  Where a material  conflict of interest has been  identified
          and the  matter is covered by the  Voting  Guidelines,  the  Committee
          votes in accordance  with the Voting  Guidelines.  Where a conflict of
          interest  has been  identified  and the  matter is not  covered by the
          Voting  Guidelines,  the Advisor  will  disclose  the conflict and the
          Committee's  determination  of the  manner  in  which  to  vote to the
          Registrant's Audit Committee.

     o    The  Advisor  also may  determine  not to vote  proxies  in respect of
          securities  of any  issuer  if it  determines  that it would be in the
          client's overall best interests not to vote.

The Advisor's Voting  Guidelines  address how it will vote proxies on particular
types of matters such as the election  for  directors,  adoption of option plans
and anti-takeover proposals. For example, the Advisor generally will:

     o    support  management in most elections for directors,  unless the board
          gives  evidence of acting  contrary to the best economic  interests of
          shareholders;

     o    support  option  plans,  if it  believes  that they  provide for their
          administration  by  disinterested  parties  and provide  incentive  to
          directors,  managers and other  employees by aligning  their  economic
          interests with those of the  shareholders  while limiting the transfer
          of wealth out of the company; and

     o    oppose  anti-takeover  proposals  unless they are structured in such a
          way that they give  shareholders the ultimate decision on any proposal
          or offer.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
The Registrant has a Nominating  Committee,  which is responsible  for selecting

be considered by the Nominating  Committee,  including  character and integrity;

                          THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code") for The Swiss  Helvetia  Fund,  Inc.  (the
"Fund")  applies  to  the  Fund's  Principal  Executive  Officer  and  Principal
Financial Officer,  or other persons performing similar functions,  each of whom
is listed on Exhibit A (the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high standard of business  ethics
and should be  sensitive to  situations  that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE  ETHICALLY  ACTUAL AND APPARENT  CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST


     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his service to, the Fund.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  "Investment
Company  Act"),  and the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  as  amended  (the
"Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain  transactions  (such as the purchase or sale of  securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund.  The  compliance  programs and  procedures  of the Fund and the Fund's
investment  advisor (the  "Advisor")  are  designed to prevent,  or identify and
correct,  violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures.


<PAGE>


     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the Fund and the Advisor of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary  course  of  their  duties  (whether  formally  for the Fund or for the
Advisor,   or  for  both),  will  be  involved  in  establishing   policies  and
implementing  decisions that will have different  effects on the Advisor and the
Fund. The  participation  of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the  contractual  relationship  between  the  Fund  and  the  Advisor  and is
consistent  with the  performance  by the Covered  Officers  of their  duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity  with the provisions of the
Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers  Act.  Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that the Code
cannot enumerate every possible scenario.  The overarching principle of the Code
is that  the  personal  interest  of a  Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not cause the Fund to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the
          individual  personal  benefit of the Covered  Officer  rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

     o    not retaliate  against any employee or Covered  Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    Each Covered  Officer should  familiarize  himself with the disclosure
          requirements   and  disclosure   controls  and  procedures   generally
          applicable to the Fund within his area of responsibility;

     o    each  Covered  Officer  should not  knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or  outside  the Fund,  including  to the  Fund's  Board  members  and
          auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators  and   self-regulatory
          organizations; and

     o    to the  extent  appropriate  within his area of  responsibility,  each
          Covered  Officer  should  consult with other officers and employees of
          the Fund and the  Advisor  and take other  appropriate  steps with the
          goal of promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable
          disclosure  in the  reports  and  documents  the Fund files  with,  or
          submits  to, the SEC and in other  public  communications  made by the
          Fund; and

                                       2

<PAGE>


     o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon becoming
          a  Covered  Officer),  affirm  in  writing  to the  Board  that he has
          received, read, and understands the Code;

     o    annually  thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code; and

     o    notify the Audit Committee (the  "Committee")  promptly if he knows of
          any  violation of the Code.  Failure to do so is itself a violation of
          the Code.

     The Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  applying  the Code to  specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any  particular  situation and to grant waivers  sought by
any Covered Officer.  The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing the Code:

     o    the Committee  will take all  appropriate  action to  investigate  any
          potential violations reported to it;

     o    if, after such investigation, the Committee believes that no violation
          has  occurred,  the  Committee  is not  required  to take any  further
          action;

     o    if the Committee  determines  that a violation  has occurred,  it will
          inform and make a  recommendation  to the Board,  which will  consider
          appropriate  action,  which may  include  review of,  and  appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;  notification to
          appropriate personnel of the Advisor or its board; or a recommendation
          to dismiss the Covered Officer; and

     o    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required, will
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     The Code shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the Fund for purposes
of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  and the  rules  and  forms
applicable  to  registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar as other
policies and  procedures  of the Fund,  the Advisor or other  service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are subject to the Code,  they are superceded by the Code to the extent that
they overlap or conflict  with the  provisions  of the Code.  The Fund's and the
Advisor's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment  Company Act and
the  Advisor's  additional  policies and  procedures  are separate  requirements
applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

                                       3

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Except as to Exhibit A, the Code may not be amended except in written form,
which is  specifically  approved or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the Fund's
Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will be
considered  confidential  and shall be  maintained  and  protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required  by law or the Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed  to  anyone  other  than the  Fund  and its  counsel,  the  Board  (or
Committees thereof) and its counsel, and the Advisor.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
