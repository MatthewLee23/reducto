The India Fund, Inc.

                                                               February 18, 2005


DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to provide you with the audited financial statements of The India
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") closed at $28.47 on December 31, 2004,
representing an increase of 26.22% (after taking the Fund's dividends into
account) from the Fund's NAV on December 31, 2003 which was $23.76. The Fund
outperformed its benchmark, returning 26.22% versus the IFC Investable Index,
which gained 22.84% during the same period.*

The Indian stock market finished 2004 as one of the top performers in Asia
despite fears that the newly elected government would not last a full term and
would shelve the economic reform agenda. Initial fears were mitigated by the
strong performance of the new government in state elections and the
implementation of a broader economic reform agenda. The market got a lift in the
second half of the year as investors grew more confident of the government's
commitment to accelerate growth, initiate reforms and increase infrastructure
projects. The market was also boosted by record foreign investment inflows of
over $8.5 billion for the year and record foreign exchange reserves passing the
$130 billion mark.

Looking ahead, we believe that India will benefit from favorable conditions such
as high consumer confidence, favorable liquidity, strong currency and upward
pressure on wages. We believe these factors, in addition to a growing middle
class, will continue to support domestic consumption.

Finally, following 2004's impressive second half rally, we believe valuations
may not be as compelling as they were during the past year. Nevertheless, we
strongly believe that the fundamental long-term outlook for India remains
positive.


                                                                               1

Sincerely,

/s/ Bryan McKigney

FUNDAMENTAL PERIODIC REPURCHASE POLICY

The Fund  has  adopted  the  following  fundamental  policy  regarding  periodic
repurchases:

   a) The Fund  will  make  offers  to  repurchase  its  shares  at  semi-annual
      intervals pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
      as amended from time to time ("Offers").  The Board of Directors may place
      such  conditions and  limitations on Offers as may be permitted under Rule
      23c-3.

   b) 14 days  prior to the last  Friday of the  Fund's  first and third  fiscal
      quarters,  or the next  business day if such Friday is not a business day,
      will be the deadline (the "Repurchase Request Deadline") by which the Fund
      must receive repurchase  requests submitted by stockholders in response to
      the most recent Offer.

   c) The date on which the repurchase price for shares is to be determined (the
      "Repurchase  Pricing  Date")  shall occur no later than the last Friday of
      the Fund's first and third fiscal  quarters,  or the next  business day if
      such day is not a business day.

   d) Offers may be suspended  or  postponed  under  certain  circumstances,  as
      provided for in Rule 23c-3.

THE INDIA FUND, INC.

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The India Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on December 27,
1993, and commenced operations on February 23, 1994. The Fund operates through a
branch in the Republic of Mauritius. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company  Act  of  1940,   as  amended  (the  "1940  Act"),   as  a   closed-end,
non-diversified  management  investment company. The Fund's investment objective
is  long-term  capital  appreciation  by investing  primarily  in Indian  equity
securities.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

PORTFOLIO  VALUATION.  Investments  are  stated  at  value  in the  accompanying
financial  statements.  All securities  for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at:

     (i)   the last sales price prior to the time of determination, if there was
           a sale on the date of determination,

     (ii)  at the mean between the last current bid and asked  prices,  if there
           was no sales  price on such  date and bid and  asked  quotations  are
           available, and

     (iii) at the bid  price if there  was no sales  price on such date and only
           bid quotations are available.

Securities  that  are  traded  over-the-counter  are  valued,  if bid and  asked
quotations are available,  at the mean between the current bid and asked prices.
Securities for which sales prices and bid and asked quotations are not available
on the date of determination may be valued at the most recently available prices
or quotations under policies  adopted by the Board of Directors.  Investments in
short-term  debt  securities  having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized  cost which  approximates  market value.  Securities  for which market
values are not readily  ascertainable are carried at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors.  The net asset
value per share of the Fund is calculated weekly and at the end of each month.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME.  Investment  transactions  are
accounted for on the trade date. The cost of  investments  sold is determined by
use of the  specific  identification  method for both  financial  reporting  and
income tax reporting purposes. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis;
dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date or,  using  reasonable
diligence,  when known.  The  collectibility  of income  receivable  from Indian
securities  is  evaluated   periodically,   and  any  resulting  allowances  for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.

TAX STATUS.  No provision is made for U.S.  federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to  make  the  requisite  distributions  to its  shareholders  that  will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all federal income and excise
taxes.

Income and capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2004:

THE INDIA FUND, INC.

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

During the period ended December 31, 2004, the Fund  reclassified  $115,102 from
accumulated  net realized gains on investments to  undistributed  net investment
income as a result of permanent book and tax differences  relating  primarily to
realized   foreign   currency  gains.  Net  assets  were  not  affected  by  the
reclassifications.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S.  dollars.  Foreign  currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (i)  value  of  investment  securities,   assets  and  liabilities  at  the
          prevailing rates of exchange on the valuation date; and

     (ii) purchases and sales of investment  securities and investment income at
          the relevant rates of exchange  prevailing on the respective  dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund  generally  does not  isolate  the  effect of  fluctuations  in foreign
exchange  rates  from  the  effect  of  fluctuations  in the  market  prices  of
securities. However, the Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency  rates  when  determining  the gain or loss  upon  the sale of  foreign
currency  denominated  debt  obligations  pursuant  to U.S.  federal  income tax
regulations;  such amounts are  categorized as foreign  currency gains or losses
for federal  income tax  purposes.  The Fund reports  certain  realized  foreign
exchange  gains and  losses as  components  of  realized  gains and  losses  for
financial  reporting  purposes,  whereas  such  amounts  are treated as ordinary
income for federal income tax reporting purposes.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Foreign security
and  currency  transactions  may involve  certain  considerations  and risks not
typically  associated  with those of domestic origin as a result of, among other
factors,  the  level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of  foreign
securities markets and the possibility of political or economic instability, and
the fact that foreign  securities markets may be smaller and have less developed
and less reliable settlement and share registration procedures.

DISTRIBUTION  OF INCOME AND GAINS.  The Fund intends to  distribute  annually to
shareholders  substantially all of its net investment income,  including foreign
currency  gains,  and to  distribute  annually any net realized  gains after the
utilization of available capital loss carryovers. An additional distribution may
be made to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% federal excise tax.

Distributions to shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are  determined in accordance  with federal  income tax  regulations,  which may
differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of
America.  These  "book/tax"  differences  are  either  considered  temporary  or
permanent

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004

in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts
are reclassified  within the capital  accounts based on their federal  tax-basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.  Dividends and
distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for  financial  reporting  purposes  but not for tax  purposes  are  reported as
dividends in excess of net investment  income and net realized capital gains. To
the extent  they exceed net  investment  income and net  realized  gains for tax
purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in capital.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


On January 3, 2003,  Oppenheimer  acquired the U.S.  brokerage  business of CIBC
World Markets Corp. ("CIBC WM").  Oppenheimer also acquired CIBC WM's U.S. asset
management  business.  The  acquisition  was  completed  on  June  4,  2003.  In
connection  with the  June 4,  2003  acquisition,  a new  investment  management
agreement and country advisory agreement dated June 4, 2003 was executed, having
been  previously  approved by the Board of  Directors  of the Fund,  including a
majority of the  independent  Directors at a special meeting held on January 17,
2003 and by the  stockholders  of the Fund at the Fund's  April 23,  2003 annual
meeting of stockholders, as required by the 1940 Act.

The Fund pays each of its directors  who is not a director,  officer or employee
of the  Investment  Manager,  the Country  Adviser or the  Administrator  or any
affiliate  thereof  an annual  fee of $5,000  plus up to $700 for each  Board of
Directors meeting attended.  In addition,  the Fund reimburses all directors for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board of Directors
meetings.

NOTE C: PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term obligations, aggregated
$191,802,958  and  $232,584,904  respectively,  for the year ended  December 31,
2004.

NOTE D: FOREIGN INCOME TAX

The Fund  conducts  its  investment  activities  in India as a tax  resident  of
Mauritius  and  expects  to obtain  benefits  under the double  taxation  treaty
between  Mauritius and India (the "tax treaty" or "treaty").  To obtain benefits
under  the  double  taxation  treaty,  the Fund  must  meet  certain  tests  and
conditions,  including the  establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related
requirements. The Fund has obtained a certificate from the Mauritian authorities
that it is a resident of  Mauritius  under the double  taxation  treaty  between
Mauritius and India. Under current  regulations,  a fund which is a tax resident
in Mauritius under the treaty,  but has no branch or permanent  establishment in
India,  will  not be  subject  to  capital  gains  tax in  India  on the sale of
securities or to tax on dividends paid by Indian companies.  The Fund is subject
to and accrues Indian withholding tax on interest earned on Indian securities at
the rate of 20.91%.

The  Fund  will,  in any year  that it has  taxable  income  for  Mauritius  tax
purposes,  elect to pay tax on its net income for  Mauritius tax purposes at any
rate between 0% and 35%.

The Fund  continues  to:  (i)  comply  with the  requirements  of the tax treaty
between  India and  Mauritius;  (ii) be a tax resident of  Mauritius;  and (iii)
maintain  that its central  management  and  control  resides in  Mauritius  and
therefore  management believes that the Fund will be able to obtain the benefits
of the tax treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  Accordingly,  no provision for
Indian income taxes has been made in  accompanying  financial  statements of the
Fund for taxes related to capital gains or dividends.

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


The foregoing is based upon current  interpretation  and practice and is subject
to future  changes in Indian or  Mauritian  tax laws and in the  treaty  between
India and Mauritius.


NOTE E: CAPITAL STOCK

In  February  2003,  the Board of  Directors  approved,  subject to  stockholder
approval,  a fundamental  policy whereby the Fund would adopt an "interval fund"
structure  pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act.  Stockholders  of the Fund
approved  the policy on April 30,  2003.  As an  interval  fund,  the Fund makes
semi-annual  repurchase  offers at net asset value (less a 2% repurchase fee) to
all Fund  stockholders.  The percentage of outstanding  shares that the Fund can
repurchase in each offer is established by the Fund's Board of Directors shortly
before the commencement of each  semi-annual  offer and is between 5% and 25% of
the Fund's then-outstanding shares.

During  the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  the  results  of the  semi-annual
repurchase offer were as follows:

NOTE F: RIGHTS OFFER

On  December  17,  2004,  the Fund  commenced  a rights  offering  and issued to
stockholders  as of December  17, 2004 one right for each share of common  stock
held. The rights were not transferable and, consequently, were not listed on any
exchange. The rights entitled holders to subscribe for an aggregate of 7,546,991
shares of the  Fund's  common  stock.  In  addition,  the Fund had the option of
issuing  additional  shares  in an  amount  up to 25% of the  shares  that  were
available in the primary offering,  or 1,886,747 shares,  for an aggregate total
of  9,433,738  shares.  The offer  expired on January  31,  2005.  The Fund sold
9,433,738 shares at the subscription price per share of $26.50 (representing 95%
of the Fund's net asset  value per share on the  expiration  date of the offer).
The  total  proceeds  of the  rights  offering  were  $249,994,057  and the Fund
incurred costs to date of $288,352.

Pursuant  to an amended  and  restated  management  agreement  that will  become
effective upon the consummation of the rights  offering,  the Fund shall pay the
Investment  Manager a monthly  fee at an annual rate of: (i) 1.10% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets up to and including $600,000,000 and (ii) 0.95% of the
Fund's average weekly net assets in excess of $600,000,000.

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONCLUDED)


NOTE G: CONCENTRATION OF RISKS

At December 31, 2004,  substantially  all of the Fund's net assets were invested
in Indian  securities.  The Indian  securities  markets are among  other  things
substantially  smaller, less developed,  less liquid, subject to less regulation
and  more  volatile  than  the   securities   markets  in  the  United   States.
Consequently,  and as further discussed above,  acquisitions and dispositions of
securities by the Fund involve special risks and considerations not present with
respect to U.S.  securities.  At December 31, 2004, the Fund has a concentration
of its investment in computer,  finance, and diversified industries.  The values
of such investments may be affected by changes in such industry sectors.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign  exchange.  Foreign security and
currency  transactions  involve certain  considerations  and risks not typically
associated  with those of domestic  origin as a result of, among other  factors,
the level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of foreign  securities
markets and the  possibilities  of political or economic  instability,  the fact
that foreign securities markets may be smaller and less developed,  and the fact
that securities,  tax and corporate laws may have only recently developed or are
in developing  stages,  and laws may not exist to cover all  contingencies or to
protect investors adequately.

In the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of  representations  and  warranties and which may provide for general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown,  as this would involve  future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, management expects the
risk of loss to be remote.



                                                                              21

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
THE INDIA FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the financial position of The India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  of these  financial  statements  in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2004 by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable  basis for
our opinion.

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS


DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute annually to shareholders substantially all of its
net investment income, and to distribute any net realized capital gains at least
annually.  Net  investment  income  for this  purpose  is income  other than net
realized long and short-term capital gains net of expenses.

Pursuant to the  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Cash  Purchase  Plan (the  "Plan"),
shareholders whose shares of Common Stock are registered in their own names will
be deemed to have elected to have all distributions  automatically reinvested by
the Plan Agent in Fund  shares  pursuant to the Plan,  unless such  shareholders
elect to  receive  distributions  in cash.  Shareholders  who  elect to  receive
distributions  in cash will receive all  distributions  in cash paid by check in
dollars mailed  directly to the shareholder by the dividend paying agent. In the
case of  shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or nominees  that hold shares for
others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the
basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the shareholders as
representing the total amount  registered in such  shareholders'  names and held
for  the  account  of  beneficial  owners  that  have  not  elected  to  receive
distributions  in cash.  Investors  that own shares  registered in the name of a
bank,   broker  or  other  nominee  should  consult  with  such  nominee  as  to
participation  in the Plan  through  such  nominee,  and may be required to have
their shares registered in their own names in order to participate in the Plan.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in  administering  the Plan.
If the  directors  of the Fund  declare an income  dividend  or a capital  gains
distribution   payable   either  in  the  Fund's   Common   Stock  or  in  cash,
nonparticipants  in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund or purchased by the Plan Agent in
the open  market,  as  provided  below.  If the  market  price  per share on the
valuation  date equals or exceeds  net asset  value per share on that date,  the
Fund  will  issue new  shares to  participants  at net  asset  value;  provided,
however,  that if the net asset  value is less than 95% of the  market  price on
valuation date, then such shares will be issued at 95% of the market price.  The
valuation  date will be the  dividend or  distribution  payment date or, if that
date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the next  preceding  trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time, or
if the Fund  should  declare an income  dividend or capital  gains  distribution
payable only in cash,  the Plan Agent will, as agent for the  participants,  buy
Fund shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for
the  participants'  accounts on, or shortly after,  the payment date. If, before
the Plan Agent has  completed  its  purchases,  the market price exceeds the net
asset value of a Fund share,  the average per share  purchase  price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition  of fewer  shares than if the  distribution  had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund on the dividend payment date.


                                                                              27

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONTINUED)


DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Because of the forgoing  difficulty with respect to open market  purchases,  the
Plan  provides  that if the Plan  Agent is unable to  invest  the full  dividend
amount in  open-market  purchases  during the  purchase  period or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase  period,  the Plan Agent
will cease  making  open-market  purchases  and  shareholders  will  receive the
uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at the close of
business on the last purchase date.

Participants  have the option of making  additional  cash  payments  to the Plan
Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for investment in the Fund's
Common Stock. The Plan Agent will use all such funds received from  participants
to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about February 15.

Any voluntary cash payment received more than 30 days prior to this date will be
returned by the Plan Agent, and interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payment. To avoid unnecessary cash  accumulations,  and also to allow ample time
for receipt and processing by the Plan Agent, it is suggested that  participants
send in voluntary  cash payments to be received by the Plan Agent  approximately
ten days before an applicable  purchase date specified  above. A participant may
withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written  notice,  if the notice is received
by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Agent  maintains  all  shareholder  accounts in the Plan and  furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in an account,  including information
needed by  shareholders  for personal and tax records.  Shares in the account of
each  Plan  participant  will be  held  by the  Plan  Agent  in the  name of the
participant,  and each  shareholder's  proxy will include those shares purchased
pursuant to the Plan.

There is no charge to participants  for  reinvesting  dividends or capital gains
distributions  or  voluntary  cash  payments.  The  Plan  Agent's  fees  for the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments  will be paid by the Fund.  There  will be no  brokerage  charges  with
respect  to  shares  issued  directly  by the Fund as a result of  dividends  or
capital gains distributions  payable either in stock or in cash.  However,  each
participant  will pay a pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred  with
respect  to the  Plan  Agent's  open-market  purchases  in  connection  with the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments made by the participant. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual  accounts  through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such  transactions,  because the Plan Agent will
be  purchasing  stock for all  participants  in blocks and  prorating  the lower
commissions thus attainable.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONCLUDED)


DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The  receipt of  dividends  and  distributions  under the Plan will not  relieve
participants  of any  income  tax  that  may be  payable  on such  dividends  or
distributions.

Experience  under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are  desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent  to notice of the  termination  sent to  members of the Plan at
least 30 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or
appropriate  to comply with  applicable  law,  rules or policies of a regulatory
authority) only by at least 30 days' written notice to participants in the Plan.
All  correspondence  concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
P.O. Box 43027, Westborough, Massachusetts 43027.

                      AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES

                         As adopted on October 26, 2004

         The Audit Committee (the "Committee") of each of The Asia Tigers Fund,
Inc. and The India Fund, Inc. (each, a "Fund") must pre-approve any independent
accounting firm's engagement to render audit and/or permissible non-audit
(including audit-related) services, as required by law. In evaluating a proposed
engagement by the Fund's independent accountants, the Committee will evaluate
the effect that the engagement might reasonably be expected to have on the
accountant's independence. That evaluation will be based on several factors,
including:

            o  a review of the nature of the professional services expected to
               be provided;

            o  the fees to be charged in connection with the services expected
               to be provided;

            o  a review of the safeguards put into place by the accounting firm
               to safeguard independence; and

            o  periodic meetings with the accounting firm.

I.       POLICY FOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FUND
         ------------------------------------------------------------------

         On an annual basis, the Fund's Committee will review and pre-approve
the scope of the audits of the Fund and proposed audit fees and permitted
non-audit services that may be performed by the Fund's independent accountants.
At least annually, the Committee will receive a report of all audit and
non-audit services that were rendered in the previous calendar year pursuant to
this policy. The term of any pre-approval is twelve months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Committee specifically provides otherwise. The
Committee may modify any pre-approval at its discretion. Fee levels for all
services pre-approved under this policy will be established annually by the
Committee.

         In addition to the Committee's pre-approval of services pursuant to
this policy, the engagement of the independent accounting firm for any permitted
non-audit service provided to the Fund will also require the separate written
pre-approval of the President of the Fund, who will independently confirm that
the accounting firm's engagement will not adversely affect the firm's
independence. All non-audit services performed by the independent accounting
firm will be disclosed, as required, in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC").

         A.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The categories of audit services and related fees to be reviewed and

may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting firm's
independence, by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a

             during the fiscal year in which such services are provided and (ii)
             with respect to such services provided to Service Affiliates, five
             percent (5%) of the total amount of revenues paid to the Fund's
             independent accountant by the Fund and the Service Affiliates

         (2) Such services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the
             engagement for such services to be non-audit services; and

             Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the
             Committee or by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee
             member who is a disinterested director under the Investment Company
             Act to whom this responsibility has been delegated). Any approval
             by the Committee Chairman or other delegate shall be reported to
             the full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

     (e)(2)  The  percentage of services  described in each of  paragraphs  (b)
             through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
             pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
             are as follows:

                           (b) N/A

                           (c) 100%

<PAGE>

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

                                  INTRODUCTION
                                  ------------

Rule 206(4)-6 (the "Rule") adopted under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Advisers Act") requires all registered investment advisers that
exercise voting discretion over securities held in client portfolios to adopt
proxy voting policies and procedures.

Advantage Advisers, Inc., (the "Adviser") is a registered investment adviser
under the Advisers Act and is therefore required to adopt proxy voting policies
and procedures pursuant to the Rule.

When the Adviser has investment discretion over a client's investment portfolio,
then the Adviser votes proxies for the Account pursuant to the policies and
procedures set forth herein.

                           VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES
                           ---------------------------
                            IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS
                            ------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder votes for persons who have been nominated by a
corporation's board of directors to stand for election to serve as members of
that board. No candidates are opposing these board nominees.

In each analysis of an uncontested election of directors you should review:

     a) Company performance
     b) Composition of the board and key board committees
     c) Attendance at board meetings
     d) Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity

We may also consider:

     a) Board decisions concerning executive compensation
     b) Number of other board seats held by the nominee
     c) Interlocking directorships

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     It is our policy to vote IN
                                                     FAVOR of the candidates
                                                     proposed by the board.

We will look carefully at each candidate's background contained in the proxy
statement. In the absence of unusual circumstances suggesting a nominee is
clearly not qualified to serve as a member of the board, we will vote with
management.

                      CHAIRMAN AND CEO ARE THE SAME PERSON
                      ------------------------------------

Shareholders may propose that different persons hold the positions of the
chairman and the CEO.

We would evaluate these proposals on a case by case basis depending on the size
of the company and performance of management.

                            INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
                            -------------------------

     Shareholders may request that the board be comprised of a majority of
     independent directors and that audit, compensation and nominating
     committees of the Board consists exclusively of independent directors. We
     believe that independent directors are important to corporate governance.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     It is our policy to vote
                                                     FOR proposals requesting
                                                     that a majority of the
                                                     Board be independent and
                                                     that the audit,
                                                     compensation and nominating
                                                     committees of the board
                                                     include only independent
                                                     directors.

                          STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
                          ----------------------------

     Shareholders may propose that directors be required to own a minimum amount
     of company stock or that directors should be paid in company stock, not
     cash. This proposal is based on the view that directors will align
     themselves with the interest of shareholders if they are shareholders
     themselves. We believe that directors are required to exercise their
     fiduciary duty to the company and its shareholders whether or not they own
     shares in the company and should be allowed to invest in company stock
     based on their own personal considerations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals that
                                                     require director stock
                                                     ownership.

                            CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
                            ------------------------

     Charitable contributions by companies are generally useful for assisting
     worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill between the company and its
     community. Moreover, there may be certain long-term financial benefits to
     companies from certain charitable contributions generated from, for
     example, movies spent helping educational efforts in the firm's primary
     employment areas. Shareholders should not decide what the most worthwhile
     charities are.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     (Shareholders Proposals)
                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals
                                                     regarding charitable
                                                     contribution.

     Shareholders have differing and equally sincere views as to which charities
     the company should contribute to, and the amount it should contribute. In
     the absence of bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management
     should determine which contributions are in the best interest of the
     company.

                      DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
                      ------------------------------------
                            AND LIABILITY PROTECTION
                            ------------------------

     These proposals typically provide for protection (or additional protection)
     which is to be afforded to the directors of a corporation in the form of
     indemnification by the corporation, insurance coverage or limitations upon
     their liability in connection with their responsibilities as directors.

     When a corporation indemnifies its directors and officers, it means the
     corporation promises to reimburse them for certain legal expenses, damages,
     and judgements incurred as a result of lawsuits relating to their corporate
     actions. The corporation becomes the insurer for its officers and
     directors.

                                                     beyond just legal expenses
                                                     to acts, such as
                                                     negligence, that are more
                                                     serious violations of
                                                     fiduciary obligations than
                                                     mere carelessness.

                                                     Vote FOR only those
                                                     proposals providing such
                                                     expanded coverage in cases
                                                     when a director's or
                                                     officer's legal defense was
                                                     unsuccessful if: a) the
                                                     director was found to have
                                                     acted in good faith, and b)
                                                     only if the director's
                                                     legal expenses would be
                                                     covered.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The present environment in which directors operate provides substantial
        risk of claims or suits against them in their individual capacities
        arising out of the discharge of their duties.

     2. Attracting and retaining the most qualified directors enhances
        shareholder value.

                                SIZE OF THE BOARD
                                -----------------

     Typically there are three reasons for changing the size of the board. The
     first reason may be to permit inclusion into the board of additional
     individuals who, by virtue of their ability and experience, would benefit
     the corporation. The second reason may be to reduce the size of the board
     due to expiration of terms, resignation of sitting directors or, thirdly,
     to accommodate the corporation's changing needs.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote FOR the board's
                                                     recommendation to increase
                                                     or decrease the size of the
                                                     board.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. These proposals may aim at reducing or increasing the influence of
        certain groups of individuals.

     2. This is an issue with which the board of directors is uniquely qualified
        to deal, since they have the most experience in sitting on a board and
        are up-to-date on the specific needs of the corporation.

               VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS
               --------------------------------------------------

Votes in contested elections of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

The following factors are considered:

     1. management's track record

     2. background to the proxy contest

     3. qualifications of director nominees

                                 --------------

This is a shareholder's proposal to limit the tenure of outside directors. This
requirement may not be an appropriate one. It is an artificial imposition on the
board, and may have the result of removing knowledgeable directors from the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote AGAINST shareholder
                                                     proposals to limit the
                                                     tenure of outside
                                                     directors.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. An experienced director should not be disqualified because he or she has
        served a certain number of years.

     2. The nominating committee is in the best position to judge the directors'
        terms in office due to their understanding of a corporation's needs and
        a director's abilities and experience.

     3. If shareholders are not satisfied with the job a director is doing, they
        can vote him/her off the board when the term is up.

                             COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE
                             -----------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval of a request that the board of
directors disclose the amount of compensation paid to officers and employees, in
addition to the disclosure of such information in the proxy statement as
required by the SEC regulations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     (shareholders policy)

                                                     disclosure, unless we have
                                                     reason to believe that
                                                     mandated disclosures are
                                                     insufficient to give an
                                                     accurate and meaningful
                                                     account of senior
                                                     management compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Federal securities laws require disclosure in corporate proxy statements
        of the compensation paid to corporate directors and officers.

     2. Employees other than executive officers and directors are typically not
        in policy-making roles where they have the ability to determine, in a
        significant way, the amount of their own compensation.

     3. The disclosure of compensation of lower-level officers and employees
        infringes upon their privacy and might create morale problems.

                               ------------------

Shareholders must make certain that auditors are responsibly examining the
financial statements of a company, that their reports adequately express any
legitimate financial concerns, and that the auditor is independent of the
company it is serving.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote FOR proposal to ratify
                                                     auditors.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Although lawsuits are sometimes filed against accounting firms,
        including those nationally recognized, these firms typically complete
        their assignments in a lawful and professional manner.

     2. Sometimes it may be appropriate for a corporation to change accounting
        firms, but the board of directors is in the best position to judge the
        advantages of any such change and any disagreements with former auditors
        must be fully disclosed to shareholders.

     3. If there is a reason to believe the independent auditor has rendered an
        opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
        financial position, then in this case vote AGAINST ratification.

                                  ------------

Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by
potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: a) dilute the acquirer's
equity in the target company, b) dilute the acquirer's voting interests in the
target company, or c) dilute the acquirer's equity holdings in the post-merger
company. Generally, poison pills accomplish these tasks by issuing rights or
warrants to shareholders that are essentially worthless unless triggered by a
hostile acquisition attempt.

A poison pill should contain a redemption clause that would allow the board to
redeem it even after a potential acquirer has surpassed the ownership threshold.
Poison pills may be adopted by the board without shareholder approval. But
shareholders must have the opportunity to ratify or reject them at least every
two years.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                    GREENMAIL
                                    ---------

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the
market, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Greenmail payments usually expose the company to negative press and may result
in lawsuits by shareholders. When a company's name is associated with such a
practice, company customers may think twice about future purchases made at the
expense of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote FOR proposals to adopt

                                                     anti-Greenmail proposals
                                                     when they are bundled with
                                                     other charter or bylaw
                                                     amendments.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. While studies by the SEC and others show that Greenmail devalues the
        company's stock price, an argument can be made that a payment can enable
        the company to pursue plans that may provide long-term gains to the
        shareholders.

                               SUPERMAJORITY VOTE
                               ------------------

Supermajority provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change regarding a company and
its corporate governance provisions. These proposals seek shareholder approval
to exceed the normal level of shareholder participation and approval from a
simple majority of the outstanding shares to a much higher percentage.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                                     Vote AGAINST management

                                                     other significant business
                                                     combinations.

                                                     Vote FOR shareholder

                                                     requirements for mergers
                                                     and other significant
                                                     business combinations.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Supermajority requirements ensure broad agreement on issues that may
        have a significant impact on the future of the company.

     2. Supermajority vote may make action all but impossible.

     3. Supermajority requirements are counter to the principle of majority
        rule.

                             CHANGING CORPORATE NAME
                             -----------------------

This proposal seeks shareholder approval to change the corporation's name. It is
probably better to vote for the proposed name change before management goes back
to the drawing board and spends another small fortune attempting again to change
the name.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote FOR changing the
                                                     corporate name.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. A name of a corporation symbolizes its substance.

     2. There are many reasons a corporation may have for changing its name,
        including an intention to change the direction of the business or to
        have a contemporary corporate image.

     3. The board of directors is well-positioned to determine the best name for
        the corporation because, among other reasons, it usually seeks
        professional advice on such matters.

                                 ---------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to change the state in which a company
is incorporated. Sometimes this is done to accommodate the company's most active
operations or headquarters. More often, however, the companies want to
reincorporate in a state with more stringent anti-takeover provisions.
Delaware's state laws, for instance, including liability and anti-takeover
provisions, are more favorable to corporations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE
                                                     basis, carefully reviewing
                                                     the new state's laws and
                                                     any significant changes the
                                                     company makes in its
                                                     charter and by-laws.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The board is in the best position to determine the company's need to
        incorporate.

     2. Reincorporation may have considerable implications for shareholders,
        affecting a company's takeover defenses, its corporate structure or
        governance features.

     3. Reincorporation in a state with stronger anti-takeover laws may harm
        shareholder value.

                 BOARD STRUCTURE: STAGGERED VS. ANNUAL ELECTIONS
                 -----------------------------------------------

A company that has a classified, or staggered, board is one in which directors
are typically divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year
terms; each class's reelection occurs in different years. In contrast, all
directors of an annually elected board serve one year and the entire board
stands for election each year.

Classifying the board makes it more difficult to change control of a company
through a proxy contest involving election of directors. Because only a minority
of the directors are elected each year, it will be more difficult to win control
of the board in a single election.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals to
                                                     classify the board. Vote
                                                     FOR proposals to repeal
                                                     classified boards and to
                                                     elect all directors
                                                     annually.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The annual election of directors provides an extra check on management's
        performance. A director who is doing a good job should not fear an
        annual review of his/her directorship.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING
                                -----------------

Most companies provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each
share owned, the so-called "one share, one vote" standard. This proposal seeks
to allow each shareholder to cast votes in the election of directors
proportionate to the number of directors times the number of shares owned by
each shareholder for one nominee.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals that
                                                     permit cumulative voting.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Cumulative voting would allow a minority owner to create an impact
        disproportionate to his/her holdings.

     2. Cumulative voting can be used to elect a director who would represent
        special interests and not those of the corporation and its shareholders.

     3. Cumulative voting can allow a minority to have representation.

     4. Cumulative Voting can lead to a conflict within the board which could
        interfere with its ability to serve the shareholders' best interests.

                  SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING

when they want to take action on certain matters that arise between regularly
scheduled annual meetings.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals to

                                                     special meetings.

                                                     Vote FOR proposals that
                                                     remove restrictions on the
                                                     right of shareholders to
                                                     act independently of
                                                     management.

                SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO ALTER SIZE OF THE BOARD
                ------------------------------------------------

Proposals which would allow management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion are often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholders should support management proposals to fix the size of the board at
a specific number of directors, preventing management from increasing the size
of the board without shareholder approval. By increasing the size of the board,
management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                                     Vote FOR proposal which

                                                     which give management the
                                                     ability to alter the size
                                                     of the board without
                                                     shareholder approval.

                               CONFIDENTIAL VOTING
                               -------------------

Confidential voting, also known as voting by secret ballot, is one of the key
structural issues in the proxy system. All proxies, ballots, and voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                                     Vote FOR shareholder
                                                     proposals requesting that
                                                     corporations adopt
                                                     confidential voting.

                                                     Vote FOR management
                                                     proposals to adopt
                                                     confidential voting.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Some shareholders elect to have the board not know how they voted on
        certain issues.

     2. Should the board be aware of how a shareholder voted, the board could
        attempt to influence the shareholder to change his/her vote, giving
        itself an advantage over those that do not have access to this
        information.

     3. Confidential voting is an important element of corporate democracy which
        should be available to the shareholder.

                         SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES
                         -------------------------------

These proposals request that the corporation establish a shareholder advisory

budget funded by the corporation and would be composed of salaried committee
members with authority to hire outside experts and to include reports in the
annual proxy statement.

                                                     advisory committee.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Directors already have fiduciary responsibility to represent
        shareholders and are accountable to them by law, thus rendering
        shareholder advisory committees unnecessary.

     2. Adding another layer to the current corporate governance system would be
        expensive and unproductive.

                            -------------------------

These proposals are usually submitted by companies incorporated outside of the
United States seeking shareholder approval for actions which are considered
ordinary business and do not require shareholder approval in the United States
(i.e., declaration of dividends, approval of financial statements, etc.).

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote FOR proposals that

                                                     United States.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The laws and regulations of various countries differ widely as to those
        issues on which shareholder approval is needed, usually requiring
        consent for actions which are considered routine in the United States.

     2. The board of directors is well positioned to determine whether or not
        these types of actions are in the best interest of the corporation's
        shareholders.

                             GOVERNMENT SERVICE LIST
                             -----------------------

This proposal requests that the board of directors prepare a list of employees
or consultants to the company who have been employed by the government within a
specified period of time and the substance of their involvement.

Solicitation of customers and negotiation of contractual or other business
relationships is traditionally the responsibility of management. Compilation of
such a list does not seem to serve a useful purpose, primarily because existing
laws and regulations serve as a checklist on conflicts of interest.

                                                     been employed by the
                                                     government.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. For certain companies, employing individuals familiar with the
        regulatory agencies and procedures is essential and, therefore, is in
        the best interests of the shareholders.

     2. Existing laws and regulations require enough disclosure and serve as a
        check on conflicts of interest.

     3. Additional disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of such
        individual's privacy.

CERES proposals ask management to sign or report on process toward compliance
with ten principles committing the company to environmental stewardship.
Principle 10 directs companies to fill out the CERES report. This report
requires companies to disclose information about environmental policies, toxic
emissions, hazardous waste management, workplace safety, energy use, and
environmental audits.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. We do not believe a concrete business case is made for this proposal. In
        our opinion, the company will be best served by continuing to carry on
        its business as it did before the proposal was made.

                              ---------------------

It is well documented that Northern Ireland's Catholic community faces much
higher unemployment figures then the Protestant community. Most proposals ask
companies to endorse or report on progress with respect to the MacBride
Principles.

In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, you must decide if
the principles will cause the company to divest, and worsen unemployment
problems.

The following factors should be considered:

Proposals in this area generally request companies to report on or to adopt
certain principles regarding their operations in foreign countries.

The Maquiladora Standards are a set of guidelines that outline how U.S.
companies should conduct operations in Maquiladora facilities just across the
U.S.-Mexican border. These standards cover such topics as community development,
environmental policies, health and safety policies, and fair employment

In regards to equal employment and discrimination, companies without

        issues are already subject to significant state and federal regulations.

                           --------------------------

The ability to increase the number of authorized shares could accommodate the
sale of equity, stock splits, dividends, compensation-based plans, etc. The
board can usually be trusted to use additional shares for capital-raising and
other transactions that are in the corporation's best interests.

However, excessive escalation in the number of authorized shares may allow the
board to radically change the corporation's direction without shareholder
approval. Be careful to view that the increased number of shares will not enable
the company to activate a poison pill.

     1. Is this company going to make frequent business acquisitions over a

     2. Is the company expanding its operations?

     3. Within the company, are there any debt structuring or prepackaged
        bankruptcy plans?

                           ---------------------------

The terms of blank check preferred stock give the board of directors the power
to issue shares of preferred stock at their discretion, with voting, conversion,
distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of the
issue.

Blank check preferred stock can provide corporations with the flexibility to
meet changing financial conditions. However, once the blank check preferred
stock has been authorized, the shareholders have no further power over how or
when it will be allocated.

                                -----------------

These proposals request that the corporation provide existing shareholders with
an opportunity to acquire additional shares in proportion to their existing
holdings whenever new shares are issued. In companies with a large shareholder
base and ease in which shareholders could preserve their relative interest
through purchases of shares on the open market, the cost of implementing
preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The existence of preemptive rights can considerably slow down the
        process of issuing new shares due to the logistics involved in
        protecting such rights.

     2. Preemptive rights are not necessary for the shareholder in today's
        corporations, whose stock is held by a wide range of owners and is, in
        most cases, highly liquid.

                    ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK
                    ----------------------------------------

The purpose of par value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility of
stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. It represents the
maximum amount that a shareholder must pay the corporation if the stock is to be
fully paid when issued.

The corporation requests permission to reduce the par value of its stock. In
most cases, adjusting par value is a routine financing decision and should be
supported.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. State laws sometimes prohibit issuance of new stock priced below that of
        the outstanding shares.

     2. A corporation may be unable to raise capital if the par value is
        overstated.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing shareholders be
        reduced and how extreme will dilution to future earnings be?

     2. Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change of control
        of the company?

     3. Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in severe
        losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the debt
        restructuring?

                              ---------------------

Directors represent shareholders and are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests. Companies state in the proxy material that they pay directors well in
order to attract the most qualified candidates. All compensation packages for
any executive, director or employee should include a pay-for-performance
component.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

The following factors should be considered:

     1. As directors take an increasingly active role in corporate
        decision-making and governance, their compensation is becoming more
        performance-based.

            SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY
            --------------------------------------------------------

Shareholder compensation proposals that set limits or reduce executive
compensation should be closely scrutinized. Many of these proposals may be
flawed in their emphasis on an absolute dollar figure in compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. Executive compensation is established by a committee that consists of
        independent directors who have fiduciary responsibility to act in the
        best interest of the shareholders and who are best placed to make
        compensation decisions.

                     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)
                     --------------------------------------

These proposals ask for stockholder endorsement of compensation plans for key
employees which involve the issuance of company shares by granting of stock
options, SARs, restricted stock, etc. These plans help attract and retain
best-qualified corporate personnel and tie their interests more closely to those
of the shareholders.

     1. The exercise price for stock options is less than 85% of fair market
        value on the date of the grant.

     2. It is an omnibus stock plan which gives directors broad discretion in
        deciding how much and what kind of stock to award, when and to whom.

     3. The shares for issue exceed 8% of the company's outstanding shares; or,
        in the case of the evergreen plans, the amount of increase exceeds 1.5%
        of the total number of shares outstanding.

                                -----------------

Golden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a change in control. The change in control agreement will specify the
exact payments to be made under the golden parachutes. The calculation for
payout is usually based on some multiple of an employee's annual or monthly
compensation. Golden parachutes are generally given to employees whose annual
compensation exceeds $112,000.

Recent experience has shown a willingness of many managements to treat severance
agreements as equal to equity investments and to reward themselves as if
substantial amounts of equity were at risk.

                                                     shareholder ratification.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. The stability of management may be affected by an attempted acquisition
        of the corporation.

     2. There is a tendency on the part of an entrenched management to overstate
        the value of their continuing control of and influence on the day-to-day
        functions of a corporation.

                       CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals suggest that the board of directors solicit shareholder approval
before committing acquisitions or divestiture of a business exceeding stipulated
threshold levels. Such statutes function by denying shares their voting rights
when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals
                                                     which request the board to
                                                     seek shareholder approval
                                                     before committing to an
                                                     acquisition.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. These proposals deprive the board of directors of its ability to act
        quickly in propitious circumstances.

     2. Conforming to these requirements can be expensive.

     3. The board of directors is uniquely qualified and positioned to be able
        to make these decisions without prior shareholder approval.

     4. The threshold levels usually imposed by these proposals are much more
        stringent than required by law.

                       OPT-OUT OF STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to opt-out (not be governed by)
certain provisions of the anti-takeover laws of various states. Delaware law,
for instance, dictates that a bidder has to acquire at least 85% of a company's
stock before exercising control, unless he or she has board approval. This means
that a company may thwart an otherwise successful bidder by securing 15% of its
stock in friendly hands.

The following factors should be considered:

     1. It is the directors' responsibility to act on behalf of the shareholders
        in opposing coercive takeover attempts.

     2. Creating deterrents to corporate takeovers may allow for entrenchment of
        inefficient management.

     3. These statutes strengthen the board's ability to deal with potential
        buyers on fair and reasonable terms.

     4. Shareholders should have the final say on whether the company should be
        merged or acquired.

                                    CONFLICTS

From time to time, proxy voting proposals may raise conflicts between the
interests of the Advisers clients and the interests of the Adviser, its
affiliates and its employees. Conflicts of interest may arise when:

     1. Proxy votes regarding non-routine matters are solicited by an issuer
        that may have a separate account relationship with an affiliate of the
        Adviser or an investment banking relationship with Fahnestock & Co. Inc.

     2. A proponent of a proxy proposal has a business relationship with the
        Adviser or one of its affiliates or the Adviser or one of its affiliates
        has a business relationship with participants in proxy contests,
        corporate directors or director candidates.

     3. An employee of the Adviser has a personal interest in the outcome of a
        particular matter before shareholders.

If the Adviser receives a proxy that to the knowledge of the Proxy Manager
raises a conflict of interest, the Proxy Manager shall advise the Governance
Committee which shall determine whether the conflict is "material" to any
specific proposal involved in the proxy. The Governance Committee will determine
whether the proposal is material as follows:

     1. Routine proxy proposals are presumed not to involve a material conflict
        of interest.

     2. Non-routine proxy proposals. Proxy proposals that are "non-routine" will
        be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest unless the
        Governance Committee determines that the conflict is unrelated to the
        proposal. Non-routine proposals would include a merger, compensation
        matters for management and contested elections of directors.

CONFLICTS CONT'D
- ----------------

     3. The Governance Committee may determine on a case-by-case basis that
        particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict of
        interest because the proposal is not directly related to the Adviser's
        conflict vis-a-vis the issue. The Governance Committee will record the
        basis for any such determination. With respect to any proposal that the
        Governance Committee determines presents a material conflict of
        interest, the Adviser may vote regarding that proposal in any of the
        following ways:

              a) Obtain instructions from the client on how to vote.

              b) Use existing proxy guidelines if the policy with respect to the
                 proposal is specifically addressed and does not involve a
                 case-by-case analysis.

              c) Vote the proposal that involves the conflict according to the
                 recommendations of an independent third party such as
                 Institutional Share Services Inc. or Investor Responsibility
                 Research Center.

                                 FOREIGN PROXIES

                   SPECIAL ISSUES WITH VOTING FOREIGN PROXIES
                   ------------------------------------------

Voting proxies with respect to shares of foreign stock may involve significantly
greater effort and corresponding cost than voting proxies in the U.S domestic
market. Issues in voting foreign proxies include the following:

     1. Each country has its own rules and practices regarding shareholder
        notification, voting restrictions, registration conditions and share
        blocking.

     2. In some foreign countries shares may be "blocked" by custodian or
        depository or bearer shares deposited with specific financial
        institutions for a certain number of days before or after the
        shareholders meeting. When blocked, shares typically may not be traded
        until the day after the blocking period. Advantage may refrain from
        voting shares of foreign stocks subject to blocking restrictions where
        in the Adviser's judgment the benefit from voting the shares is
        outweighed by the interest in maintaining client liquidity in the
        shares. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis based on a
        relevant factors including the length of the blocking period, the
        significance of the holding and whether the stock is considered by a
        long-term holding.

     3. Time frames between shareholder notification, distribution of proxy
        materials, book closures and the actual meeting date may be too short to
        allow timely action.

     4. In certain countries, applicable regulations require that votes must be
        made in person at the shareholder meeting. The Adviser will weigh the
        costs and benefits of voting on proxy proposals in countries that
        require in-person voting on a case-by-case basis and make decisions on
        whether voting on a given proxy proposal is prudent. Generally, the
        Adviser will not vote shares in countries that require in person voting
        on routine matters such as uncontested elections of directors,
        ratification of auditors.

                                 --------------

Advantage will maintain the following records:

     1. Copies of these policies

     2. A copy of each proxy statement that the Adviser receives regarding
        client securities. The Adviser may satisfy this requirement by relying
        on a third party to keep copies of proxy statements provided that the
        Adviser has an undertaking from the third party to provide a copy of the
        proxy statement promptly upon request.

     3. A record of each vote cast on behalf of a client. A third party may keep
        these voting records provided that the Adviser has an undertaking from
        the third party to provide a copy of the record promptly upon request.

     4. A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to
        making a decision on how to vote proxies or that memorializes the basis
        for that decision.

     5. A copy of each written client request for information on how an Adviser
        voted proxies on behalf of the client and a copy of written response by
        the Adviser to any client request for information on how the Adviser
        voted proxies on behalf of the client.

The above records shall be maintained for five years from the end of the fiscal
year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in
an appropriate office of the Adviser.

                              AMENDED JULY 14, 2003

SECTION I         STATEMENT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES

                  This Code of Ethics (the "Code") has been adopted by Advantage
Advisers, Inc., (the "Advantage Adviser") a registered investment adviser, and
will be adopted by each of the registered investment advisers indicated on
Schedule A (each, a "Non-Advantage Adviser", and together with the Advantage
Adviser the "Advisers") in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 204A of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") and Rule 17j-1 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as applicable to the
Advisers. Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. ("OAM"), a registered investment
adviser, is the controlling person of Advantage Adviser.

                  This Code will also be adopted by the registered investment
companies listed on Schedule B, as such Schedule may be amended (each, a "Fund"
and collectively, the "Funds"), each of which has retained the Advantage Adviser
to serve as investment adviser, and, as indicated, one of the Non-Advantage
Advisers to serve as country-adviser, in order to satisfy the requirements of
Rule 17j-1 as applicable to the Funds.

                  The Code has also been adopted by Fahnestock & Co. Inc.
("Fahnestock"), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser and parent
company of the Advantage Adviser, but only with respect to those individuals who
are Fahnestock Access Persons (as defined herein).

                  As it relates to Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act, the purpose of
the Code is to establish standards and procedures that are reasonably designed
for the detection and prevention of activities by which persons having knowledge
of the investments and investment intentions of a Fund may abuse their fiduciary
duties to the Fund and otherwise to deal with the types of conflict of interest
situations to which Rule 17j-1 is addressed. As it relates to Section 204A of
the Advisers Act, the purpose of this Code is to establish procedures that,
taking into consideration the nature of each Adviser's business, are reasonably
designed to prevent the misuse of material
<PAGE>
                                                                               2

non-public information in violation of the federal securities laws by persons
associated with the Advisers.

                  The Code is based on the principle that the persons serving as
managers or officers of the Funds, persons who comprise the boards of the Funds
(the "Board Members"), and persons who are directors, partners, officers and
employees of the Advantage Adviser, Fahnestock or a Non-Advantage Adviser who
provide services to the Advantage Adviser or any Fund or who in the course of
their duties obtain information regarding investment recommendations made to any
Fund or with respect to any Fund's investment transactions, each owes a
fiduciary duty to the Fund to conduct personal securities transactions in a
manner that does not interfere with the Fund's transactions or otherwise take
unfair advantage of his or her position. All Board Members and such other
persons (collectively, "Fund Employees") are expected to adhere to this general
principle as well as to comply with all of the specific provisions of this Code
that are applicable to them; provided, however, that Fund Employees who are
associated with a Non-Advantage Adviser shall, in addition, be expected to
comply with the provisions of the code of ethics governing personal trading that
has been adopted by that Non-Advantage Adviser, as such Code may be amended
(each, a "Non-Advantage Adviser Code").

                  All Fund Employees shall place the interests of each Fund
before their own personal interests. Technical compliance with the Code will not
automatically insulate any Fund Employee from scrutiny of transactions that show
a pattern of compromise or abuse of the individual's fiduciary duties to any
Fund. Accordingly, all Fund Employees must seek to avoid any actual or potential
conflicts between their personal interests and the interests of each Fund and
its investors.

                  The provisions of this Code reflect the facts that: (1) each
Non-Advantage Adviser Code governs any proprietary transactions by such
Non-Advantage Adviser and the personal securities transactions of its associated
persons; (2) the Funds themselves have no employees; (3) the Advantage Adviser
does not engage in any proprietary trading; (4) recommendations by the Advantage
Adviser regarding the purchase or sale of investments for certain Funds are made
by persons who are directors, partners, officers or employees of a Non-Advantage
Adviser, (5) Fahnestock, a registered broker-dealer, in a control relationship
to the Advantage Adviser; and (6) Fahnestock Access Persons (as defined below),
as employees of a registered broker-dealer, are subject to additional
regulations regarding their personal trading.

                  Every Fund Employee must read and retain this Code of Ethics,
and should recognize that he or she is subject to its provisions.

SECTION II        DEFINITIONS

         or Advisory Person (as defined below); (iii) any director, partner or

         recommendation, participates in the determination of which
         recommendation will be made, or whose principal functions or duties
         relate to the determination of which recommendation will be made, or
         who, in connection with his or her duties, obtains any information
         concerning recommendations of Securities being

         ordinary course of business relate to the making of recommendations
         with respect to such purchases and sales.

         An "Advisory Person" means: (i) any employee of a Fund, Adviser or

         relate to the making of any recommendations with respect to such
         purchases or sales; and (ii) any natural person in a Control
         relationship to a Fund, Adviser or Fahnestock who obtains current
         information concerning recommendations made to a Fund with regard to
         the purchase or sale of any Security. "Current information" regarding
         investment transactions means information regarding the purchase or
         sale of investments that is received within seven (7) days before or
         after the transactions.

         "Annual Certification" means an Annual Certification of Compliance with
         Code of Ethics, in the form attached as Schedule F.

         "Beneficial Ownership" has the meaning set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of
         Rule 16a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for purposes
         of this Code should be deemed to include, but not be limited to, any
         interest by which an Access Person or any Immediate Family Member of an
         Access Person can directly or indirectly derive a monetary or other
         economic benefit from the purchase, sale (or other acquisition or
         disposition) or ownership of a Security, including for this purpose any
         such interest that arises as a result of: a general partnership
         interest in a general or limited partnership; an interest in a trust; a
         right to dividends that is separated or separable from the underlying
         Security; a right to acquire equity Securities through the exercise or

         over which such person has supervisory responsibility, that arises
         solely from such person's compensation arrangement with Fahnestock or
         an Adviser pursuant to which the performance of the account or
         investment fund, or the profits or revenues derived from its management
         or supervision, is a factor in the determination of such person's
         compensation from Fahnestock or an Adviser.

<PAGE>
                                                                               5

         "Security" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(36) of the
         1940 Act and should be deemed to include any and all stock, debt
         obligations, and similar instruments of whatever kind, including any
         right or warrant to purchase a security, or option to acquire or sell a
         security, a group or index of securities or a foreign currency.
         References to a Security in this Code (e.g., a prohibition or
         requirement applicable to the purchase or sale of a Security) shall be
         deemed to refer to and to include any warrant for, option in, or
         Security immediately convertible into that Security, and shall also
         include any financial instrument which has an investment return or
         value that is based, in whole or part, on that Security (collectively,
         "Derivatives"). Therefore, except as otherwise specifically provided by
         this Code: (i) any prohibition or requirement of this Code applicable
         to the purchase or sale of a Security shall also be applicable to the
         purchase or sale of a Derivative relating to that Security; and (ii)
         any prohibition or requirement of this Code applicable to the purchase
         or sale of a Derivative shall also be applicable to the purchase or

         communicated and, with respect to the person making the recommendation,
         when such person seriously considers making such a recommendation.

SECTION III       OBJECTIVE AND GENERAL PROHIBITIONS

                  Although certain provisions of this Code apply only to Access
Persons, all Fund Employees must recognize that they are expected to conduct
their personal activities in accordance with the standards set forth in Section
I, III, IV and XI of this Code. Therefore, a Fund Employee may not engage in any
personal investment transaction under circumstances where the Fund Employee
benefits from or interferes with the purchase or sale of investments by a Fund.
In addition, Fund Employees may not use information concerning the investments
or investment intentions of a Fund, or their ability to influence such
investment intentions, for personal gain or in a manner detrimental to the
interests of any Fund. Disclosure by a Fund Employee of such information to any
person outside of the course of the responsibilities of the Fund Employee to a
Fund, an Adviser or Fahnestock will be deemed to be a violation of this
prohibition. All Fund Employees must also comply with the policies regarding the
misuse of material, non-public information, which are set forth in Section IV.

                  Fund Employees may not engage in conduct that is deceitful,
fraudulent, or manipulative, or which involves false or misleading statements,
in connection with the purchase or sale of investments by a Fund. In this
regard, Fund Employees should recognize that Rule 17j-1 makes it unlawful for
any affiliated person or principal underwriter of a Fund, or any affiliated
person of such a person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase
or sale of a Security held or to be acquired by a Fund to:

                      (i)    employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud
                             the Fund;

                      (ii)   make any untrue statement of a material fact to the
                             Fund or omit to state to the Fund a material fact
                             necessary in order to make the
<PAGE>
                                                                               6

                             statements made, in light of the circumstances
                             under which they are made, not misleading;

                      (iii)  engage in any act, practice, or course of business
                             that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
                             upon the Fund; or

                      (iv)   engage in any manipulative practice with respect to
                             the Fund.

                  Fund Employees should also recognize that a violation of this
Code or of Rule 17j-1 may result in the imposition of: (1) sanctions as provided
by Section XIII below; or (2) administrative, civil and, in certain cases,
criminal fines, sanctions or penalties.

SECTION IV        PROHIBITION AGAINST INSIDER TRADING

         (A)      INTRODUCTION

                  This Section IV of the Code is intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 204A of the Advisers Act, which is applicable to the
Advisers and requires that the Advisers establish and enforce procedures
designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by their
associated persons. It applies to all Fund Employees.

                  Trading Securities while in possession of material, non-public
information, or improperly communicating that information to others, may expose
a Fund Employee to severe penalties. Criminal sanctions may include a fine of up
to $1,000,000 and/or ten years imprisonment. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") can recover the profits gained or losses avoided through
the violative trading, impose a penalty of up to three times the illicit
windfall, and issue an order permanently barring a Fund Employee from the
securities industry. Finally, a Fund Employee may be sued by investors seeking
to recover damages for insider trading violations.

         (B)      POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING

                  No Fund Employee may trade a Security, either personally or on
behalf of any other person or account (including any Fund), while in possession
of material, non-public information concerning that Security or the issuer
thereof, nor may any Fund Employee communicate material, non-public information
to others in violation of the law.

                  (1)      DEFINITION OF MATERIAL INFORMATION

                  Information is material where there is a substantial
likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his
or her investment decisions. Generally, this includes any information the
disclosure of which will have a substantial effect on the price of a Security.
No simple test exists to determine when information is material; assessments of
materiality involve a highly fact specific inquiry. For this reason, Fund
Employees should direct any questions about whether information is material to
the Compliance Officer.

                  Material information often relates to a company's results and
operations, including, for example, dividend changes, earnings results, changes
in previously released
<PAGE>
                                                                               7

earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements,
major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management
developments. Material information may also relate to the market for a company's
Securities. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell Securities
may, in some contexts, be material. Pre-publication information regarding
reports in the financial press may also be material.

                  (2)       DEFINITION OF NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION

                  Information is "public" when it has been disseminated broadly
to investors in the marketplace. For example, information is public after it has
become available to the general public through a public filing with the SEC or
some other government agency, the Dow Jones "tape" or The Wall Street Journal or
some other publication of general circulation, and after sufficient time has
passed so that the information has been disseminated widely.

                  (3)       APPLICABLE PROCEDURES

                  A Fund Employee, before executing any trade for himself or
herself, or others, including a Fund or other accounts managed by an Adviser or
by a director, officer, member or partner of such Adviser, or any affiliate of
such director, officer, member or partner ("Client Accounts"), must determine
whether he or she has material, non-public information. A Fund Employee who
believes he or she is in possession of material, non-public information must
take the following steps:

                  o   Report the information and proposed trade immediately to
                      the Compliance Officer.

                  o   Do not purchase or sell the securities on behalf of
                      anyone, including Client Accounts.

                  o   Do not communicate the information to any person, other
                      than to the Compliance Officer.

                  After the Compliance Officer has reviewed the issue, the
affected Adviser will determine whether the information is material and
non-public and, if so, what action such Adviser and the Fund Employee should
take.

                  Fund Employees must consult with the Compliance Officer before
taking any action. This degree of caution will protect Fund Employees, clients
and the Advisers.

                  In lieu of following the foregoing procedures, Fund Employees
who are Non-Advantage Adviser Access Persons may follow the procedures of the
applicable Non-Advantage Adviser that would apply in similar circumstances.

                  (4)       CONTACTS WITH PUBLIC COMPANIES

                  Contacts with public companies will sometimes be a part of an
Adviser's research efforts. Persons providing investment advisory services to a
Fund may make investment decisions on the basis of conclusions formed through
such contacts and analysis of publicly
<PAGE>
                                                                               8

available information. Difficult legal issues arise, however, when, in the
course of these contacts, a Fund Employee becomes aware of material, non-public
information. This could happen, for example, if a company's chief financial
officer prematurely discloses quarterly results to an analyst, or an investor
relations representative makes selective disclosure of adverse news to a handful
of investors. In such situations, the affected Adviser must make a judgment as
to its further conduct. To protect yourself, clients and the Advisers, you
should contact the Compliance Officer immediately if you believe that you may
have received material, non-public information.

                  (5)       TENDER OFFERS

                  Tender offers represent a particular concern in the law of
insider trading for two reasons. First, tender offer activity often produces
extraordinary gyrations in the price of the target company's Securities. Trading
during this time period is more likely to attract regulatory attention (and
produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases). Second, the
SEC has adopted a rule that expressly forbids trading and "tipping" while in
possession of material, non-public information regarding a tender offer received
from the tender offeror, the target company or anyone acting on behalf of
either. Fund Employees should exercise particular caution any time they become
aware of non-public information relating to a tender offer.

SECTION V         PRE-CLEARANCE OF INVESTMENTS IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND
                  LIMITED OFFERINGS

                  Investment Personnel are required to obtain pre-clearance
prior to investing in an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") or in a Limited
Offering (see Section II - Definitions).

                  Investment Personnel who are Fahnestock Access Persons, as
associated persons of a member firm of the National Association of Securities
Dealers ("NASD"), are prohibited by the rules of the NASD from investing in any
IPO that qualifies as a "hot issue" under NASD rules. In addition, in accordance
with NASD rules and Fahnestock policy, Fahnestock Access Persons must obtain
written approval of the appropriate signatory at Fahnestock, as determined by
Fahnestock, prior to investing in a Limited Offering. In the event that
Fahnestock Access Persons are not prohibited by the foregoing from investing in
an IPO or are permitted by the foregoing to invest in a Limited Offering,
Fahnestock Access Persons are required to obtain pre-clearance for any such
transaction in accordance with the applicable procedures specified by Section
VII.

                  Investment Personnel who are Non-Advantage Adviser Access
Persons are required to obtain pre-clearance for investments in IPOs and Limited
Offerings in accordance with the procedures in the applicable Non-Advantage
Adviser Code.

SECTION VI        PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS

         (A)      THE FOLLOWING PROHIBITIONS APPLY TO BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT
                  FAHNESTOCK ACCESS PERSONS:

                  A Board Member of a Fund may-not purchase or otherwise acquire
direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership of any Security, and may not sell or
otherwise dispose of any Security in which he or she has direct or indirect
Beneficial Ownership, if he or she knows or
<PAGE>
                                                                               9

should know at the time of entering into the transaction that: (i) the Fund has
purchased or sold the Security within the last fifteen (15) calendar days, or is
purchasing or selling or is going to purchase or sell the Security in the next
fifteen (15) calendar days; or (ii) any person, on behalf of an Adviser, has
within the last fifteen (15) calendar days considered purchasing or selling the
Security or the Fund or is considering purchasing or selling the Security for
the Fund or within the next fifteen (15) calendar days is going to consider
purchasing or selling the Security for the Fund, unless the Board Member:

                  (1)   obtains pre-clearance of such transaction in accordance
                        with the procedures outlined in Section VII; and

                  (2)   reports to the Compliance Officer the information
                        described in Section VIII of this Code. 2

                  BECAUSE THE INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE
                  DAY-TO-DAY INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF ANY FUND, INDEPENDENT
                  BOARD MEMBERS WILL, IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO THE
                  CONTRARY, BE PRESUMED NOT TO HAVE THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE OF
                  THE FUNDS' TRANSACTIONS SO AS TO REQUIRE PRE-CLEARANCE OF
                  TRANSACTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS SHALL NOT
                  BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRE-CLEARANCE OF A TRANSACTION UNLESS AT
                  THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION THEY HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE
                  MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

                  HOWEVER, THOSE BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT INDEPENDENT BOARD
                  MEMBERS SHALL BE PRESUMED TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS IS
                  DESCRIBED ABOVE AND MUST THEREFORE OBTAIN PRE-CLEARANCE OF
                  TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION VII
                  EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION AS TO WHICH ONE OF THE
                  EXCEPTIONS FROM PRE-CLEARANCE SET FORTH IN SECTION VI(D) BELOW
                  APPLIES.

                  Any transaction that is (i) effected without pre-clearance
where the Board Member of a Fund had actual knowledge that the Fund had
purchased or sold the Security within the fifteen (15) calendar day period
described above, or (ii) effected (with or without pre-clearance) where the
Board Member had actual knowledge that the Security was at the time being
considered for purchase or sale by the Fund and without disclosure of such
knowledge by the Board Member in seeking pre-clearance, is prohibited by this
Code.

         (B)      THE FOLLOWING PROHIBITIONS APPLY TO FAHNESTOCK ACCESS PERSONS:

                  As determined by the Compliance Officer, Fahnestock Access
Persons are subject to the prohibitions of this Section VI(B) of this Code with
regard to their personal investment transactions.


- ----------
2        The prohibitions of this Section VI apply to Securities acquired or

         the extent that one of the exceptions from the prohibitions set forth
         in Section VI(D) is applicable.

                  If subject to this Section VI(B), a Fahnestock Access Person
may not purchase or otherwise acquire direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership of
any Security, and may not sell or otherwise dispose of any Security in which he
or she has direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership, if he or she knows or should
know at the time of entering into the transaction that: (i) a Fund has purchased
or sold the Security within the last seven (7) calendar days, or is purchasing
or selling or is going to purchase or sell the Security in the next seven (7)
calendar days; or (ii) any person, on behalf of any of the Advisers, has within
the last seven (7) calendar days considered purchasing or selling the Security
for a Fund or is considering purchasing or selling the Security for a Fund or
within the next seven (7) calendar days is going to consider purchasing or
selling the Security for a Fund, unless the Fahnestock Access Person:

                        Section VII and

                  (2)   reports to the Compliance Officer the information

Adviser Access Persons shall not discuss the current investment transactions of
a Fund with any other Fund Employees (including personnel of Fahnestock), or
provide other Fund Employees with information as to Securities being considered

providing services to the Fund.

                  (7)   Involuntary (i.e., non-volitional) purchases and sales
                        of Securities;

                  (8)   Transactions in an account over which the Access Person
                        does not exercise, directly or indirectly, any influence
                        or control; provided, however, that such influence or
                        control shall be presumed to exist in the case of the
                        account of an Immediate Family Member of the Access
                        Person, absent an advance written determination by the
                        Compliance Officer to the contrary; and

                  (9)   Transactions in a Security (which shall for the purpose
                        of this exemption be deemed to include a series of
                        related transactions in a Security) involving 500 shares
                        or less of the stock of an issuer that has a market
                        capitalization (i.e., outstanding shares multiplied by
                        the current price per share) of $1 billion or more,
                        unless the Access Person has actual knowledge at the
                        time of the transaction or transactions that: (i) a Fund
                        purchased or sold the Security within the past seven (7)
                        calendar days; or (ii) the Security is being considered
                        for purchase or sale by a Fund.

SECTION VII       PRE-CLEARANCE PROCEDURES

                  The procedures in this Section VII apply where pre-clearance
is required by Section V, Section VI(A) or Section VI(B). All personal
transactions by any Non-Advantage Adviser Access Persons are subject to the
provisions of the applicable Non-Advantage Adviser Code, including provisions
related to pre-clearance.

         (A)      OBTAINING PRE-CLEARANCE

                  Pre-clearance of a personal transaction in a Security may be
obtained only from the Compliance Officer or a person who has been designated by
the Compliance Officer to pre-clear transactions. The Compliance Officer and
these designated persons are each referred to as a "Clearing Officer." A
Clearing Officer seeking pre-clearance with respect to his or her own
transaction shall obtain such clearance from another Clearing Officer.

         (B)      TIME OF CLEARANCE

                  (1)   An Access Person may pre-clear a trade only where such
                        person has a present intention to effect a transaction
                        in the Security for which pre-clearance is sought. It is
                        not appropriate for an Access Person to obtain a general
                        or open-ended pre-clearance to cover the eventuality
                        that he or she may buy or sell a Security at some future
                        time depending upon market developments. Consistent with
                        the foregoing, Access Persons may not simultaneously
                        request pre-clearance to buy and sell the same Security.

                                                                              12

                  (2)   Pre-clearance of a trade shall be valid and in effect
                        only for a period of two trading days, including the day
                        pre-clearance is given; provided, however, that a
                        pre-clearance expires upon the Access Person receiving
                        pre-clearance becoming aware of facts or circumstances
                        that would prevent a proposed trade from being
                        pre-cleared were such facts or circumstances made known
                        to a Clearing Officer. Accordingly, if an Access Person
                        becomes aware of new or changed facts or circumstances
                        that give rise to a question as to whether pre-clearance
                        could be obtained if a Clearing Officer was aware of
                        such facts or circumstances, the Access Person shall be
                        required to so advise a Clearing Officer and obtain a
                        new pre-clearance before proceeding with such
                        transaction.

         (C)      FORM

                  Pre-clearance must be obtained in writing by completing and
signing the form provided for that purpose, which form shall set forth the
details of the proposed transaction, and by obtaining the signature of a
Clearing Officer. The form to be used in seeking pre-clearance is attached as
Schedule C.

         (D)      FILING

                  Copies of all completed pre-clearance forms, with the required
signatures, shall be retained by the Compliance Officer.

         (E)      FACTORS CONSIDERED IN PRE-CLEARANCE OF PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS

                  A Clearing Officer may refuse to grant pre-clearance of a
personal transaction in his or her sole discretion without being required to
specify any reason for the refusal. Generally, a Clearing Officer will consider
the following factors in determining whether or not to pre-clear a proposed
transaction:

                  (1)   Whether the amount or nature of the transaction or
                        person making it is likely to affect the price or market
                        for the Security;

                  (2)   Whether the person making the proposed purchase or sale
                        is likely to benefit from purchases or sales being made
                        or being considered on behalf of a Fund;

                  (3)   Whether the chance of a conflict of interest is remote;
                        and

                  (4)   Whether the transaction is likely to affect a Fund
                        adversely.

SECTION VIII      REPORTS BY BOARD MEMBERS

                  Board Members shall file the reports set forth in this Section
VIII; provided, however, that Independent Board Members are not required to file
Initial Holdings Reports or Annual Holdings Reports.

                        to the Compliance Officer of all transactions occurring
                        in the quarter by which he or she acquired or disposed

                  (3)   A Quarterly Transaction Report may contain a statement
                        that the report is not to be construed as an admission
                        that the person making it has or had any direct or
                        indirect Beneficial Ownership in any Security to which
                        the report relates.

                  (4)   An Independent Board Member is not required to file a
                        Quarterly Transaction Report unless he or she knew or,

SECTION IX        REPORTS BY FAHNESTOCK ACCESS PERSONS

                  It is the responsibility of each Fahnestock Access Person to
take the initiative to comply with the requirements of this Section IX. Any
effort by a Fund, by an Adviser or by Fahnestock to facilitate the reporting
process does not change or alter that responsibility.

         (A)      INITIAL CERTIFICATIONS AND INITIAL HOLDINGS REPORTS

                  Within ten (10) days of becoming an Access Person, Fahnestock

Ownership are held, purchased or sold ("Personal Securities Accounts"), along

                            in any Fund);

                            or any other type of acquisition or disposition);

                  (3)   An Access Person shall not be required to file a
                        Quarterly Transaction Report for a calendar quarter if
                        the Compliance Officer is being furnished with
                        confirmations and statements for all Personal Securities
                        Accounts of such Access Person, provided that the Access
                        Person has no reportable transactions other than those
                        reflected in the confirmations and statements for such
                        accounts.

                  (4)   A Quarterly Transaction Report may contain a statement
                        that the report is not to be construed as an admission
                        that the person making it has or had any direct or
                        indirect Beneficial Ownership in any Security to which

                        Access Persons with the reporting requirements of any
                        comparable procedures to which such Fahnestock Access
                        Persons are subject shall be deemed to satisfy the
                        requirements of this Section and the requirements of
                        Rule 17j-1 regarding Quarterly Transaction Reports (as

                        reasonably designed to detect and prevent activities
                        that would constitute violations of Rule 17j-1.

                  In connection with any such amendment or modification, the
                  Board Members must receive a certification from the Compliance
                  Officer certifying that procedures reasonably necessary to
                  prevent Access Persons from violating the Code, as proposed to
                  be amended or modified, have been adopted.

         (F)      The Compliance Officer may delegate to one or more other
                  officers or employees of Fahnestock such responsibilities of
                  the Compliance Officer as he or she may deem appropriate;
                  provided, that: (i) any such delegation shall be set forth in
                  writing and retained as part of the records of the applicable
                  Fund and the Adviser; and (ii) it shall be the responsibility
                  of the Compliance Officer to supervise the performance by such
                  persons of the responsibilities that have been delegated to
                  them.

SECTION XV        COORDINATION WITH OTHER CODES OF ETHICS

                  Certain of the Board Members and Fahnestock Access Persons are
also subject to similar codes of ethics adopted by other registered investment
companies organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies,
which other companies have as their adviser a limited liability company in which
Fahnestock is the managing member ("Affiliated Funds"). The use by such persons
of any form prescribed under the code of ethics of an Affiliated Fund, in lieu
of the corresponding form specified herein, shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this Code.
