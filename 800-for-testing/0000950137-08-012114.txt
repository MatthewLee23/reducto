PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH
MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2008

MARKET CONDITIONS

The U.S. economic picture weakened over the course of the 12-month reporting
period as the pace of growth slowed while inflationary pressures, particularly
rising food and oil prices, began to grow. These factors, coupled with the
declining housing market, weighed on consumers and translated into slower
earnings growth for many corporate borrowers in the senior loan market as demand
for their products and services declined. At the same time, the dislocations
stemming from the problems in the subprime mortgage sector permeated the capital
markets, leading to a significant contraction in credit and liquidity and
considerable losses for many financial firms.

The Federal Reserve (the "Fed") took several steps to help support both the
economy and market liquidity, including reducing the target federal funds rate a
total of 325 basis points during the period, bringing the rate to 2.0 percent by
the end of April. In the final months of the period the Fed held rates steady in
an effort to limit inflationary pressures, although concerns of an economic
recession remained.

In the aggregate, it was a volatile and challenging period for the financial
markets. The uncertain environment prompted many investors to shun riskier
assets, which resulted in diminished performance for most sectors of the market.
The senior loan market faced additional challenges. While demand for senior
loans was declining, the supply of loans coming to market--particularly in the
fourth quarter of 2007--was rising, creating a technical demand/supply imbalance
that put considerable pressure on prices, which reached a low for the period in
March. Tighter lending standards and increased selling by retail and relative
value investors also contributed to price declines. In April, the technical
picture began to improve as large underwriting banks made substantial progress
working down the inventory of underwritten but not yet syndicated leveraged
loans while low loan prices attracted new money into the asset class from
private equity and credit opportunity funds. As a result, loan prices rose,
reaching their highest level for the calendar year so far in mid-June. At the
end of June, however, the market reversed course again due in large part to
concerns about underlying credit fundamentals amid negative news regarding the
auto industry and mortgage lenders Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).
Although the default rate in the senior loan market increased to approximately
three percent by period end, it still remained below the historical average.
Given the weaker economic outlook, we anticipate defaults may continue to rise,
but we believe the senior loan asset class remains compelling due to the senior
secured nature of loans and their attractive current yields.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the Trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. For the 12 months ended July 31, 2008, the Trust returned -24.32 percent
on a market price basis and -11.59 percent on an NAV basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and Trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information.

We continued to adhere to our research-intensive investment process, employing a
bottom-up asset selection process driven by thorough analysis of individual
company fundamentals, and have not relaxed our rigorous credit standards. We
believe this approach may enable us to limit our credit losses during this down
cycle and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that arise during volatile
periods such as that we are currently experiencing.

We continued to position the portfolio defensively, generally avoiding sectors
or industries that we believe are vulnerable to cyclical economic downturns. For
example, the Trust remained underweighted in the auto and airline industries
because of their susceptibility to high fuel prices. We made relatively few
changes to the portfolio during the reporting year, and as of the end of the
period, the Trust's largest sector weightings were Printing & Publishing;
Beverage, Food & Tobacco; and Hotels, Motels, Inns & Gaming.

The Trust remained fully invested in senior secured loans, and used a modest
amount of leverage which may allow us to enhance the Trust's yield while keeping
credit standards high. Leverage involves borrowing at a floating short-term rate
and reinvesting the proceeds at a higher rate. Unlike other fixed-income asset
classes, using leverage in conjunction with senior loans does not involve the
same degree of risk from rising short-term interest rates since the income from
senior loans adjusts to changes in interest rates, as do the rates which
determine the Trust's borrowing costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall,
borrowing costs would also decline.) While we believe this portfolio structure
(fully invested, modest leverage) adds value for shareholders over a full cycle,
it has been a drag on performance in the short term. Because the recent

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

market volatility has been driven as much by technical factors as by changes in
underlying fundamentals, we have not altered the use of leverage in the Trust as
we believe it is difficult to "time" technical events in the market. Therefore,
portfolio composition continues to be driven by fundamental credit research.

Although it has been a difficult period, we believe it has created attractive
investment opportunities. Loans coming to market today are offering better
spreads and stronger credit structures than we have seen in the past few years.
These more investor-friendly terms may lead to attractive risk/reward
characteristics for investors going forward. Current prices and yields in the
secondary market also offer compelling opportunities. In addition, merger and
acquisition activity continues, which has historically meant continued deal
flows for senior secured lenders. Going forward, we will remain focused on
ensuring the Trust has sufficient liquidity while maintaining a high quality,
well-diversified portfolio of issuers with stable cash flows, strong management
teams.

The Trust's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common
shares is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the
market value of the Trust's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you
that the Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the Trust may, when
appropriate, purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions at a price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is
lower at the time of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

At meetings held on April 15, 2008 and May 8, 2008, the Board of Trustees, and
the independent trustees voting separately, considered and ultimately determined
that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and
approved the continuance of the investment advisory agreement as being in the
best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In making its determination,
the Board of Trustees considered materials that were specifically prepared by
the investment adviser at the request of the Board and Fund counsel, and by an
independent provider of investment company data contracted to assist the Board,
relating to the investment advisory agreement review process. The Board also
considered information received periodically about the portfolio, performance,
the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and expenses of the
Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the investment advisory agreement over a
period of several months and the trustees held sessions both with the investment
adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and considering
the investment advisory agreement.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of

 8
<PAGE>

factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund and changes made
in the Fund's portfolio management team and the Fund's portfolio management
strategy over time. The trustees also discuss certain other services which are
provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the investment adviser or its
affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain accounting, administrative
and legal services. The Board has determined that the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the investment adviser support its decision to
approve the investment advisory agreement.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory agreement.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio
management-related

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated expenses both on an
aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that the analysis of the
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory agreement.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets applicable to common
shares.

(a) All or a portion of this security is payment-in-kind.

(b) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(d) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(e) All or a portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(f) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(g) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2008.

(h) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(i) Non-income producing security.

(j) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents less
    than 0.1% of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate

    the actual remaining maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust
    estimates that the actual average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its
    portfolio will be approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2008

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 23, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Trust
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Trust's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and
notes for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the
mean of such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily
available, Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent
market indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board
of Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing
sources approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate, interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit
worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until next
interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loan.
Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have
adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The
fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by the Trust's Valuation
Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Credit default swaps are valued using market quotations obtained from
brokers.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are

                                                                              39

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2008 continued

expected to result in the restructuring of a plan of reorganization for an
investment are recorded as realized losses. The Trust may purchase and sell
securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis, with settlement to
occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased is subject to
market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will segregate assets with the
custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until payment is made. At
July 31, 2008, the Trust had no when-issued or delayed delivery purchase
commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Trust adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes on January 31, 2008. FIN 48 sets forth a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any
unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements. If
applicable, the Trust recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits in "Interest Expense" and penalties in "Other" expenses on the
Statement of Operations. The Trust files tax returns with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service and various states. Generally, each of the tax years in the four
year period ended July 31, 2008, remains subject to examination by taxing
authorities.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2008, the Trust had

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually to common shareholders. Distributions
from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term capital gains,
which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended July 31, 2008
and 2007 were as follows:

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions, gains and losses recognized on securities for tax purposes
but not for book purposes and post October losses which are not realized for tax
purposes until the first day of the following fiscal year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the year ended July 31, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $235,300 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Employment
agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides compliance
services to the Trust. The costs of these services are allocated to each trust.
For the year ended July 31, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately
$131,600 representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates'
(collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the Trust, as
well as the salary, benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support
staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services
agreement are reported as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement of
Operations. Services provided pursuant to the CCO Employment agreement are
reported as part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

The Board of Trustees have approved a share repurchase program whereby the Trust
may, when appropriate, repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is
lower at the time of purchase.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $1,060,121,855 and
$1,315,826,769, respectively.

5. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain Senior Loan agreements, the Trust had unfunded
loan commitments of approximately $85,029,397 as of July 31, 2008. The Trust
intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $9,431,217 as of July 31, 2008 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as
to attempt to protect the Trust against possible changes in the market value of
its portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Trust's portfolio
holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with
the change in value reflected in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Risks may
arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts.

                                                                              43
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2008 continued

    The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may otherwise invest. A
credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said to buy protection by
paying periodic fees in return for a contingent payment from the seller if the
issuer has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding
obligations or deteriorating credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a
credit default swap is said to sell protection and thus collects the periodic
fees and profits if the credit of the issuer remains stable or improves while
the swap is outstanding but the seller in a credit default swap contract would
be required to pay an agreed-upon amount, which approximates the notional amount
of the swap as disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments, to
the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the issuer. The Trust
accrues for the periodic fees on credit default swaps on a daily basis with the
net amount accrued recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap
contracts. Upon cash settlement of the periodic fees, the net amount is recorded
as realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statement of Operations. Net
unrealized gains are recorded as an asset or net unrealized losses are reported
as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value
of the swap contracts is reported as unrealized gains or losses on the Statement
of Operations. Payments received or made upon entering into a credit default
swap contract, if any, are recorded as realized gain or loss on the Statement of
Operations upon termination or maturity of the swap. Credit default swaps may
involve greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the issuer directly.
Credit default swaps are subject to general market risk, counterparty risk and
credit risk.

    If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap agreement, the Trust
will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. Counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on
the valuation of each swap) on behalf of the Trust with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain. Reciprocally, when the Trust has an
unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Trust has instructed the custodian to
pledge cash or liquid securities as collateral with a value approximately equal
to the amount of the unrealized loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate. Cash collateral
is disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments. Cash
collateral has been offset against open swap contracts under the provisions of
FASB Interpretation No. 39: Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts
an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105 and are
included within "Swap Contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. For
cash collateral received, the Trust pays a monthly fee to the counterparty based
on the effective rate for Federal Funds. This fee, when paid, is included within
realized loss on swap contracts on the Statement of Operations.

7. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

8. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a Trust generally may not (i) borrow money
greater than 33 1/3% of the Trust's total assets or (ii) issue preferred shares
greater than 50% of the Trust's total assets. In using a combination of
borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum allowable leverage is
somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more than 50%) of the Trust's
total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million annual revolving credit and
security agreement. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of
the Trust. In connection with this agreement, for the year ended July 31, 2008,
the Trust incurred fees of approximately $1,741,200. For the year ended July 31,
2008, the average daily balance of borrowings under the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement was $370,852,459 with a weighted average
interest rate of 4.73%. Effective September 13, 2008, the Trust changed its
Credit and Security Agreement to $625 million.

9. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

The Trust has outstanding 2,800 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series W,
Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares (APS), $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $350 million. This reflects the
Trust's redemption of 2,800 shares of each class, which occurred between May 19,
2008 and May 23, 2008. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are
generally reset every seven days through an auction process. Beginning on
February 12, 2008 and continuing through July 31, 2008, all series of preferred
shares of the Trust were not successfully remarketed. As a result, the dividend
rates of these preferred shares were reset to the maximum applicable rate on
APS. The average rate in effect on July 31, 2008 was 3.925%. During the year
ended July 31, 2008, the rates ranged from 3.794% to 6.300%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

                                                                              45

10. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

11. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements (FAS 157), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of July 31, 2008, the Adviser does not believe the adoption of
FAS 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements, however,
additional disclosures will be required about the inputs used to develop the
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported on
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.

    On March 19, 2008, FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS
161). FAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies
for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and
gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The
application of FAS 161 is required for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after November 15, 2008. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FAS 161 and its impact on the financial statements has not yet
been determined.

12. LEGAL MATTERS

The Trust is one of numerous defendants ("Lenders") that have been named in an
adversary proceeding pending in the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of
Florida. The action was filed on July 15, 2008, by the Official Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of home building companies to which the Lenders loaned money
through credit agreements. Plaintiff alleges that monies used to repay the
Lenders should be avoided as fraudulent and preferential transfers under the
bankruptcy laws. More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that subsidiaries of the
home building companies were allegedly forced to become co-borrowers and
guarantors of the monies used to repay the Lenders, and that the subsidiaries
did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value when they
transferred the proceeds to repay the Lenders. Plaintiff seeks to avoid the
transfers and other equitable relief. The Lenders have moved to dismiss the
complaint. That motion is now pending.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Income Trust

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of July 31, 2008, the related statements of operations and cash
flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian, brokers and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and simple
way to reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions into additional
shares of the Trust. Under the Plan, the money you earn from dividends and
capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically in more shares of
the Trust, allowing you to potentially increase your investment over time.

PLAN BENEFITS

- - ADD TO YOUR ACCOUNT

You may increase your shares in the Trust easily and automatically with the
Plan.

- - LOW TRANSACTION COSTS

Transaction costs are low because the new shares are bought in blocks and the
brokerage commission is shared among all participants.

- - CONVENIENCE

You will receive a detailed account statement from Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., which administers the Plan, whenever shares are reinvested for you. The
statement shows your total distributions, date of investment, shares acquired,
and price per share, as well as the total number of shares in your reinvestment
account. You can also access your account via the Internet. To do this, please
go to vankampen.com.

- - SAFEKEEPING

Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will hold the shares it has acquired for you
in safekeeping.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN

    If you own shares in your own name, you can participate directly in the
Plan. If your shares are held in "street name"--in the name of your brokerage
firm, bank, or other financial institution--you must instruct that entity to
participate on your behalf. If they are unable to participate on your behalf,
you may request that they reregister your shares in your own name so that you
may enroll in the Plan.

    If you choose to participate in the Plan, whenever the Trust declares a
dividend or capital gains distribution, it will be invested in additional shares
of your Trust that are purchased on the open market.

HOW TO ENROLL

    To enroll in the Plan, please read the Terms and Conditions in the Plan
brochure. You can obtain a copy of the Plan Brochure and enroll in the Plan by
visiting vankampen.com, calling toll-free (800) 341-2929 or notifying us in
writing at Van Kampen Closed End Funds, Computershare Trust Company,

N.A., P.O. Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078. Please include the Trust name
and account number and ensure that all shareholders listed on the account sign
these written instructions. Your participation in the Plan will begin with the
next dividend or capital gains distribution payable after Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. receives your authorization, as long as they receive it before the
"record date," which is generally ten business days before the dividend is paid.
If your authorization arrives after such record date, your participation in the
Plan will begin with the following dividend or distribution.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    There is no direct charge to you for reinvesting dividends and capital gains
distributions because the Plan's fees are paid by the Trust. However, when
applicable, you will pay your portion of any brokerage commissions incurred when
the new shares are purchased on the open market. These brokerage commissions are
typically less than the standard brokerage charges for individual transactions,
because shares are purchased for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower
commissions for each individual participant. Any brokerage commissions or
service fees are averaged into the purchase price.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    The automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions does
not relieve you of any income tax that may be due on dividends or distributions.
You will receive tax information annually to help you prepare your federal and
state income tax returns.

    Van Kampen does not offer tax advice. The tax information contained herein

date of any amendment. In the case of termination, Participants will receive
written notice at least 30 days before the record date for the payment of any
dividend or capital gains distribution by the Trust. In the case of amendment or

authority, such written notice will not be required.

                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

2. DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3. AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4. AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5. TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6. ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7. PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8. PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10. COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Asset Management

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
       6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to
       Covered Entities to the extent that the services

Affiliate will vote proxies under this Policy pursuant to authority granted
under its applicable investment advisory agreement or, in the absence of such
authority, as authorized by the Board of Directors/Trustees of the MSIM Funds.
An MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA
account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of an account not
governed by ERISA, the investment management or investment advisory agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will vote
proxies

<PAGE>

in a prudent and diligent manner and in the best interests of clients, including
beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for which the
MSIM Affiliates manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing
long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a
client or its fiduciary may provide an MSIM Affiliate with a proxy voting
policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's
policy.

Proxy Research Services - RiskMetrics Group ISS Governance Services ("ISS") and
Glass Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as we may retain from
time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers that specialize
in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to
institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and
other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth research,
global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While we may review and
utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers in making proxy voting
decisions, we are in no way obligated to follow such recommendations. In
addition to research, ISS provides vote execution, reporting, and recordkeeping.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - Voting proxies of companies
located in some jurisdictions, particularly emerging markets, may involve
several problems that can restrict or prevent the ability to vote such proxies
or entail significant costs. These problems include, but are not limited to: (i)
proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other than English;
(ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings; (iii)
restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction of
organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person; (v)
the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate our voting instructions. As a
result, we vote clients' non-U.S. proxies on a best efforts basis only, after
weighing the costs and benefits of voting such proxies, consistent with the
Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance in connection
with voting non-U.S. proxies.

II. GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To promote consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, we follow
this Policy (subject to any exception set forth herein), including the
guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range of issues,
and provide general voting parameters on proposals that arise most frequently.
However, details of specific proposals vary, and those details affect particular
voting decisions, as do factors specific to a given company. Pursuant to the
procedures set forth herein, we may vote in a manner that is not in accordance
with the following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the
Proxy Review Committee (see Section III for description) and is consistent with
the Client Proxy Standard. Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP will follow the procedures
as described in Appendix A.

We endeavor to integrate governance and proxy voting policy with investment
goals and to follow the Client Proxy Standard for each client. At times, this
may result in split votes, for example when different clients have varying
economic interests in the outcome of a particular voting matter (such as a case
in which varied ownership interests in two companies involved in a merger result
in different stakes in the outcome). We also may split votes at times based on
differing views of portfolio managers, but such a split vote must be approved by
the Proxy Review Committee.

We may abstain on matters for which disclosure is inadequate.

A. ROUTINE MATTERS. We generally support routine management proposals. The
following are examples of routine management proposals:

     -    Approval of financial statements and auditor reports.

     -    General updating/corrective amendments to the charter, articles of
          association or bylaws.

     -    Most proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, with the
          following exceptions. We generally oppose proposals that relate to
          "the transaction of such other business which may come before the
          meeting," and open-ended requests for adjournment. However, where
          management specifically states the reason for requesting an
          adjournment and the requested

<PAGE>

          adjournment would facilitate passage of a proposal that would
          otherwise be supported under this Policy (i.e. an uncontested
          corporate transaction), the adjournment request will be supported.

We generally support shareholder proposals advocating confidential voting
procedures and independent tabulation of voting results.

B. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     1.   Election of directors: In the absence of a proxy contest, we generally
          support the board's nominees for director except as follows:

          a.   We consider withholding support from or voting against interested
               directors if the company's board does not meet market standards
               for director independence, or if otherwise we believe board
               independence is insufficient. We refer to prevalent market
               standards as promulgated by a stock exchange or other authority
               within a given market (e.g., New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq
               rules for most U.S. companies, and The Combined Code on Corporate
               Governance in the United Kingdom). Thus, for an NYSE company with
               no controlling shareholder, we would expect that at a minimum a
               majority of directors should be independent as defined by NYSE.
               Where we view market standards as inadequate, we may withhold
               votes based on stronger independence standards. Market standards
               notwithstanding, we generally do not view long board tenure alone
               as a basis to classify a director as non-independent, although
               lack of board turnover and fresh perspective can be a negative
               factor in voting on directors.

               i.   At a company with a shareholder or group that controls the
                    company by virtue of a majority economic interest in the
                    company, we have a reduced expectation for board
                    independence, although we believe the presence of
                    independent directors can be helpful, particularly in
                    staffing the audit committee, and at times we may withhold
                    support from or vote against a nominee on the view the board
                    or its committees are not sufficiently independent.

               ii.  We consider withholding support from or voting against a
                    nominee if he or she is affiliated with a major shareholder
                    that has representation on a board disproportionate to its
                    economic interest.

          b.   Depending on market standards, we consider withholding support
               from or voting against a nominee who is interested and who is
               standing for election as a member of the company's compensation,
               nominating or audit committee.

          c.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               if we believe a direct conflict exists between the interests of
               the nominee and the public shareholders, including failure to
               meet fiduciary standards of care and/or loyalty. We may oppose
               directors where we conclude that actions of directors are
               unlawful, unethical or negligent. We consider opposing individual
               board members or an entire slate if we believe the board is
               entrenched and/or dealing inadequately with performance problems,
               and/or acting with insufficient independence between the board
               and management.

          d.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               standing for election if the board has not taken action to
               implement generally accepted governance practices for which there
               is a "bright line" test. For example, in the context of the U.S.
               market, failure to eliminate a dead hand or slow hand poison
               pills would be seen as a basis for opposing one or more incumbent
               nominees.

<PAGE>

          e.   In markets that encourage designated audit committee financial
               experts, we consider voting against members of an audit committee
               if no members are designated as such.

          f.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               who has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings within a
               given year without a reasonable excuse.

          g.   We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee
               who serves on the board of directors of more than six companies
               (excluding investment companies). We also consider voting against
               a director who otherwise appears to have too many commitments to
               serve adequately on the board of the company.

     2.   Board independence: We generally support U.S. shareholder proposals
          requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%) of the company's
          board members be independent directors, and promoting all-independent
          audit, compensation and nominating/governance committees.

     3.   Board diversity: We consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder
          proposals urging diversity of board membership with respect to social,
          religious or ethnic group.

     4.   Majority voting: We generally support proposals requesting or
          requiring majority voting policies in election of directors, so long
          as there is a carve-out for plurality voting in the case of contested
          elections.

     5.   Proxy access: We consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder
          proposals to provide procedures for inclusion of shareholder nominees
          in company proxy statements.

     6.   Proposals to elect all directors annually: We generally support
          proposals to elect all directors annually at public companies (to
          "declassify" the Board of Directors) where such action is supported by
          the board, and otherwise consider the issue on a case-by-case basis
          based in part on overall takeover defenses at a company.

     7.   Cumulative voting: We generally support proposals to eliminate
          cumulative voting in the U.S. market context. (Cumulative voting
          provides that shareholders may concentrate their votes for one or a
          handful of candidates, a system that can enable a minority bloc to
          place representation on a board). U.S. proposals to establish
          cumulative voting in the election of directors generally will not be
          supported.

     8.   Separation of Chairman and CEO positions: We vote on shareholder
          proposals to separate the Chairman and CEO positions and/or to appoint
          a non-executive Chairman based in part on prevailing practice in
          particular markets, since the context for such a practice varies. In
          many non-U.S. markets, we view separation of the roles as a market
          standard practice, and support division of the roles in that context.

     9.   Director retirement age and term limits: Proposals recommending set
          director retirement ages or director term limits are voted on a
          case-by-case basis.

     10.  Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden indemnification
          of directors. Generally, we will support such proposals provided that
          the officers and directors are eligible for indemnification and
          liability protection if they have acted in good faith on company
          business and were found innocent of any civil or criminal charges for
          duties performed on behalf of the company.

C. CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS AND PROXY FIGHTS. We examine proposals relating to
mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers,
spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations, restructurings and
recapitalizations) on a case-by-case basis. However, proposals for mergers or
other significant transactions that are friendly and approved by the Research
Providers generally will be supported and in those instances will not need to be
reviewed by the Proxy Review

<PAGE>

Committee, where there is no portfolio manager objection and where there is no
material conflict of interest. We also analyze proxy contests on a case-by-case
basis.

D. CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

     1.   We generally support the following:

          -    Management and shareholder proposals aimed at eliminating unequal
               voting rights, assuming fair economic treatment of classes of
               shares we hold.

          -    Management proposals to increase the authorization of existing
               classes of common stock (or securities convertible into common
               stock) if: (i) a clear business purpose is stated that we can
               support and the number of shares requested is reasonable in
               relation to the purpose for which authorization is requested;
               and/or (ii) the authorization does not exceed 100% of shares
               currently authorized and at least 30% of the total new
               authorization will be outstanding.

          -    Management proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or
               for issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital,
               unless we have concerns about use of the authority for
               anti-takeover purposes.

          -    Management proposals to authorize share repurchase plans, except
               in some cases in which we believe there are insufficient
               protections against use of an authorization for anti-takeover
               purposes.

          -    Management proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of
               common or preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred
               stock.

          -    Management proposals to effect stock splits.

          -    Management proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
               proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in
               the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
               proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be
               approved if the resulting increase in authorized shares coincides
               with the proxy guidelines set forth above for common stock
               increases.

          -    Management proposals for higher dividend payouts.

     2.   We generally oppose the following (notwithstanding management
          support):

          -    Proposals to add classes of stock that would substantially dilute
               the voting interests of existing shareholders.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorized or issued number of shares
               of existing classes of stock that are unreasonably dilutive,
               particularly if there are no preemptive rights for existing
               shareholders.

          -    Proposals that authorize share issuance at a discount to market
               rates, except where authority for such issuance is de minimis, or
               if there is a special situation that we believe justifies such
               authorization (as may be the case, for example, at a company
               under severe stress and risk of bankruptcy).

          -    Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

We consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder proposals to increase dividend
payout ratios, in light of market practice and perceived market weaknesses, as
well as individual company payout history and current circumstances. For
example, currently we perceive low payouts to shareholders as a

<PAGE>

concern at some Japanese companies, but may deem a low payout ratio as
appropriate for a growth company making good use of its cash, notwithstanding
the broader market concern.

E. TAKEOVER DEFENSES AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

     1.   Shareholder rights plans: We generally support proposals to require
          shareholder approval or ratification of shareholder rights plans
          (poison pills). In voting on rights plans or similar takeover
          defenses, we consider on a case-by-case basis whether the company has
          demonstrated a need for the defense in the context of promoting
          long-term share value; whether provisions of the defense are in line
          with generally accepted governance principles; and the specific
          context if the proposal is made in the midst of a takeover bid or
          contest for control.

     2.   Supermajority voting requirements: We generally oppose requirements
          for supermajority votes to amend the charter or bylaws, unless the
          provisions protect minority shareholders where there is a large
          shareholder. In line with this view, in the absence of a large
          shareholder we support reasonable shareholder proposals to limit such
          supermajority voting requirements.

     3.   Shareholder rights to call meetings: We consider proposals to enhance
          shareholder rights to call meetings on a case-by-case basis.

     4.   Reincorporation: We consider management and shareholder proposals to
          reincorporate to a different jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. We
          oppose such proposals if we believe the main purpose is to take
          advantage of laws or judicial precedents that reduce shareholder
          rights.

     5.   Anti-greenmail provisions: Proposals relating to the adoption of
          anti-greenmail provisions will be supported, provided that the
          proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to
          large block holders (holders of at least 1% of the outstanding shares
          and in certain cases, a greater amount, as determined by the Proxy
          Review Committee) not made to all shareholders or not approved by
          disinterested shareholders; and (iii) contains no anti-takeover
          measures or other provisions restricting the rights of shareholders.

     6.   Bundled proposals: We may consider opposing or abstaining on proposals
          if disparate issues are "bundled" and presented for a single vote.

F. AUDITORS. We generally support management proposals for selection or
ratification of independent auditors. However, we may consider opposing such
proposals with reference to incumbent audit firms if the company has suffered
from serious accounting irregularities and we believe rotation of the audit firm
is appropriate, or if fees paid to the auditor for non-audit-related services
are excessive. Generally, to determine if non-audit fees are excessive, a 50%
test will be applied (i.e., non-audit-related fees should be less than 50% of
the total fees paid to the auditor). We generally vote against proposals to
indemnify auditors.

G. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR REMUNERATION.

     1.   We generally support the following proposals:

          -    Proposals for employee equity compensation plans and other
               employee ownership plans, provided that our research does not
               indicate that approval of the plan would be against shareholder
               interest. Such approval may be against shareholder interest if it
               authorizes excessive dilution and shareholder cost, particularly
               in the context of high usage ("run rate") of equity compensation
               in the recent past; or if there are objectionable plan design and
               provisions.

<PAGE>

          -    Proposals relating to fees to outside directors, provided the
               amounts are not excessive relative to other companies in the
               country or industry, and provided that the structure is
               appropriate within the market context. While stock-based
               compensation to outside directors is positive if moderate and
               appropriately structured, we are wary of significant stock option
               awards or other performance-based awards for outside directors,
               as well as provisions that could result in significant forfeiture
               of value on a director's decision to resign from a board (such
               forfeiture can undercut director independence).

          -    Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts
               up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based
               employee plan, including all non-executive employees.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
               severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
               that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.

     2.   Shareholder proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
          agreements will not be supported, but proposals that require
          shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
          annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported. We
          generally oppose shareholder proposals that would establish arbitrary
          caps on pay. We consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder proposals
          that seek to limit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs),
          but support such proposals where we consider SERPs to be excessive.

     3.   Shareholder proposals advocating stronger and/or particular
          pay-for-performance models will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,
          with consideration of the merits of the individual proposal within the
          context of the particular company and its labor markets, and the
          company's current and past practices. While we generally support
          emphasis on long-term components of senior executive pay and strong
          linkage of pay to performance, we consider whether a proposal may be
          overly prescriptive, and the impact of the proposal, if implemented as
          written, on recruitment and retention.

     4.   We consider shareholder proposals for U.K.-style advisory votes on pay
          on a case-by-case basis.

     5.   We generally support proposals advocating reasonable senior executive
          and director stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements for
          shares gained in option exercises.

     6.   Management proposals effectively to re-price stock options are
          considered on a case-by-case basis. Considerations include the
          company's reasons and justifications for a re-pricing, the company's
          competitive position, whether senior executives and outside directors
          are excluded, potential cost to shareholders, whether the re-pricing
          or share exchange is on a value-for-value basis, and whether vesting
          requirements are extended.

H. SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. We consider proposals relating to
social, political and environmental issues on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether they will have a financial impact on shareholder value. However, we
generally vote against proposals requesting reports that are duplicative,
related to matters not material to the business, or that would impose
unnecessary or excessive costs. We may abstain from voting on proposals that do
not have a readily

<PAGE>

determinable financial impact on shareholder value. We generally oppose
proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are not required or
customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate.

I. FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM Funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

III. ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

The MSIM Proxy Review Committee (the "Committee") has overall responsibility for
creating and implementing the Policy, working with an MSIM staff group (the
"Corporate Governance Team"). The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief
Investment Officer of Global Equities ("CIO"), consists of senior investment
professionals who represent the different investment disciplines and geographic
locations of the firm. Because proxy voting is an investment responsibility and
impacts shareholder value, and because of their knowledge of companies and
markets, portfolio managers and other members of investment staff play a key
role in proxy voting, although the Committee has final authority over proxy
votes.

The Committee Chairperson is the head of the Corporate Governance Team, and is
responsible for identifying issues that require Committee deliberation or
ratification. The Corporate Governance Team, working with advice of investment
teams and the Committee, is responsible for voting on routine items and on
matters that can be addressed in line with these Policy guidelines. The
Corporate Governance Team has responsibility for voting case-by-case where
guidelines and precedent provide adequate guidance, and to refer other
case-by-case decisions to the Proxy Review Committee.

The Committee will periodically review and have the authority to amend, as
necessary, the Policy and establish and direct voting positions consistent with
the Client Proxy Standard.

A. COMMITTEE PROCEDURES

The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other matters) address any
outstanding issues relating to the Policy or its implementation. The Corporate
Governance Team will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments
and/or any additional guidelines or procedures the Committee may adopt).

The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other matters): (1)
authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain shares of the same issuer that
are the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM
portfolios to be voted differently than other shares) and/or "override voting"
(i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the Policy); (2)
review and approve upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters for which
specific direction has been provided in this Policy; and (3) determine how to
vote matters for which specific direction has not been provided in this Policy.

Members of the Committee may take into account Research Providers'
recommendations and research as well as any other relevant information they may
request or receive, including portfolio manager and/or analyst research, as
applicable. Generally, proxies related to securities held in accounts that are
managed pursuant to quantitative, index or index-like strategies ("Index
Strategies") will be voted in the same manner as those held in actively managed
accounts, unless economic interests of the accounts differ. Because accounts
managed using Index Strategies are passively managed accounts, research from
portfolio managers and/or analysts related to securities held in these accounts
may not be available. If the affected securities are held only in accounts that
are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and the proxy relates to a matter that
is not described in this Policy, the Committee will consider all available
information from the Research Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
significant, from the portfolio managers and/or analysts.

B. MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

<PAGE>

In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the Committee determines that
an issue raises a material conflict of interest, the Committee will request a
special committee to review, and recommend a course of action with respect to,
the conflict(s) in question ("Special Committee").

The Special Committee shall be comprised of the Chairperson of the Proxy Review
Committee, the Chief Compliance Officer or his/her designee, a senior portfolio
manager (if practicable, one who is a member of the Proxy Review Committee)
designated by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's relevant Chief Investment
Officer or his/her designee, and any other persons deemed necessary by the
Chairperson. The Special Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's General
Counsel or his/her designee who will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In
addition to the research provided by Research Providers, the Special Committee
may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and outside
sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

C. IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

A potential material conflict of interest could exist in the following
situations, among others:

     1.   The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an affiliate of
          MSIM and the vote is on a material matter affecting the issuer.

     2.   The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other security
          issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates except if echo voting is
          used, as with MSIM Funds, as described herein.

     3.   Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
          submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a party
          to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will be paid a
          success fee if completed).

If the Chairperson of the Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
material conflict of interest, depending on the facts and circumstances, the
Chairperson will address the issue as follows:

     1.   If the matter relates to a topic that is discussed in this Policy, the
          proposal will be voted as per the Policy.

     2.   If the matter is not discussed in this Policy or the Policy indicates
          that the issue is to be decided case-by-case, the proposal will be
          voted in a manner consistent with the Research Providers, provided
          that all the Research Providers have the same recommendation, no
          portfolio manager objects to that vote, and the vote is consistent
          with MSIM's Client Proxy Standard.

     3.   If the Research Providers' recommendations differ, the Chairperson
          will refer the matter to the Committee to vote on the proposal. If the
          Committee determines that an issue raises a material conflict of
          interest, the Committee will request a Special Committee to review and
          recommend a course of action, as described above. Notwithstanding the
          above, the Chairperson of the Committee may request a Special
          Committee to review a matter at any time as he/she deems necessary to
          resolve a conflict.

D. PROXY VOTING REPORTING

The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s), will document in
writing all of their decisions and actions, which documentation will be
maintained by the Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s), for
a period of at least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a security
held by an MSIM Fund, the Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
will report their decisions to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of
those Funds at each Board's next regularly scheduled Board meeting. The report
will contain information concerning decisions made by the Committee and Special
Committee during the most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding
the Board meeting.

<PAGE>

The Corporate Governance Team will timely communicate to applicable portfolio
managers and to ISS, decisions of the Committee and Special Committee so that,
among other things, ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client requesting it.
MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly provide a report indicating how
each proxy was voted with respect to securities held in that client's account.

MSIM's Legal Department is responsible for filing an annual Form N-PX on behalf
of each MSIM Fund for which such filing is required, indicating how all proxies
were voted with respect to such Fund's holdings.

APPENDIX A

The following procedures apply to accounts managed by Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP
("AIP").

Generally, AIP will follow the guidelines set forth in Section II of MSIM's
Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures. To the extent that such guidelines do not
provide specific direction, or AIP determines that consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard, the guidelines should not be followed, the Proxy Review
Committee has delegated the voting authority to vote securities held by accounts
managed by AIP to the Liquid Markets investment team and the Private Markets
investment team of AIP. A summary of decisions made by the investment teams will
be made available to the Proxy Review Committee for its information at the next
scheduled meeting of the Proxy Review Committee.

In certain cases, AIP may determine to abstain from determining (or
recommending) how a proxy should be voted (and therefore abstain from voting
such proxy or recommending how such proxy should be voted), such as where the
expected cost of giving due consideration to the proxy does not justify the
potential benefits to the affected account(s) that might result from adopting or
rejecting (as the case may be) the measure in question.

Waiver of Voting Rights
For regulatory reasons, AIP may either 1) invest in a class of securities of an
underlying fund (the "Fund") that does not provide for voting rights; or 2)
waive 100% of its voting rights with respect to the following:

     1.   Any rights with respect to the removal or replacement of a director,
          general partner, managing member or other person acting in a similar
          capacity for or on behalf of the Fund (each individually a "Designated
          Person," and collectively, the "Designated Persons"), which may
          include, but are not limited to, voting on the election or removal of
          a Designated Person in the event of such Designated Person's death,
          disability, insolvency, bankruptcy, incapacity, or other event
          requiring a vote of interest holders of the Fund to remove or replace
          a Designated Person; and

     2.   Any rights in connection with a determination to renew, dissolve,
          liquidate, or otherwise terminate or continue the Fund, which may
          include, but are not limited to, voting on the renewal, dissolution,
          liquidation, termination or continuance of the Fund upon the
          occurrence of an event described in the Fund's organizational
          documents; provided, however, that, if the Fund's organizational
          documents require the consent of the Fund's general partner or
          manager, as the case may be, for any such termination or continuation
          of the Fund to be effective, then AIP may exercise its voting rights
          with respect to such matter.

APPENDIX B

<PAGE>

The following procedures apply to the portion of the Van Kampen Dynamic Credit
Opportunities Fund ("VK Fund") sub advised by Avenue Europe International
Management, L.P. ("Avenue"). (The portion of the VK Fund managed solely by Van
Kampen Asset Management will continue to be subject to MSIM's Policy.)

     1.   Generally: With respect to Avenue's portion of the VK Fund, the Board
          of Trustees of the VK Fund will retain sole authority and
          responsibility for proxy voting. The Adviser's involvement in the
          voting process of Avenue's portion of the VK Fund is a purely
          administrative function, and serves to execute and deliver the proxy
          voting decisions made by the VK Fund Board in connection with the
          Avenue portion of the VK Fund, which may, from time to time, include
          related administrative tasks such as receiving proxies, following up
          on missing proxies, and collecting data related to proxies. As such,
          the Adviser shall not be deemed to have voting power or shared voting
          power with Avenue with respect to Avenue's portion of the Fund.

     2.   Voting Guidelines: All proxies, with respect to Avenue's portion of
          the VK Fund, will be considered by the VK Fund Board or such
          subcommittee as the VK Fund Board may designate from time to time for
          determination and voting approval. The VK Board or its subcommittee
          will timely communicate to MSIM's Corporate Governance Group its proxy
          voting decisions, so that among other things the votes will be
          effected consistent with the VK Board's authority.

               Administration: The VK Board or its subcommittee will meet on an
               adhoc basis as may be required from time to time to review
               proxies that require its review and determination. The VK Board
               or its subcommittee will document in writing all of its decisions
               and actions which will be maintained by the VK Fund, or its
               designee(s), for a period of at least 6 years. If a subcommittee
               is designated, a summary of decisions made by such subcommittee
               will be made available to the full VK Board for its information
               at its next scheduled respective meetings.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                  VAN KAMPEN DYNAMIC CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES FUND

                         VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Fund is managed by
members of the Adviser's Senior Loan Group, which currently includes Howard
Tiffen, Senior Adviser of the Adviser, Philip Yarrow, Executive Director and
portfolio manager of the Adviser, Gerard Fogarty, Vice President and assistant
portfolio manager of the Adviser, and Jeffrey Scott, Vice President and
assistant portfolio manager of the Adviser. Mr. Yarrow is primarily responsible
for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

Mr. Tiffen joined the Adviser in 1999 and is currently associated with the
Adviser and members of the Senior Loan Group in a senior adviser capacity. Mr.
Yarrow joined the Adviser in 2005 and began managing the Fund in July 2008.
Prior to joining the Adviser in 2005, Mr. Yarrow was a credit analyst and a
portfolio manager at Bank One/JPMorgan. Mr. Fogarty joined the Adviser in 2007
and began managing the Fund in July 2008. From 2003 to 2007 and prior to joining
the Adviser, Mr. Fogarty was employed by JP Morgan and held a number of
positions including Director in the financial institutions group, and, most
recently as a Credit Executive in the commercial real estate group. Prior to
joining JP Morgan, Mr. Fogarty was employed as an Associate in the financial
institutions group at Bank of America. Mr. Scott joined the Adviser in 2005 and
began managing the Fund in July 2008. Prior to joining the Adviser, Mr. Scott
was employed by State Farm Insurance Companies where he served as an Assistant
Vice President in the Mutual Fund Group responsible for product development and
strategy as well as a Regional Vice President for Sales for the Financial
Services Division.

<PAGE>

The composition of the team may change from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

As of July 31, 2008, Mr. Tiffen managed six registered investment companies with
a total of approximately $6 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles
other than registered investment companies; and one other account with a total
of approximately $597.7 million in assets.

As of July 31, 2008, Phillip Yarrow managed three registered investment
companies with a total of approximately $4.3 billion in assets; no pooled
investment vehicles other than registered investment companies; and no other
accounts.

As of July 31, 2008, Gerard Fogarty managed three registered investment
companies with a total of approximately $4.3 billion in assets; no pooled
investment vehicles other than registered investment companies; and no other
accounts.

As of July 31, 2008, Jeffrey Scott managed three registered investment companies
with a total of approximately $4.3 billion in assets; no pooled investment
vehicles other than registered investment companies; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manages assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio manager may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. In addition, a conflict of interest could exist to the extent the Adviser
has proprietary investments in certain accounts, where portfolio managers have
personal investments in certain accounts or when certain accounts are investment
options in the Adviser's employee benefits and/or deferred compensation plans.
The portfolio manager may have an incentive to favor these accounts over others.
If the Adviser manages accounts that engage in short sales of securities of the
type in which the Fund invests, the Adviser could be seen as harming the
performance of the Fund for the benefit of the accounts engaged in short sales
if the short sales cause the market value of the securities to fall. The Adviser
has adopted trade allocation and other policies and procedures that it believes
are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

BASE SALARY COMPENSATION. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

- -    Cash Bonus;

- -    Morgan Stanley's Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation into restricted stock units or other awards based on Morgan
     Stanley common stock that are subject to vesting and other conditions;

- -    Investment Management Alignment Plan (IMAP) awards -- a mandatory program
     that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation and notionally
     invests it in designated funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates.
     The award is subject to vesting and other conditions. Portfolio managers
     must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 100% of the IMAP
     deferral

<PAGE>

     into a combination of the designated open-end funds they manage that are
     included in the IMAP Fund menu;

- -    Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
     certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary
     year-end compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred
     amount: (1) across a range of designated investment funds, including funds
     advised by the Adviser or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley
     stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- -    Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
     pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the
     portfolio manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three-
     and five-year periods measured against an appropriate securities market
     index (or indices) for the funds/accounts managed by the portfolio manager.
     Other funds/accounts managed by the same portfolio manager may be measured
     against this same index and same rankings or ratings, if appropriate, or
     against other indices and other rankings or ratings that are deemed more
     appropriate given the size and/or style of such funds/accounts as set forth
     in such funds'/accounts' disclosure materials and guidelines. The assets
     managed by the portfolio manager in funds, pooled investment vehicles and
     other accounts are described in "Other Accounts Managed by the Portfolio
     Manager" above. Generally, the greatest weight is placed on the three- and
     five-year periods.

- -    Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles
     and other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- -    The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- -    Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- -    Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management
     Inc., and the overall performance of the investment team(s) of which the
     portfolio manager is a member.

           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

       AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005, SEPTEMBER 22, 2005, SEPTEMBER 19, 2006,
                         MAY 30, 2007 AND JUNE 5, 2008

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
     Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
