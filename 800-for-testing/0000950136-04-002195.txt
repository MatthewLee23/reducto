(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the value at the end of
the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing
the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends
and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total return does not reflect broker
commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one year
represents the average annual total return. Total return for a period of less
than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal. Total
return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for
trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may be subject
to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at April 30, 2004.

(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the value at the end of
the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing
the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends
have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment
plan. Total return does not reflect broker commissions or sales charges. Total
return for a period greater than one year represents the average annual total
return. Total return for a period of less than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal. Total
return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for
trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may be subject
to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at April 30, 2004.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2004

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal Income Fund ("Municipal"), PIMCO California Municipal Income
Fund ("California Municipal") and PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund ("New
York Municipal"), collectively referred to as the "Funds", were organized as
Massachusetts business trusts on May 10, 2001. Prior to commencing operations
on June 29, 2001, the Funds had no operations other than matters relating to
their organization and registration as non-diversified, closed-end management
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended. PA Fund Management LLC (the
"Investment Manager," formerly known as PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC),
serves as the Funds' Investment Manager and is an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P., ("ADAM"). ADAM
is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds have an
unlimited amount of no par value common stock authorized.

Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal
bonds, the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes. California
Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which pay
interest that is exempt from federal and California state income taxes. New
York Municipal invests substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which
pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York state and New York City
income taxes. The Funds will seek to avoid bonds generating interest income
which could potentially subject individuals to alternative minimum tax. The
issuers' abilities to meet their obligations may be affected by economic and
political developments in a specific state or region.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Funds'
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have
not yet occurred. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are stated at market value. The Fund's
Investments are valued daily by an independent pricing service approved by the
Board of Trustees. Prices obtained from an independent pricing service use
information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained
from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar
characteristics. Short-term investments maturing in sixty days or less are
valued at amortized cost, if their original maturity was 60 days or less or by
amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the original term
to maturity exceeded 60 days. Securities for which market quotations are not
readily available or if a development/event occurs that may significantly
impact the value of the security may be fair valued, pursuant to guidelines
established by the Board of Trustees. The prices used by the Funds to value
securities may differ from the value that would be realized if the securities
were sold. The Fund's net asset value is determined daily at the close of
regular trading (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the New York Stock
Exchange.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized daily to non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Funds intend to distribute all of their taxable income and to comply with
the other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
substantially all of their taxable ordinary income and long-term capital gains,
if any, during each calendar year, the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.
federal excise tax.

(d) FUTURES CONTRACTS

A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Funds are required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

or securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the
exchange. Pursuant to the contracts, the Funds agree to receive from or pay to
the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the
contracts. Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are
recorded by the Funds as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the
contracts are closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and
the value at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or
depreciation recorded is simultaneously reversed. The use of futures
transactions involve the risk of an imperfect correlation in the movements in
the price of futures contracts, interest rates and the underlying hedged
assets, and the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts.

(e) OPTION TRANSACTIONS

For hedging purposes, the Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options on municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements,
indexes or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or
other exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities.

The cost of securities acquired through the exercise of call options is
increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds from the securities sold through
the exercise of put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a
put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an option
written could result in the Funds purchasing a security at a price different
from the current market price.

(f) RESIDUAL INTEREST MUNICIPAL BONDS

The Funds invest in Residual Interest Tax Exempt Bonds ("RITES") whose interest
rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or
the value of an index, RITES are created by dividing the income stream provided
by the underlying bonds to create two securities, one short-term and one
long-term. The interest rate on the short-term component is reset by an index
or auction process normally every seven to 35 days. After income is paid on the
short-term securities at current rates, the residual income from the underlying
bond(s) goes to the long-term securities. Therefore, rising short-term interest
rates result in lower income for the longer-term portion, and vice versa. The
longer-term bonds may be more volatile and less liquid than other Municipal
Bonds of comparable maturity. An investment in RITES typically will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

(g) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK

The Funds declare dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. Each Fund records dividends and distributions to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either
considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do
not require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions
exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax
purposes, they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in
capital.

(h) CUSTODY CREDITS ON CASH BALANCES

The Funds benefit from an expense offset arrangement with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
and accounting agent expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income
producing securities, they would have generated income for the Funds.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER

Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the
"Agreements") with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to
each Fund. Subject to the supervision of each Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through
others selected by it, the investment activities of each Fund and the Fund's
business affairs and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,
the Investment Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly, at the annual
rate of 0.65% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order to
reduce Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to
reimburse each Fund for fees and expenses at the annual rate of 0.20% of the
Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding) from the commencement of operations
through June 30, 2006, and for a declining amount thereafter through June 30,
2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage each Fund's investments.
Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all
investment decisions with respect to each Fund's assets. The Investment Manager
(not the Funds) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in
return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.37% of each Fund's
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding). The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of the fees it is entitled to receive from the Investment
Manager, such that the Sub-Adviser will receive 0.25% of each Fund's average
daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred shares
that may be outstanding) from the commencement of the Funds' operations through
June 30, 2006, and will receive an increasing amount (not to exceed 0.37% of
each Fund's average daily net assets, including net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through June 30, 2009. The
Investment Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser $1,354,622,
$997,529 and $406,793 in connection with sub-advisory services for Municipal,
California Municipal and New York Municipal, respectively, for the year ended
April 30, 2004.

The Funds are subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Funds from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation
value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on
any matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

          New York Municipal               $0.075 per common share


7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 6, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") filed
a complaint in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York
alleging that the Investment Manager, certain of its affiliates and Stephen J.
Treadway (the chief executive officer of the Investment Manager as well as the
chairman and a trustee of the Funds) had, among other things, violated and/or
aided and abetted violations of various antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws in connection with alleged "market timing" arrangements in
certain open-end investment companies advised by the Investment Manager. The
complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest,
monetary penalties, and an order permanently enjoining the defendants from
serving as investment advisers, principal underwriters, officers, directors, or
members of any advisory boards to any registered investment companies.

The above complaint does not allege that any inappropriate activity took place
in the Funds and the Funds are not named in the complaint.

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONCLUDED)

In addition, on June 1, 2004, ADAM and certain other affiliates of the
Investment Manager entered into a consent order and final judgment with the
Attorney General of the State of New Jersey (the "NJAG") in settlement of a
lawsuit filed by the NJAG on February 17, 2004 in connection with alleged
"market timing" arrangements. Under the terms of the settlement, ADAM and
certain of its affiliates agreed to pay the State of New Jersey a civil
monetary penalty of $15 million and $3 million for investigative costs. In
addition, ADAM and certain of its affiliates agreed to make several corporate
governance changes. Also on June 1, 2004, the NJAG dismissed its claims against
the Sub-Adviser, which had been filed as part of the same lawsuit.

If the Commission (or other regulator) were to obtain a court injunction
against the Investment Manager, its affiliates or Mr. Treadway, they and their
affiliates (including the Sub-Adviser) would, in the absence of exemptive
relief granted by the Commission, be barred from serving as an investment
adviser/sub-adviser or principal underwriter for any registered investment
company, including the Funds. In such a case, the Investment Manager and the
Sub-Adviser would in turn seek exemptive relief from the Commission, as
contemplated by the Investment Company Act, although there is no assurance that
such exemptive relief would be granted. The Commission also has the power by
order to prohibit the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and their affiliates
from serving as investment advisers and underwriters, although to date it has
not exercised such powers with respect to market timing arrangements involving
other mutual fund complexes.

Since February, 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and certain of
their affiliates, various investment companies advised by the Investment
Manager and the Sub-Adviser and their trustees (including Mr. Treadway) have
been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in
the Southern District of New York, the Central District of California and the
Districts of New Jersey and Connecticut. The lawsuits have been commenced as
putative class actions on behalf of investors who purchased, held or redeemed
shares of the specified funds during specific periods or as derivative actions
on behalf of the specified funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the same
facts that are the subject of the regulatory proceedings discussed above. The
lawsuits seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages plus
interest and, in some cases, punitive damages, the rescission of investment
advisory contracts, and/or the return of fees paid under those contracts and
restitution. The Funds have been named in several class action lawsuits. The
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that other similar lawsuits may
be filed in U.S. federal or state courts naming ADAM, the Investment Manager,
the Sub-Adviser, various investment companies they advise (which may include
the Funds), their boards of trustees and/or their affiliates.

In November 2003, the Commission settled an enforcement action against an
unaffiliated broker-dealer relating to the undisclosed receipt of fees from
certain mutual fund companies in return for preferred marketing of their funds
and announced that it would be investigating mutual funds and their
distributors generally with respect to compensation arrangements relating to
the sale of mutual fund shares. In that connection, the Investment Manager, the
Sub-Adviser and certain of their affiliates are under investigation by the
Commission relating to revenue-sharing arrangements and the use of brokerage
commissions to recognize brokers effecting sales of open-end investment
companies advised by the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and their
affiliates. In addition, the Attorney General of the State of California has
publicly announced an investigation into the brokerage recognition and
revenue-sharing arrangements of these open-end investment companies.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments from these matters
could lead to a decrease in the market price of the Funds' shares or other
adverse consequences to the Funds and their shareholders. However, the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or on the Investment
Manager's or the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment
advisory services related to the Funds.

*     Commencement of operations.

**    Initial public offering price of $15.00 per share less underwriting
      discount of $0.675 per share.

+     Less than $0.005 per share.

(1)   Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
      at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current
      market price on the last day of each period reported. Dividends and
      distributions are assumed, for purposes of this calculation, to be
      reinvested at prices obtained under the Funds' dividend reinvestment
      plan. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage commissions or
      sales charges. Total investment return for a period of less than one year
      is not annualized.

(2)   Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common
      and preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common
      shareholders.

(3)   Inclusive of expenses offset by custody credits earned on cash balances
      at custodian bank. (See note 1(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).

(4)   Annualized.

(5)   During the periods indicated above the Investment Manager waived a
      portion of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in
      effect, the ratio of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets would have been 1.30% and 7.91%,
      respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2004, 1.32% and 7.89%,
      respectively for the year ended April 30, 2003 and 1.21% (annualized) and
      7.34% (annualized), respectively, for the period June 29, 2001
      (commencement of operations) through April 30, 2002.

applicable to common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the two years in the period then
ended and for the period June 29, 2001 (commencement of operations) through

we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at April 30, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRIVACY POLICY:


OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU

We consider customer privacy to be a fundamental aspect of our relationship
with clients. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
and security of our current, prospective and former clients' personal
information. We have developed policies designed to protect this
confidentiality, while allowing client needs to be served.


OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION

In the course of providing you with products and services, we may obtain
non-public personal information about you. This information may come from
sources such as account applications and other forms, from other written,
electronic or verbal correspondence, from your transactions, from your
brokerage or financial advisory firm, financial adviser or consultant, and/or
from information captured on our internet web sites.


RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY

We do not disclose any personal or account information provided by you or
gathered by us to non-affiliated third parties, except as required or permitted
by law. As is common in the industry, non-affiliated companies may from time to
time be used to provide certain services, such as preparing and mailing
prospectuses, reports, account statements and other information, conducting
research on client satisfaction, and gathering shareholder proxies. We may also
retain non-affiliated companies to market our products and enter in joint
marketing agreements with other companies. These companies may have access to
your personal and account information, but are permitted to use the information
solely to provide the specific service or as otherwise permitted by law. We may
also provide your personal and account information to your brokerage or
financial advisory firm and/or to your financial adviser or consultant.


SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

We do reserve the right to disclose or report personal information to
non-affiliated third parties in limited circumstances where we believe in good
faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or
law enforcement authorities, to protect our rights or property, or upon
reasonable request by any mutual fund in which you have chosen to invest. In
addition, we may disclose information about you or your accounts to a
non-affiliated third party at your request or if you consent in writing to the
disclosure.


SHARING INFORMATION WITH AFFILIATES

We may share client information with our affiliates in connection with
servicing your account or to provide you with information about products and
services that we believe may be of interest to you. The information we share
may include, for example, your participation in our mutual funds or other
investment programs, your ownership of certain types of accounts (such as
IRAs), or other data about your accounts. Our affiliates, in turn, are not
permitted to share your information with non-affiliated entities, except as
required or permitted by law.


IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEDURES

We take seriously the obligation to safeguard your non-public personal
information. We have implemented procedures designed to restrict access to your
non-public personal information to our personnel who need to know that
information to provide products or services to you. To guard your non-public
personal information, physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are in
place.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS TAX INFORMATION (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, requires the
Funds to advise shareholders within 60 days of the Funds' tax year end (April
30, 2004) as to the federal tax status of dividends and distributions received
by shareholders during such tax period. Accordingly, please note that
substantially all dividends paid from net investment income from the Funds
during the tax period ended April 30, 2004 were federally exempt interest
dividends. Although these Funds invested in municipal bonds containing market
discount, whose accretion is taxable. Accordingly, the percentage of dividends
paid from net investment income during the tax period which are taxable were:



Municipal                            2.00%
California Municipal                 2.06%
New York Municipal                   0.68%

Since the Funds' fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification
will be sent with respect to calendar year 2004. In January 2005, you will be
advised on IRS Form 1099 DIV as to the federal tax status of the dividends and
distributions received during calendar year 2003. The amount that will be
reported, will be the amount to use on your 2004 federal income tax return and
may differ from the amount which must be reported in connection with each
Fund's tax year ended April 30, 2004. Shareholders are advised to consult with
their tax advisers as to the federal, state and local tax status of the income
received from the Funds. In January 2005, an allocation of interest by state
will be provided which may be of value in reducing a shareholder's state or
local tax liability, if any.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pursuant to the Funds' Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all Common
Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
dividends, including any capital gain dividends, reinvested automatically in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders
(the "Plan Agent"), unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. An election
to receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the shareholder.
In the case of record shareholders such as banks, brokers or other nominees
that hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares
certified from time to time by the record shareholder as representing the total
amount registered in such shareholder's name and held for the account of
beneficial owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares
are held in the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank,
whose broker or nominee elects not to participate on the investor's behalf),
will be paid in cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder, to the
record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Fund's dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee) elects not to participate in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value on the payment
      date, the Fund will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
      value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market
      price per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2)   If Common Shares are trading below net asset value (minus estimated
      brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
      Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the Plan Agent will
      receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will purchase Common
      Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
      for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for
      the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
      purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the
      Plan Agent may exceed the market price on the payment date, resulting in
      the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had
      been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use
      all dividends and distributions received in cash to purchase Common
      Shares in the open market on or shortly after the payment date, but in no
      event later than the ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest
      will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a certificate for
each whole share in your account under the Plan and you will receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan
Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common Shares with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive distributions in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or
distributions in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open
market purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends and distributions are taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Funds and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the
Funds reserve the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable
by the participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from
the Funds' transfer agent, PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence, RI
02940-3027, telephone number 1-800-331-1710.

             Auditor's engagements for non-audit services to the when the
             engagement relates directly to the operations and financial
             reporting of the Registrant. The Registrant's policy is stated
             below.

             PIMCO Municipal Income Funds (THE "FUNDS")

AUDIT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE POLICY FOR PRE-APPROVAL OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE
INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Funds' Audit Oversight Committee ("Committee") is charged with the oversight
of the Funds' financial reporting policies and practices and their internal
controls. As part of this responsibility, the Committee must pre-approve any
independent accounting firm's engagement to render audit and/or permissible
non-audit services, as required by law. In evaluating a proposed engagement by
the independent accountants, the Committee will assess the effect that the
engagement might reasonably be expected to have on the accountant's
independence. The Committee's evaluation will be based on:

   a review of the nature of the professional services expected to provided,

   the fees to be charged in connection with the services expected to be
   provided,

   a review of the safeguards put into place by the accounting firm to safeguard
   independence, and

   periodic meetings with the accounting firm.

POLICY FOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FUNDS

On an annual basis, the Funds' Committee will review and pre-approve the scope
of the audits of the Funds and proposed audit fees and permitted non-audit
(including audit-related) services that may be performed by the Funds'
independent accountants. At least annually, the Committee will receive a report
of all audit and non-audit services that were rendered in the previous calendar
year pursuant to this Policy. In addition to the Committee's pre-approval of
services pursuant to this Policy, the engagement of the independent accounting
firm for any permitted non-audit service provided to the Funds will also require
the separate written pre-approval of the President of the Funds, who will
confirm, independently, that the accounting firms's engagement will not
adversely affect the firm's independence. All non-audit services performed by
the independent accounting firm will be disclosed, as required, in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AUDIT SERVICES

The categories of audit services and related fees to be reviewed and
pre-approved annually by the Committee are:

   Annual Fund financial statement audits
   Seed audits (related to new product filings, as required)
   SEC and regulatory filings and consents
   Semiannual financial statement reviews

AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

The following categories of audit-related services are considered to be
consistent with the role of the Fund's independent accountants and services

<PAGE>

falling under one of these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on
an annual basis if the Committee deems those services to be consistent with the
accounting firm's independence:

   Accounting consultations
   Fund merger support services
   Agreed upon procedure reports (inclusive of quarterly review of Basic
      Maintenance testing associated with issuance of Preferred Shares and
      semiannual report review)
   Other attestation reports
   Comfort letters
   Other internal control reports

Individual audit-related services that fall within one of these categories and
are not presented to the Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process
described above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting
firm's independence, by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member who
is a disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those
services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be reported to the
full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

TAX SERVICES

The following categories of tax services are considered to be consistent with
the role of the Funds' independent accountants and services falling under one of
these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on an annual basis if the
Committee deems those services to be consistent with the accounting firm's
independence:

   Tax compliance services related to the filing or amendment of the following:
      Federal, state and local income tax compliance; and, sales and use tax
         compliance
      Timely RIC qualification reviews
      Tax distribution analysis and planning
      Tax authority examination services
      Tax appeals support services
      Accounting methods studies
      Fund merger support service
      Other tax consulting services and related projects

Individual tax services that fall within one of these categories and are not
presented to the Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process described
above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting firm's
independence, by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a
disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those
services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be reported to the
full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

PROSCRIBED SERVICES

The Funds' independent accountants will not render services in the following
categories of non-audit services:

   Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
      financial statements of the Funds
   Financial information systems design and implementation
   Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or
      contribution-in-kind reports

<PAGE>

   Actuarial services
   Internal audit outsourcing services
   Management functions or human resources
   Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services
   Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit
   Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      determines, by regulation, is impermissible

PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES PROVIDED TO OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN THE FUND
COMPLEX

The Committee will pre-approve annually any permitted non-audit services to be
provided to PA Fund Management LLC (Formerly, PIMCO Advisors Fund Management
LLC) or any other investment manager to the Funds (but not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
by the investment manager) (the "Investment Manager") and any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager
that provides ongoing services to the Funds (including affiliated sub-advisers
to the Funds), provided, in each case, that the engagement relates directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Funds (such entities, including
the Investment Manager, shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting
Affiliates"). Individual projects that are not presented to the Committee as
part of the annual pre-approval process, may be pre-approved, if deemed
consistent with the accounting firm's independence, by the Committee Chairman
(or any other Committee member who is a disinterested trustee under the
Investment Company Act to whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long
as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $100,000. Any such
pre-approval shall be reported to the full Committee at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.

Although the Committee will not pre-approve all services provided to the
Investment Manager and its affiliates, the Committee will receive an annual
report from the Funds' independent accounting firm showing the aggregate fees
for all services provided to the Investment Manager and its affiliates.

DE MINIMUS EXCEPTION TO REQUIREMENT OF PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES

With respect to the provision of permitted non-audit services to a Fund or
Accounting Affiliates, the pre-approval requirement is waived if:

     (1)  The aggregate amount of all such permitted non-audit services provided
          constitutes no more than (i) with respect to such services provided to
          the Fund, five percent (5%) of the total amount of revenues paid by
          the Fund to its independent accountant during the fiscal year in which
          the services are provided, and(ii) with respect to such services
          provided to Accounting Affiliates, five percent (5%)of the total
          amount of revenues paid to the Fund's independent accountant by the
          Fund and the Accounting Affiliates during the fiscal year in which the
          services are provided;

     (2)  Such services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the
          engagement for such services to be non-audit services; and

     (3)  Such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee
          and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Committee or
          by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a
          disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
          Committee Chairman or other delegate shall be reported to the full
          Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

<PAGE>

     e)   2. No services were approved pursuant to the procedures contained in
          paragraph (C) (7) (i) (C) of Rule 2-01 of Registration S-X.

     f)   Not applicable

     g)   Non-audit fees. The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the Auditor for
          services rendered to the Registrant, and rendered to the Adviser, for
          the 2003 Reporting Period was $3,223,981 and the 2004 Reporting Period
          was $4,298,980.

     h)   Auditor Independence. The Registrant's Audit Oversight Committee has
          considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
          rendered to the Adviser which were not pre-approved is compatible with
          maintaining the Auditor's independence.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

                    PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

The following are general proxy voting policies and procedures ("Policies and
Procedures") adopted by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), an
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended ("Advisers Act").(1) PIMCO serves as the investment adviser to a wide
range of domestic and international clients, including investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and
separate investment accounts for other clients.(2) These Policies and Procedures
are adopted to ensure compliance with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act,
other applicable fiduciary obligations of PIMCO and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and
interpretations of its staff. In addition to SEC requirements governing
advisers, PIMCO's Policies and Procedures reflect the long-standing fiduciary
standards and responsibilities applicable to investment advisers with respect to
accounts subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA"), as set forth in the Department of Labor's rules and regulations.(3)

PIMCO will implement these Policies and Procedures for each of its respective
clients as required under applicable law, unless expressly directed by a client
in writing to refrain from voting that client's proxies. PIMCO's authority to
vote proxies on behalf of its clients is established by its advisory contracts,
comparable documents or by an overall delegation of discretionary authority over
its client's assets. Recognizing that proxy voting is a rare event in the realm
of fixed income investing and is typically limited to solicitation of consent to
changes in features of debt securities, these Policies and Procedures also apply
to any voting rights and/or consent rights of PIMCO, on behalf of its clients,
with respect to debt securities, including but not limited to, plans of
reorganization, and waivers and consents under applicable indentures.(4)


- -----------

(1)  These Policies and Procedures are adopted by PIMCO pursuant to Rule
     206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act, effective August 6, 2003. See Proxy Voting
     by Investment Advisers, IA Release No. 2106 (January 31, 2003).

(2)  These Policies and Procedures address proxy voting considerations under
     U.S. law and regulations and do not address the laws or requirements of
     other jurisdictions.

(3)  Department of Labor Bulletin 94-2, 29 C.F.R. 2509.94-2 (July 29, 1994). If
     a client is subject to ERISA, PIMCO will be responsible for voting proxies
     with respect to the client's account, unless the client has expressly
     retained the right and obligation to vote the proxies, and provided prior
     written notice to PIMCO of this retention.

(4)  For purposes of these Policies and Procedures, proxy voting includes any
     voting rights, consent rights or other voting authority of PIMCO on behalf
     of its clients.

<PAGE>

Set forth below are PIMCO's Policies and Procedures with respect to any voting
or consent rights of advisory clients over which PIMCO has discretionary voting
authority. These Policies and Procedures may be revised from time to time.

GENERAL STATEMENTS OF POLICY

These Policies and Procedures are designed and implemented in a manner
reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in
the best interests of PIMCO's clients. Each proxy is voted on a case-by-case
basis taking into consideration any relevant contractual obligations as well as
other relevant facts and circumstances.

PIMCO may abstain from voting a client proxy under the following circumstances:
(1) when the economic effect on shareholders' interests or the value of the
portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant; or (2) when the cost of
voting the proxies outweighs the benefits.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

PIMCO seeks to resolve any material conflicts of interest by voting in good
faith in the best interest of its clients. If a material conflict of interest
should arise, PIMCO will seek to resolve such conflict in the client's best
interest by pursuing any one of the following courses of action:

         1.  convening an ad-hoc committee to assess and resolve the
             conflict;(5)

         2.  voting in accordance with the instructions/consent of a client
             after providing notice of and disclosing the conflict to that
             client;

         3.  voting the proxy in accordance with the recommendation of an
             independent third-party service provider;

         4.  suggesting that the client engage another party to determine how
             the proxies should be voted;

         5.  delegating the vote to an independent third-party service provider;
             or

         6.  voting in accordance with the factors discussed in these Policies
             and Procedures.

PIMCO will document the process of resolving any identified material conflict of
interest.

- -----------

(5)  Any committee must be comprised of personnel who have no direct interest in
     the outcome of the potential conflict.

                                        2
<PAGE>

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY VOTING RECORDS

Except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise approved by PIMCO,
PIMCO will not disclose to third parties how it voted a proxy on behalf of a
client. However, upon request from an appropriately authorized individual, PIMCO
will disclose to its clients or the entity delegating the voting authority to
PIMCO for such clients (e.g., trustees or consultants retained by the client),
how PIMCO voted such client's proxy. In addition, PIMCO provides its clients
with a copy of these Policies and Procedures or a concise summary of these
Policies and Procedures: (i) in Part II of Form ADV; (ii) together with a
periodic account statement in a separate mailing; or (iii) any other means as
determined by PIMCO. The summary will state that these Policies and Procedures
are available upon request and will inform clients that information about how
PIMCO voted that client's proxies is available upon request.

PIMCO RECORD KEEPING

PIMCO or its agent maintains proxy voting records as required by Rule 204-2(c)
of the Advisers Act. These records include: (1) a copy of all proxy voting
policies and procedures; (2) proxy statements (or other disclosures accompanying
requests for client consent) received regarding client securities (which may be
satisfied by relying on obtaining a copy of a proxy statement from the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system or a third
party provided that the third party undertakes to provide a copy promptly upon
request); (3) a record of each vote cast by PIMCO on behalf of a client; (4) a
copy of any document created by PIMCO that was material to making a decision on
how to vote proxies on behalf of a client or that memorializes the basis for
that decision; and (5) a copy of each written client request for proxy voting
records and any written response from PIMCO to any (written or oral) client
request for such records. Additionally, PIMCO or its agent maintains any
documentation related to an identified material conflict of interest.

Proxy voting books and records are maintained by PIMCO or its agent in an easily
accessible place for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal year
during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in the
offices of PIMCO or its agent.

REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT

PIMCO's proxy voting procedures are described below. PIMCO's Compliance Group
will provide for the supervision and periodic review, no less than on a
quarterly basis, of its proxy voting activities and the implementation of these
Policies and Procedures.

Because PIMCO has contracted with State Street Investment Manager Solutions, LLC
("IMS West") to perform portfolio accounting, securities processing and
settlement processing on behalf of PIMCO, certain of the following procedures
involve IMS West in administering and implementing the proxy voting process. IMS
West will review and monitor the proxy voting process to ensure that proxies are
voted on a timely basis.

                                        3
<PAGE>

         1. Transmit Proxy to PIMCO. IMS West will forward to PIMCO's Middle
Office Group each proxy received from registered owners of record (e.g.,
custodian bank or other third party service providers).

         2. Conflicts of Interest. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each
proxy to determine whether there may be a material conflict between PIMCO and
its client. As part of this review, the group will determine whether the issuer
of the security or proponent of the proposal is a client of PIMCO, or if a
client has actively solicited PIMCO to support a particular position. If no
conflict exists, this group will forward each proxy to the appropriate portfolio
manager for consideration. However, if a conflict does exist, PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will seek to resolve any such conflict in accordance with these
Policies and Procedures.

         3. Vote. The portfolio manager will review the information, will vote
the proxy in accordance with these Policies and Procedures and will return the
voted proxy to PIMCO's Middle Office Group.

         4. Review. PIMCO's Middle Office Group will review each proxy that was
submitted to and completed by the appropriate portfolio manager. PIMCO's Middle
Office Group will forward the voted proxy back to IMS West with the portfolio
manager's decision as to how it should be voted.

         5. Transmittal to Third Parties. IMS West will document the portfolio
manager's decision for each proxy received from PIMCO's Middle Office Group in a
format designated by the custodian bank or other third party service provider.
IMS West will maintain a log of all corporate actions, including proxy voting,
which indicates, among other things, the date the notice was received and
verified, PIMCO's response, the date and time the custodian bank or other third
party service provider was notified, the expiration date and any action taken.

         6. Information Barriers. Certain entities controlling, controlled by,
or under common control with PIMCO ("Affiliates") may be engaged in banking,
investment advisory, broker-dealer and investment banking activities. PIMCO
personnel and PIMCO's agents are prohibited from disclosing information
regarding PIMCO's voting intentions to any Affiliate. Any PIMCO personnel
involved in the proxy voting process who are contacted by an Affiliate regarding
the manner in which PIMCO or its delegate intend to vote on a specific issue
must terminate the contact and notify the Compliance Group immediately.

CATEGORIES OF PROXY VOTING ISSUES

In general, PIMCO reviews and considers corporate governance issues related to
proxy matters and generally supports proposals that foster good corporate
governance practices. PIMCO considers each proposal on a case-by-case basis,
taking into consideration various factors and all relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. PIMCO may vote proxies as recommended by
management on routine matters related to the operation of the issuer and on
matters not expected to have a significant economic impact on the issuer and/or
shareholders, because PIMCO believes the recommendations by the issuer generally
are in shareholders' best

                                       4
<PAGE>

interests, and therefore in the best economic interest of PIMCO's clients. The
following is a non-exhaustive list of issues that may be included in proxy
materials submitted to clients of PIMCO, and a non-exhaustive list of factors
that PIMCO may consider in determining how to vote the client's proxies.

         BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         1. Independence. PIMCO may consider the following factors when voting
on director independence issues: (i) majority requirements for the board and the
audit, nominating, compensation and/or other board committees; and (ii) whether
the issuer adheres to and/or is subject to legal and regulatory requirements.

         2. Director Tenure and Retirement. PIMCO may consider the following
factors when voting on limiting the term of outside directors: (i) the
introduction of new viewpoints on the board; (ii) a reasonable retirement age
for the outside directors; and (iii) the impact on the board's stability and
continuity.

         3. Nominations in Elections. PIMCO may consider the following factors
when voting on uncontested elections: (i) composition of the board; (ii) nominee
availability and attendance at meetings; (iii) any investment made by the
nominee in the issuer; and (iv) long-term corporate performance and the price of
the issuer's securities.

         4. Separation of Chairman and CEO Positions. PIMCO may consider the
following factors when voting on proposals requiring that the positions of
chairman of the board and the chief executive officer not be filled by the same
person: (i) any potential conflict of interest with respect to the board's
ability to review and oversee management's actions; and (ii) any potential
effect on the issuer's productivity and efficiency.

         5. D&O Indemnification and Liability Protection. PIMCO may consider the
following factors when voting on proposals that include director and officer
indemnification and liability protection: (i) indemnifying directors for conduct
in the normal course of business; (ii) limiting liability for monetary damages
for violating the duty of care; (iii) expanding coverage beyond legal expenses
to acts that represent more serious violations of fiduciary obligation than
carelessness (e.g. negligence); and (iv) providing expanded coverage in cases
where a director's legal defense was unsuccessful if the director was found to
have acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed was
in the best interests of the company.

         6. Stock Ownership. PIMCO may consider the following factors when
voting on proposals on mandatory share ownership requirements for directors: (i)
the benefits of additional vested interest in the issuer's stock; (ii) the
ability of a director to fulfill his duties to the issuer regardless of the

          CODE OF ETHICS PURSUANT TO SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY
            ACT OF 2002 FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS

                               SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics (this "Code") pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been adopted by the registered investment
companies (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") listed on Exhibit A and
applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of whom is
identified in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
             actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
             professional relationships;

         o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
             reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the
             Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
             communications made by a Fund;

         o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
             regulations;

         o   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
             appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ANY ACTUAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS
     OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
relevant Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the relevant Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the relevant Fund and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions

<PAGE>

and procedures in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations
thereunder, the "1940 Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (including
the regulations thereunder, the "Investment Advisers Act"). Indeed, conflicts of
interest are endemic for certain registered management investment companies and
those conflicts are both substantially and procedurally dealt with under the
1940 Act. For example, Covered Officers may not engage in certain transactions
with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of such Fund. The
compliance program of each Fund and the compliance programs of its investment
advisers (including sub-advisers), principal underwriter and administrator or
sub-administrator (each a "Service Provider" and, collectively, the "Service
Providers") are reasonably designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of many of those provisions, although they are not designed to
provide absolute assurance as to those matters. This Code does not, and is not
intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts
fall outside of the parameters of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Fund and its Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether for the Funds or
for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Service Providers
and the Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationships between the Funds and their Service
Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the relevant Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, other
applicable law and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities
will be deemed to have been handled ethically. Frequently, the 1940 Act
establishes, as a mechanism for dealing with conflicts, disclosure to and
approval by the Directors/Trustees of a Fund who are not "interested persons" of
such Fund under the 1940 Act. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes and that such service, by itself, does not give rise to a conflict of
interest.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not the subject of provisions of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should bear in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the relevant Fund, unless the personal interest has been disclosed
to and approved by other officers of such Fund or such Fund's Board or a
committee of such Fund's Board that has no such personal interest.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o   use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
             influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
             relevant Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally
             to the detriment of such Fund;

         o   cause the relevant Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
             the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
             the benefit such Fund; or

         o   retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
             Funds or their Service Providers for reports of potential
             violations that are made in good faith.

         There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the President of the relevant Fund (or, with respect to activities
of the President, by the Chairman of the relevant Fund). These conflict of
interest situations are listed below:

         o   service on the board of directors or governing board of a publicly
             traded entity;

         o   acceptance of any investment opportunity or of any material gift or
             gratuity from any person or entity that does business, or desires
             to do business, with the relevant Fund. For these purposes,
             material gifts do not include (i) gifts from a single giver so long
             as their aggregate annual value does not exceed the equivalent of
             $100.00 or (ii) attending business meals, business related
             conferences, sporting events and other entertainment events at the
             expense of a giver, so long as the expense is reasonable and both
             the Covered Person and the giver are present.(1)

         o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
             relationship with, any entities doing business with the relevant
             Fund, other than a Service Provider or an affiliate of a Service
             Provider. This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit
             the ownership of publicly traded securities so long as the Covered
             Person's ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the outstanding
             securities of the relevant class.

         o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
             charges or spreads paid by the relevant Fund for effecting
             portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
             than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment with
             a Service Provider or its affiliate. This restriction shall not
             apply to or otherwise limit the ownership of

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

             publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's
             ownership does not exceed more than 2% of the particular class of
             security outstanding.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o   no Covered Officer should knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
             to misrepresent, facts about the relevant Fund to others, whether
             within or outside such Fund, including to such Fund's Board and
             auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
             organizations;

         o   each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
             area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
             of the Funds and the Service Providers or with counsel to the Funds
             with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
             understandable disclosure in the registration statements or
             periodic reports that the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
             (which, for sake of clarity, does not include any sales literature,
             omitting prospectuses, or "tombstone" advertising prepared by the
             relevant Fund's principal underwriter(s)); and

         o   it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
             compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
             applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
             becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the relevant Fund
             that he has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o   provide full and fair responses to all questions asked in any
             Trustee and Officer Questionnaire provided by the relevant Fund as
             well as with respect to any supplemental request for information;
             and

         o   notify the President of the relevant Fund promptly if he is
             convinced to a moral certainty that there has been a material
             violation of this Code (with respect to violations by a President,
             the Covered Officer shall report to the Chairman of the relevant
             Fund).

         The President of each Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by the President will be considered by the Chairman
of the relevant Fund.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         o   the President will take all appropriate action to investigate any
             potential material violations reported to him, which actions may
             include the use of internal or external counsel, accountants or
             other personnel;

         o   if, after such investigation, the President believes that no
             material violation has occurred, the President is not required to
             take any further action;

         o   any matter that the President believes is a material violation will
             be reported to the Committee;

         o   if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it
             will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
             consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
             appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures;
             notification to appropriate personnel of a Service Provider or its
             board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

         o   the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems
             appropriate; and

         o   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
             required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are
subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their Service
Providers's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Service
Providers's more detailed compliance policies and procedures are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

         Any material amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit
A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone except as permitted by the Board.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
