General Information (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund

     The investment  objective of the Fund is to outperform  over the long term,
on a total return basis (including appreciation and dividends),  the Tokyo Stock
Price Index ("TOPIX"), a composite  market-capitalization  weighted index of all
common stocks listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange  ("TSE").
The Fund seeks to achieve its  investment  objective by investing  substantially
all of its assets in equity  securities of companies listed on the TSE or listed
on the  over-the-counter  market in Japan or listed on other stock  exchanges in
Japan.  Daiwa SB  Investments  (U.S.A.) Ltd. is the Fund's  Investment  Manager.
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. is the Fund's Investment Adviser.  The Fund implements
an "active"  portfolio  management  policy,  which is an approach  that involves
quantitative  valuation of  securities  to identify an  appropriate  universe of
securities  from which to select  investments,  with  judgmental  analysis  then
applied to this universe to determine the actual  investments  to be made by the
Fund.

Shareholder Information

     The Fund's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE").  The
Fund  understands  that its shares may trade  periodically on certain  exchanges

Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan

     A Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") is available to
provide  Shareholders with automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gain
distributions  in  additional  Fund  shares.  The Plan also  allows  you to make
optional  annual  cash  investments  in Fund shares  through  the Plan Agent.  A
brochure fully  describing the Plan's terms and conditions is available from the
Plan Agent by calling (866) 669-9904 or by writing The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc.,
c/o the American Stock  Transfer & Trust  Company,  59 Maiden Lane, New York, NY
10038.

A brief summary of the material aspects of the Plan follows:

     Who can participate in the Plan? If you wish to participate and your shares
are held in your name, you may elect to become a direct  participant in the Plan
by completing and mailing the Enrollment Authorization form on the back cover of
the Dividend  Reinvestment  and Cash Purchase Plan Brochure  available  from the
Plan Agent.  However,  if your shares are held in the name of a brokerage  firm,
bank or nominee,  you should instruct your nominee to participate in the Plan on
your behalf.  If your nominee is unable to  participate in the Plan for you, you
should  request  that your shares be  registered  in your name,  so that you may
elect to participate directly in the Plan.

     May I withdraw  from the Plan? If your shares are held in your name and you
wish to receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash rather than
in  shares,  you may  withdraw  from the  Plan  without  penalty  at any time by
contacting  the Plan Agent.  If your shares are held in nominee name, you should
be able to  withdraw  from the Plan  without  a penalty  at any time by  sending
written  notice to your  nominee.  If you  withdraw,  you or your  nominee  will
receive a share  certificate for all full shares or, if you wish, the Plan Agent
will  sell  your  shares  and send you the  proceeds,  after  the  deduction  of
brokerage commissions. The Plan Agent will convert any fractional shares to cash
at the then-current market price and send to you a check for the proceeds.

     How are the dividends and distributions  reinvested? If the market price of
the Fund's  shares on the payment  date should  equal or exceed  their net asset
value per  share,  the Fund will  issue new  shares to you at the  higher of net
asset value or 95% of the  then-current  market  price.  If the market  price is
lower than net asset  value per share,  the Fund will issue new shares to you at
the market price. If the dividends or distributions  are declared and payable as
cash only,  you will receive  shares  purchased for you by the Plan Agent on the
NYSE or otherwise on the open market to the extent available.

     What is the Cash Purchase feature? The Plan participants have the option of
making annual  investments in Fund shares through the Plan Agent. You may invest
any amount from $100 to $3,000 annually. The Plan Agent will purchase shares for
you on the NYSE or  otherwise  on the open market on or about  February  15th of
each year. Plan participants  should send voluntary cash payments to be received
by the Plan Agent  approximately  ten days before the annual  purchase date. The
Plan Agent will return any cash payments received more than thirty days prior to
the purchase date. You may withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written  notice,
if the  notice is  received  by the Plan Agent not less that two  business  days
before the purchase date.

     Is there a cost to  participate?  There are no Plan  charges  or  brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the Fund.  However,  each participant will
pay a pro rata portion of brokerage commissions for shares purchased on the NYSE
or on the open market by the Plan Agent.

     What are the tax implications?  The automatic reinvestment of dividends and
distributions  does not  relieve  you of any income tax which may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends and distributions.  In addition,  the
Plan  Agent  will  reinvest  dividends  for  foreign  participants  and  for any
participant  subject to federal  backup  withholding  after the deduction of the
amounts required to be withheld.

     Please  note  that,  if you  participate  in the Plan  through a  brokerage
account,  you may not be able to continue as a participant if you transfer those
shares to another  broker.  Contact  your broker or nominee or the Plan Agent to
ascertain what is the best arrangement for you to participate in the Plan.

Shareholder Letter (unaudited)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              November 16, 2005

Dear Shareholders:

     It is our  pleasure  on behalf of the Board of  Directors  to  present  the
Annual  Report for The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2005.

Performance  and Review of the Japanese  Stock Market  (November  2004 - October
2005)

     For the year ended  October 31,  2005,  stock  markets in Japan showed good
performance.  The total  return of the TOPIX  Index  ("TOPIX")  was 34% over the
period in local currency terms. The TOPIX hit bottom in April 2003 at 770 points
and bounced  strongly to finish 2003 at around 1000  points.  The TOPIX  climbed
further in early 2004, to reach 1200 points in April 2004, then largely moved in
the range  between 1100 points and 1200 points  until the end of July 2005.  The
TOPIX rose further over the quarter ended October 31, 2005 and it closed at 1445
points on October 31, 2005.

     Economic  fundamentals were supportive to companies in Japan. Over the past
year,  the  Japanese  economy  was on a steady  upward  trend.  Real term  Gross
Domestic Product ("GDP") increased 0.1% in the October to December 2004 quarter,
1.5% in the  January  to March  2005  quarter,  0.8% in the  April to June  2005
quarter,  and 0.4% in the July to  September  2005  quarter  (quarter-on-quarter
basis,  not  annualized).  Economies in the Americas,  Europe and Asia,  where a
large number of Japanese companies have extensive exposure, were generally doing
fine. The fast growing Chinese  economy  offered an alternative  production base
and some new markets for Japanese  companies,  as well as some new  competition.
The rise in natural resource prices, most starkly illustrated by the rise in the
price of oil, had a substantial effect on the operations of Japanese  companies.
Some  companies  suffered from rising  material  prices,  but others  benefited.
Higher oil prices drove up the costs for chemical producers, for example. At the
same time, trading houses benefited from higher natural resource prices, as they
succeeded  in raising  sales prices more than their cost  increase.  The Bank of
Japan continued its  "zero-interest-policy"  keeping  short-term  interest rates
minimal,  while the yield on the 10-year  government  bond stayed mostly between
1.2% and 1.6%.  The popular  Prime  Minister  Koizumi,  who has been running the
government since April 2001,  continued to push his reform policy toward smaller
government and more privatization of  once-government-run  organizations.  Prime
Minister Koizumi also changed many of the old-fashioned procedures that remained
in Japanese politics.

     Looking at stock market developments,  the steel, banking,  insurance, real
estate and metal sectors were the top  performing  sectors,  while the paper and
pulp,  airline and  telecommunication  sectors  performed  the worst  during the
one-year period ended October 31, 2005.  Steel producers  benefited from a surge
in steel demand,  after years of slump.  The sudden  increase in steel demand in
Asia,  particularly  in China,  helped  steel makers  increase  output and raise
prices,  more than  offsetting  the  cost-rise  of the  inputs  and fuel.  Banks
performed  well over the year, as investors  grew more  confident and optimistic
about their profitability and the once-quite-questionable state of their balance
sheet.  Consolidation  of the  industry  by mergers  among banks was also viewed
positively.  Insurers  performed well,  too. They were hit by natural  disasters
such as earthquakes and typhoons,  but investors seemed to have found more value
in the likely return from insurers' investments. In the central city areas, land
prices finally  started to rise. Land prices have been in decline all over Japan
from the peak of the "bubble  economy" in 1990.  Seeing the signs of turn-around
in land prices,  stocks of real estate operators performed well. The development
of  securitization in 4 real estate investment helped the revival of real estate
operators.  On the other hand, the paper industry in Japan  encountered  renewed
tough competition,  even after sizable  consolidation a few years ago, resulting
in profit  deterioration  at paper makers and poor  performance of paper stocks.
Airlines  in  Japan  suffered,  as was  the  case  with  many of  their  foreign
competitors,  from tough  competition  and high fuel  prices.  Telecommunication
operators and information  technology service providers were also hurt by severe
competition, resulting in a slump in share prices.

     Examples of top performers and bottom  performers  among the major names in
the TOPIX are as follows:

     The share price of Sumitomo  Metal  Industries  more than  trebled over the
period.  It performed best among major  stocks--its  steel  production  business
enjoyed buoyant  demand,  with an extra upside in its seamless pipes for oil and
gas industries.  Kobe Steel was also one of the top performers with 130% return.
Specialty   retailers  performed  well.  Yamada  Denki  (a  consumer  electronic
retailing chain), Isetan (a department store with strength in fashion items) and
Shimamura  (a retail  chain of  reasonably  priced  clothes)  were all among top
performers.  Shares of Yamada Denki gained 170%,  Isetan  shares  gained 93% and
Shimamura  shares gained 92% over the period.  Shares of financial  institutions
also  performed  well.  Juroku Bank returned 128%,  Aioi  Insurance 92%,  Resona
Holdings  91%,  Mitsui Trust 91% and Mizuho  Financial  Group 89%. All benefited
from a more optimistic view of the Japanese financial market. On the other hand,
companies in the  electronics and information  technology  industries  performed
poorly.  Shares in Net-One Systems, an IT system integrator declined by 45% over
the year because  expected  profit  growth did not  materialize  as  competition
remained tough. NEC Electronics'  shares lost 40%, because its IC chips suffered
from tough price  competition,  while  shares in  SkyPerfect  Communications,  a
satellite TV operator, declined by 35%.

Comment

     As shown in Table 1, the net asset value  ("NAV") of the Fund  increased by
25.22% in USD terms  during the twelve  months from  November 1, 2004 to October
31, 2005. Over the same period,  the Fund's  benchmark  (TOPIX) gained 22.10% in
USD terms. The depreciation of the JPY against the USD was a negative factor for
the absolute NAV return measured in USD.

     Table 2 shows that the  performance of the equity portion of the portfolio,
excluding  expenses  and some  cash  positions  in JPY  terms,  was  39.86%,  in
comparison with 34.60% for the benchmark, indicating out-performance of 5.26% on
this basis.

Attribution Analysis Throughout the Period

Tables 4 and 5.  (Stock Selection)

     The attribution analysis indicates that a sizable positive contribution was
made in Retailing (+1.74%),  Telecommunication & Information  Services (+0.88%),
and Other Finance (+0.58%)  sectors.  Negative  contributions in stock selection
mostly  came  from  Wholesale  Trade  (-0.41%),  Food  (-0.39%)  and the Glass &
Ceramics  (-0.36%)  sectors.  The total stock selection  contribution was +5.21%
over the period.

     Major positive  contributors were Sundrug (+1.02%,  a specialty  retailer),
Shimamura  (+0.70%,  a  specialty  retailer),  Mitsubishi  UFJ  Financial  Group
(+0.67%, a banking group),  Tokuyama (+0.59%, a specialty chemical producer) and
Orix (+0.55%,  a leasing  company).  Major  negative  contributors  were Net-One
Systems  (-0.69%,  a computer  system  integrator),  Sharp  (-0.59%,  a maker of
consumer  electronics  products)  and  TDK  (-0.48%,  an  electronic  components
producer).

(Sector Selection)

     The  attribution  analysis  shows  that  an  underweight  position  in  the
Communication sector resulted in a positive contribution  (+0.41%),  while there
were negative  contributions from an overweight position in Electronics (-0.39%)
and an underweight position in Wholesale Trade (-0.32%).

Outlook & Strategy

     Investors were quite active in the Japanese stock market, particularly from
the summer of 2005.  Foreign investors  continued to be major buyers of Japanese
stocks from the spring onwards,  while domestic individual  investors were quite
active  participants.  The Japanese stock market grew  relatively more volatile.
Stock price movement of individual stocks also grew volatile,  particularly from
the summer of 2005.  One  obvious  focus of market  participants  is whether the
rising trend of natural  resource  prices,  most notably observed in oil prices,
has reversed after a long-lasting up-trend.  Another focus would be the strength
of the U.S.  economy after natural  disasters.  Much concern has been  expressed
about the housing  market boom in the United States in view of the potential for
continuing  interest rate increases.  In Japan,  the rebound of the economy over
the last few years was  driven by the  corporate  sector.  Signs of a pick-up in
retail  consumption have been observed in 2005,  finally.  The Japanese domestic
economy could enjoy a prolonged expansionary phase, if the driver of the economy
shifts smoothly to personal consumption from certain cyclical sectors that could
face  downturn.  Over the long term,  we expect a healthy  return from  Japanese
stock  markets as of now.  The reasons  are:  1)  fundamentals  of the  Japanese
economy has much  improved  and it is in good  condition,  2) a large  number of
companies in Japan have overcome  troubles and are well  positioned to earn good
profits in total,  and 3) valuation of stocks  remain quite  reasonable.  At the
same time, we are careful about the state of the global economy,  housing market
condition in the U.S. and Japan, and possible  external shocks to economies.  We
will  keep  our  focus  on the  fundamentals  of the  companies  with  unchanged
attention to the quality of earnings.

Fund Performance

     During the year ended October 31, 2005,  the Fund's market price on the New
York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE")  ranged from a low of $5.73 per share on April 18,
2005 to a high of $8.88 on October 4, 2005.  The Fund's NYSE market price closed
at $8.51 per share on October 31, 2005.

     The NYSE trading price in relation to the Fund's net asset value per share,
as measured by the weekly closing prices during the year ended October 31, 2005,
ranged from a high  discount of 9.26% on May 12, 2005 to a high premium of 9.41%
on October 20, 2005, and ended the period at a premium of 9.24%.

     The  Fund has not  invested  in  derivative  securities.  Although  foreign
currency hedging is permitted by the Fund's prospectus, the Fund has not engaged
in any foreign currency hedging.

Notes to Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

     The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Maryland on
July 12, 1990 under its former name "The Japan Emerging  Equity Fund,  Inc." and
commenced  operations on July 24, 1992. It is registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a closed-end, diversified management investment company.

     The  following  significant  accounting  policies  are in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in the United States of America for
investment companies. Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual reporting  results
could differ from those estimates.

     Valuation  of  Investments--Securities  which are listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange  or listed on the  over-the-counter  market in Japan or listed on other
exchanges in Japan and for which market  quotations  are readily  available  are
valued at the last  reported  sales price  available to the Fund at the close of
business on the day the  securities are being valued or, lacking any such sales,
at the last available bid price. In instances  where  quotations are not readily
available or where the price as determined by the above procedures is deemed not
to represent fair market value,  fair value will be determined in such manner as
the Board of Directors  (the  "Board")  may  prescribe.  Short-term  investments
having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost,  except where
the Board  determines  that such  valuation does not represent the fair value of
the  investment.  All other  securities  and  assets are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board.

     Foreign  Currency  Translation--The  books  and  records  of the  Fund  are
maintained in U.S. dollars as follows:  (1) the foreign currency market value of
investment  securities and other assets and  liabilities  stated in Japanese yen
are  translated at the exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period;  and
(2) purchases, sales, income and expenses are translated at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.  The resulting exchange
gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations.  The Fund does not
isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign  exchange rates from the effect of
fluctuations in the market price of securities.

     Tax Status--The Fund intends to continue to distribute substantially all of
its  taxable  income  and to  comply-with  the  minimum  distribution  and other
requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment
companies.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for federal  income or excise  taxes is
required.

     The Fund is not  subject to any  Japanese  income,  capital  gains or other
taxes except for withholding taxes on certain-income, generally imposed at rates
of 10% on interest and dividends, paid to the Fund by Japanese corporations.


<PAGE>


Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Investment Transactions and Investment Income--Investment  transactions are
recorded  on the trade  date  (the  date upon  which the order to buy or sell is
executed).  Realized and  unrealized  gains and losses from security and foreign
currency  transactions  are  calculated on the identified  cost basis.  Dividend
income and corporate actions are recorded  generally on the ex-date,  except for
certain  dividends and corporate  actions from Japanese  securities which may be
recorded after the ex-date, as soon as the Fund acquires  information  regarding
such dividends or corporate  actions.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual
basis.

     Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders--The Fund records dividends and
distributions payable to its shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of
dividends and distributions  from net investment income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance  with federal income tax  regulations,  which
may differ from generally accepted accounting  principles.  These book basis/tax
basis differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the
extent these differences are permanent in nature,  such amounts are reclassified
within  the  capital  accounts  based  on their  federal  tax  basis  treatment;
temporary   differences   do  not  require   reclassifications.   Dividends  and
distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in-capital.

Investment Manager and Investment Adviser

     The Fund has an Investment  Management  Agreement with Daiwa SB Investments
(U.S.A.)  Ltd.  (the  "Manager").  Daiwa  SB  Investments  Ltd.  ("DSBI"  or the
"Adviser"),  an affiliate of the Manager,  acts as the Fund's investment adviser
pursuant to an Investment  Advisory  Agreement between the Manager and DSBI. For
such investment services, the Fund is obligated to pay the Manager a monthly fee
at an  annual  rate of 0.60% of the  first  $20  million,  0.40% of the next $30
million and 0.20% of the excess over $50  million of the Fund's  average  weekly
net assets,  of which fee 60% is paid by the Manager to DSBI.  In addition,  the
Fund has agreed to reimburse  the Manager and the Adviser for all  out-of-pocket
expenses  related to the Fund. For the year ended October 31, 2005,  expenses of
$6,263 were paid to the Adviser,  representing  reimbursement  to the Adviser of
costs  relating to the  attendance  by its  employees  at meetings of the Fund's
Board.

         At October 31, 2005, the Fund owed $30,412 to the Manager.

     Brokerage  commissions of $31,347 were paid by the Fund to Daiwa Securities
America,  Inc., an affiliate of both the Manager and DSBI,  in  connection  with
portfolio transactions during the year ended October 31, 2005.

Administrator and Custodian and Other Related Parties

     Daiwa  Securities  Trust  Company  ("DSTC"),  an  affiliate of the Adviser,
provides certain administrative services to the Fund, for which the Fund pays to
DSTC a monthly  fee at an annual  rate of 0.20% of the first $60  million of the
Fund's average weekly net assets, 0.15% of the next $40 million and 0.10% of the
excess over $100 million, with a minimum annual fee of $120,000. In addition, as
permitted by the Administration Agreement, the Fund reimburses the Administrator
for its  out-of-pocket  expenses related to the Fund. For the year ended October
31,  2005,  expenses  of  $6,072  were paid to the  Administrator,  representing
reimbursement  to the  Administrator  of costs relating to the attendance by its
employees at meetings of the Fund's Board.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     DSTC  also  acts as  custodian  for the  Fund's  assets  and has  appointed
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation-(the  "Sub-Custodian"),  an affiliate of the
Manager,  to act as the  sub-custodian for all of the cash and securities of the
Fund held in Japan. As compensation for its services as custodian, DSTC receives
a monthly fee and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Such expenses include
fees and  out-of-pocket  expenses  of the  Sub-Custodian.  During the year ended
October  31,  2005,  DSTC and the  Sub-Custodian  earned  $50,187  and  $80,810,
respectively, as compensation for custodial service to the Fund.

     At October 31, 2005,  the Fund owed $16,055,  $3,833 and $4,810 to DSTC for
administration,  compliance and custodian fees, respectively, excluding fees and
expenses of $8,807 payable to the Sub-Custodian.

     During the year ended  October 31, 2005,  the Fund paid or accrued  $67,033
for legal services in connection  with the Fund's  on-going  operations to a law
firm of which the Fund's Assistant Secretary is a partner.

Investments in Securities and Federal Income Tax Matters

     For federal  income tax purposes,  the cost of securities  owned at October
31, 2005 was $86,379,720.  At October 31, 2005, the net unrealized  appreciation
of investments for federal income tax purposes, excluding short-term securities,
of  $22,518,378  was composed of gross  appreciation  of  $23,514,470  for those
investments  having an excess of value  over  cost,  and gross  depreciation  of
$996,092 for those investments having an excess of cost over value. For the year
ended  October  31,  2005,  total  aggregate  purchases  and sales of  portfolio
securities,  excluding short-term securities,  were $68,677,580 and $70,686,021,
respectively.

     In order to present undistributed net investment income and accumulated net
realized loss on  investments  on the Statement of Assets and  Liabilities  that
more closely represent their tax character,  certain  adjustments have been made
to paid-in capital in excess of par value,  undistributed  net investment income
and accumulated net realized loss on investments.

     For the year ended October 31, 2005, the  adjustments  were to decrease net
investment  income by $(64,964)  and decrease  accumulated  net realized loss on
investments by $284,449 and decrease capital by $219,485  primarily  relating to
the reclassification of realized foreign currency losses. Net investment income,
net realized losses and net assets were not affected by this change.

         During the current year, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards
of $5,357,320.

     During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004 the Fund
had no distributable earnings.

     At October 31, 2005,  the Fund had a remaining  capital  loss  carryover of
$36,494,637,  of which $11,531,273 expires in the year 2006,  $6,225,150 expires
in the year 2009, $13,474,882 expires in the year 2010 and $5,263,332 expires in
the year 2011 available to offset future net capital gains.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
The Japan Equity Fund, Inc.

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  statement  of assets and  liabilities,
including the portfolio of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at October 31,  2005,  the results of its  operations  for the year then
ended,  the  changes  in its net  assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the
United States of America.  These financial  statements and financial  highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's  management;  our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on  these
financial  statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these
financial  statements  in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at October
31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Board   Consideration  and  Approval  of  Investment   Advisory  and  Management
Agreements (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

     At a meeting of the Board of Directors of The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc. held
on June 2, 2005,  the Board reviewed and considered the nature and extent of the
investment  advisory  services  provided  by  Daiwa  SB  Investments  Ltd.  (the
"Investment  Adviser")  under the Advisory  Agreement  and Daiwa SB  Investments
(USA) Ltd.  (the  "Manager"  and,  together  with the  Investment  Adviser,  the
"Advisers") under the Investment  Management  Agreement.  The Board reviewed and
considered   the   qualifications   of  the   portfolio   manager,   the  senior
administrative  managers and other key  personnel of the Manager who provide the
investment  advisory  services  to the  Fund.  The  Board  determined  that  the
portfolio  manager and key  personnel of the Manager are  qualified by education
and/or  training and  experience  to perform the  services in an  efficient  and
professional  manner.  The Board also reviewed the services provided to the Fund
by the  Investment  Adviser  and the  personnel  of the  Investment  Adviser who
provide those  services.  The Board  concluded that the nature and extent of the
advisory services provided were necessary and appropriate for the conduct of the
business and  investment  activities of the Fund.  The Board also concluded that
the overall quality of the advisory services was satisfactory.

Performance Relative to the Fund's Benchmark

     The Board  reviewed  the Fund's  performance  for the last one-,  three-and
five-year  periods,  as well as for the last 20  quarters,  as  provided  in the
materials distributed to the Board prior to the Meeting,  compared to the Fund's
benchmark,  the Tokyo  Stock  Price  Index.  The  Board  noted  that the  Fund's
performance  was lower  than the  benchmark  for the one-,  three-and  five-year
periods.   The  Board   discussed   with  the   Adviser   the  reasons  for  the
underperformance  in these  periods.  The Board also noted that, for the last 20
quarters,  the Fund's performance varied as compared to the benchmark,  however,
the Fund, in most quarters,  performed in line with, or only slightly below, the
benchmark.  The Board further noted that the Fund outperformed the benchmark for
the most recent period. The Board concluded that the Fund's overall  performance
was satisfactory.

Fees Relative to Other Funds Advised by the Advisers

     The Board  reviewed  the  advisory  fee paid by the Fund under the Advisory
Agreement  and the  Investment  Management  Agreement  (together,  the "advisory
fee").  The Board also  reviewed  information  showing the advisory fees paid by
other funds managed by each of the Advisers as compared to the advisory fee paid
by the  Fund.  The  Board  noted  that the  Manager  does not  manage  any other
closed-end  funds that would  provide an  appropriate  comparison  to the Fund's
advisory fee. The Board further noted that,  while the  Investment  Adviser does
not manage any other U.S. registered funds, it does advise other Japanese equity
funds with  advisory fees that are equal to or higher than the advisory fee paid
by the Fund.  The Board  concluded  that the  advisory  fee paid by the Fund was
appropriate as compared to other funds advised by the Advisers.

Fees and Expenses Relative to Comparable Funds Managed by Other Advisers

     The Board  considered the advisory fees paid by the other funds in the Fund
Complex,  The Singapore Fund, Inc. and The Thai Capital Fund,  Inc., as compared
to the  advisory  fee paid to the  Fund's  Advisers.  The Board  noted  that the
advisory fee paid by the Fund is lower than the advisory fees paid to

Board   Consideration  and  Approval  of  Investment   Advisory  and  Management
Agreements (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Singapore Fund, Inc. and The Thai Capital Fund, Inc. In addition,  the Board
reviewed the fee paid to the other U.S. registered  closed-end fund investing in
Japan.  The Board noted that the advisory fee rate for the other fund was higher
than for the Fund,  although noting that the other fund generally  invested in a
different  part of the  Japanese  market.  In addition,  the Board  examined the
advisory  fees paid to other  closed-end  funds  investing in a single  country.
While the fees vary widely,  the majority of these fees paid in connection  with
these  country funds were in the 1.00% and higher  range,  especially  for those
funds that invested in countries in Asia.  The Board  concluded  that the Fund's
advisory fee was competitive  with these other country funds.  The Board further
noted that the total  expense ratio of the Fund was lower than that of the other
funds in the Fund Complex,  and many other country funds, and concluded that the
Fund's total expense ratio was competitive.

Breakpoints and Economies of Scale

     The Board reviewed the structure of the Fund's  advisory fee schedule under
the Advisory  Agreement and  Investment  Management  Agreement and noted that it
does include breakpoints.  The Board considered that the Fund is closed-end. The
Board  concluded  that  economies  of scale for this Fund were not a factor that
needed to be considered at the current asset levels.

Profitability of the Advisers

     The Board  considered and reviewed a  profitability  report for each of the
Advisers for the last year included in the materials  previously provided to the
Board.  Based on their  review  of the  information  they  received,  the  Board
concluded that the profits earned by each Adviser were not excessive in light of
the advisory services provided to the Fund.

Advisers Financially Sound and Financially Capable of Meeting the Fund's Needs

     The Board considered  whether each of the Advisers is financially sound and
has the  resources  necessary  to perform  its  obligations  under the  Advisory
Agreement  and  Investment  Management  Agreement.  The  Board  noted  that each
Adviser's  operations  remain  profitable.  The Board concluded that each of the
Advisers has the financial  resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under
the Advisory Agreement and Investment Management Agreement.

Historical Relationship Between the Fund and the Advisers

     The Board also reviewed and considered the historical  relationship between
the Fund and the Advisers, including the organizational structure of each of the
Advisers,  the policies  and  procedures  formulated  and adopted by each of the
Advisers  for  managing  the Fund's  assets and the  Board's  confidence  in the
competence and integrity of the senior managers and key personnel of each of the
Advisers. The Board concluded that it is beneficial for the Fund to continue its
relationship with the Advisers.

the Fund's business.

Agreement for another year.

           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS


I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for The Thai Capital Fund, Inc., The Japan
     Equity  Fund,  Inc.  and  The  Singapore  Fund,  Inc.  (each a  "Fund"  and
     collectively  the "Funds")  applies to each Fund's  President and Treasurer
     (or persons  performing  similar  functions)  ("Covered  Officers") for the
     purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that a Fund files with,  or submits to, the  Securities
          and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public  communications
          made by a Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    prompt internal  reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high standard of business  ethics
and should be  sensitive to  situations  that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent  conflicts  of  interest.  A Fund will expect all  Covered  Officers to
comply at all times with the  principles  in this Code. A violation of this Code
by an employee is grounds for disciplinary  action up to and including discharge
and possible legal  prosecution.  Any question about the application of the Code
should be referred to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors ( the
"Audit Committee").

II.  Covered Officers Should Handle  Ethically Actual and Apparent  Conflicts of
     Interest

     Overview.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his  service  to, a Fund.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
a Fund.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and a Fund and  already  are  subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment  Company Act")
and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 (the  "Investment  Advisers Act").  For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other  property)  with a Fund
because  of their  status as  "affiliated  persons"  of a Fund.  The  compliance
programs  and  procedures  of a Fund  and  the  Fund's  Investment  Manager  and
Investment Adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,  violations
of these  provisions.  Certain  conflicts  of  interest  also  arise  out of the
personal   securities  trading  activities  of  the  Covered  Officers  and  the
possibility that they may use information  regarding a Fund's securities trading
activities  for their  personal  benefit.  Each Fund's Code of Ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act is designed to address these conflicts of
interest. This Code does not, and is not intended to, replace these programs and
procedures  or a Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics,  and this  Code's  provisions
should  be  viewed  as  being  additional  and  supplemental  to such  programs,
procedures and code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between a Fund and its  Investment  Adviser or  Investment  Manager of which the
Covered  Officers  are also  officers  or  employees.  As a  result,  this  Code
recognizes that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether  formally  for a Fund  or for  its  Investment  Adviser  or  Investment
Manager,  or  for  all  parties),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and
implementing  decisions  that  will have  different  effects  on the  Investment
Adviser or  Investment  Manager  and a Fund.  The  participation  of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
a Fund and its Investment  Adviser or Investment  Manager and is consistent with
the  performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as officers of a Fund.
Thus, if performed in conformity  with the provisions of the Investment  Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically.  In addition, it is recognized by a Fund's Board of Directors
(the "Board") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one
or more other investment companies covered by other codes.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o    use his personal  influence or personal  relationships  improperly  to
          influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by a  Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
          of a Fund;

     o    cause  a Fund  to  take  action,  or  fail  to  take  action,  for the
          individual  personal  benefit of the Covered  Officer  rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

     o    use material  non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions made or
          contemplated  for, or actions proposed to be taken by, a Fund to trade
          personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation of the
          market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered  Officer  must,  at the time of signing this Code,  report all
material  business  affiliations  outside  a Fund and  must  update  the  report
annually.

     Covered  Officers should avoid  situations which involve the appearance of,
or potential for, conflicts of interest. Examples of these situations include:

     o    accepting directly or indirectly,  anything of value,  including gifts
          and  gratuities  in excess of $100 per year from any  person or entity
          with which a Fund has current or prospective  business  dealings,  not
          including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting events or
          other  similar   entertainment,   provided  it  is   business-related,
          reasonable  in  cost,  appropriate  as to time  and  place  and not so
          frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

     o    any   ownership   interest  in,  or  any   consulting   or  employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service  providers,  other than its
          Investment  Adviser or  Investment  Manager or any  affiliated  person
          thereof; and

     o    a direct or indirect  financial  interest in commissions,  transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio transactions
          or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from
          the  Covered  Officer's  employment,  such as  compensation  or equity
          ownership.

     In situations  involving a Covered Officer which involve the appearance of,
or the  potential  for,  conflicts  of interest,  but where the Covered  Officer
believes that no significant  conflict of interest  exist,  the Covered  Officer
must obtain prior written  approval  from the Audit  Committee  before  becoming
involved in that  situation.  No such  approval  shall be considered a waiver of
this Code.

III. Disclosure and Compliance

     o    Each Covered  Officer should  familiarize  himself with the disclosure
          and compliance requirements generally applicable to a Fund;

     o    Each  Covered  Officer  should not  knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
          others to misrepresent,  facts about a Fund to others,  whether within
          or outside a Fund, including to a Fund's directors and auditors, or to
          governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of a Fund
          and its  Investment  Adviser or  Investment  Manager  with the goal of
          promoting full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable  disclosure
          in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC
          and in other public communications made by a Fund; and

     o    It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code or (thereafter as applicable,  upon becoming
          a  Covered  Officer),  affirm  in  writing  to the  Board  that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     o    annually  thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     o    not retaliate  against any other Covered  Officer or any employee of a
          Fund or their affiliated  persons for reports of potential  violations
          that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify the Audit  Committee  promptly if he knows of any  violation of
          this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any waivers sought by a Covered
Officer must be considered by the Audit Committee.

     A copy of this Code shall be delivered to each  employee of a Fund and each
employee of its Investment Adviser and Investment Manager annually together with
a  memorandum  requesting  that  any  violations  of the  Code  be  communicated
immediately to the Audit Committee.

     Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating  and enforcing this
Code:

     o    the Audit  Committee will take all  appropriate  action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to it;

     o    if, after such  investigation,  the Audit  Committee  believes that no
          violation  has occurred,  the Audit  Committee is not required to take
          any further action;

     o    if the Audit Committee  determines  that a violation has occurred,  it
          will consider  appropriate  action,  which may include  review of, and
          appropriate  modifications  to,  applicable  policies and  procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the Investment Adviser or its
          board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o    the Audit Committee will be responsible  for granting  waivers of this
          Code, as appropriate; and

     o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   Changes To or Waivers of the Code

     No  change to or waiver  of any  provision  of this Code will be  effective
until a Fund  discloses  the  nature of any  amendment  to, or  waiver  from,  a
provision of the Code in its Form N-CSR,  or on its website within five business
days  following the date of the amendment or waiver if this method of disclosure
has been  established  in its Form N-CSR and made  available  on its website for
twelve months. Any waiver of provisions of this Code will be reported in filings
with the SEC and otherwise reported to a Fund's  stockholders to the full extent
required by the rules of the SEC and by any  applicable  rules of any securities

counsel and its Investment  Adviser and Investment  Manager and their respective
counsel.

IX.  Internal Use

     The Code is  intended  solely for the  internal  use by a Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of a Fund, as to any fact, circumstance
or legal conclusion.

     I have  read  and  understand  the  terms  of the  Code.  I  recognize  the
responsibilities  and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.

                           The Japan Equity Fund, Inc.
                       Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures


     The Board of Directors of The Japan Equity Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund")  hereby
adopts  the  following  policy and  procedures  with  respect to voting  proxies
relating to Fund  securities  managed by Daiwa SB  Investments  (USA) Ltd.  (the
"Investment Manager").

I.   Policy

     It is the policy of the Board of  Directors  of the Fund (the  "Board")  to
delegate the  responsibility  for voting proxies  relating to securities held by
the Fund to the Investment  Manager as part of the Manager's general  management
of the Fund's assets, subject to the Board's continuing oversight.  The Board of
Directors of the Fund hereby  delegates  such  responsibility  to the Investment
Manager,  and directs the  Investment  Manager to vote proxies  relating to Fund
portfolio  securities  managed by the  Investment  Manager  consistent  with the
duties and procedures set forth below. The Investment  Manager may retain one or
more vendors to review,  monitor and  recommend  how to vote proxies in a manner
consistent  with the duties  and  procedures  set forth  below,  to ensure  such
proxies  are voted on a timely  basis and to  provide  reporting  and/or  record
retention services in connection with proxy voting for the Fund.

II.  Fiduciary Duty

     The right to vote a proxy with respect to securities held by the Fund is an
asset of the Fund. The Investment  Manager, to which authority to vote on behalf
of the Fund is delegated,  acts as a fiduciary of the Fund and must vote proxies
in a manner  consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.
In  discharging  this fiduciary  duty, the Investment  Manager must maintain and
adhere to its policies and procedures  for addressing  conflicts of interest and
must vote in a manner substantially consistent with its policies, procedures and
guidelines, as presented to the Board.

III. Procedures

     The   following   are  the   procedures   adopted  by  the  Board  for  the
administration of this policy.

     A.   Review of Investment Manager's Proxy Voting Procedures. The Investment
          Manager  shall  present to the Board their  policies,  procedures  and
          other guidelines for voting proxies at least annually, and must notify
          the Board  promptly  of  material  changes to any of these  documents,
          including changes to policies addressing conflicts of interest.

     B.   Voting  Record  Reporting.  The  Investment  Manager shall provide the
          voting record  information  necessary for the completion and filing of
          Form-NPX to the Fund at least annually. Such voting record information
          shall be in a form  acceptable  to the Fund and shall be  provided  at
          such time(s) as are required for the timely  filing of Form-NPX and at
          such  additional  time(s) as the Fund and the  Investment  Manager may
          agree  from  time to time.  With  respect  to those  proxies  that the
          Investment   Manager  has   identified  as  involving  a  conflict  of
          interest1,  the  Investment  Manager  shall  submit a separate  report
          indicating  the  nature  of the  conflict  of  interest  and how  that
          conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy.

     C.   Record Retention.  The Investment  Manager shall maintain such records
          with  respect  to the  voting of  proxies  as may be  required  by the
          Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules promulgated  thereunder
          or by the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940 and the rules  promulgated
          thereunder.

     D.   Conflicts of Interest.  Any actual or potential  conflicts of interest
          between the  Investment  Manager and the Fund's  shareholders  arising
          from the proxy voting  process  will be  addressed  by the  Investment
          Manager and the Investment  Manager's  application of its proxy voting
          procedures pursuant to the delegation of proxy voting responsibilities
          to the Investment  Manager.  In the event that the Investment  Manager
          notifies the officer(s) of the Fund that a conflict of interest cannot
          be resolved under the Investment  Manager's  Proxy Voting  Procedures,
          such  officer(s)  are  responsible  for  notifying the Chairman of the
          Board of the  Fund of the  irreconcilable  conflict  of  interest  and
          assisting the Chairman with any actions he determines are necessary.

IV.  Revocation

     The  delegation by the Board of the  authority to vote proxies  relating to
securities of the Fund is entirely voluntary and may be revoked by the Board, in
whole or in part, at any time.

V.   Annual Filing

     The Fund shall file an annual  report of each proxy  voted with  respect to
securities of the Fund during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX
not later than August 31 of each year.2

          by the  Fund  and the  Investment  Manager  to  determine  how to vote

          and procedures; and

     2.   a  statement  disclosing  that  a  description  of  the  policies  and
          procedures  used by or on behalf of the Fund to determine  how to vote

          charge,  upon  request,  by  calling  the Fund's  toll-free  telephone
          number;  through a specified Internet address,  if applicable;  and on

          calling the Fund's toll-free  telephone number; or through a specified
          Internet address; or both; and on the SEC's website.

                        Proxy voting policy for Daiwa SB
                             Investments (USA) Ltd.


                    Statement of Policies and Procedures for
                                 Voting Proxies


Introduction

     As a  registered  investment  adviser,  Daiwa  SB  Investments  (USA)  Ltd.
("Daiwa," "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests
of our clients.  As part of this duty, we recognize that we must exercise voting
rights in the best interests of our clients.

     Daiwa  recognizes the  importance of good corporate  governance in ensuring
that   management  and  boards  of  directors   fulfill  their   obligations  to
shareholders.  As part of our  investment  process,  we take  into  account  the
attitudes of management and boards of directors on corporate  governance  issues
when deciding whether to invest in a company.

     Daiwa is a global investment manager, and invests significantly in emerging
markets.   It  should  be  noted  that  protection  for  shareholders  may  vary
significantly  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction,  and in some  cases  may be
substantially less than in the U.S. or developed countries.

     This  statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the  Investment
Advisers  Act of 1940.  It sets  forth the policy  and  procedures  of Daiwa for
voting proxies for our clients,  including investment companies registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES

     It is the general policy of Daiwa to support management of the companies in
which it invests and will cast votes in accordance with management's  proposals.
However,  Daiwa  reserves the right to depart from this policy in order to avoid
voting decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best interests.

     Elections  of  Directors:  In many  instances,  election of  directors is a
routine voting issue. Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or we
determine  that there are other  compelling  reasons for  withholding  votes for
directors,  we will vote in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.
That  said,  we believe  that  directors  have a duty to respond to  shareholder
actions that have  received  significant  shareholder  support.  We may withhold
votes for directors  that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement
proposals  to   declassify   boards,   failure  to  implement  a  majority  vote
requirement,  failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder  vote and failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of  shareholders  have  tendered  their
shares.

     Appointment  of Auditors:  The  selection of an  independent  accountant to
audit a company's  financial  statements is generally a routine business matter.
Daiwa  believes  that  management  remains  in the best  position  to choose the
accounting firm and will generally support management's recommendation.

     Changes in Capital Structure:  Changes in a company's charter,  articles of
incorporation  or by-laws  are often  technical  and  administrative  in nature.
Absent a  compelling  reason  to the  contrary,  Daiwa  will  cast its  votes in
accordance  with the company's  management on such proposals.  However,  we will
review and analyze on a case-by-case  basis any  non-routine  proposals that are
likely to affect the  structure  and operation of the company or have a material
economic effect on the company.

     Corporate  Restructurings,  Mergers and Acquisitions:  Daiwa believes proxy
votes dealing with corporate  reorganizations are an extension of the investment
decision and will take account of our investment  process policy in deciding how
to vote.

     Corporate  Governance:  Daiwa  recognizes  the importance of good corporate
governance in ensuring that management and the board of directors  fulfill their
obligations  to  the  shareholders.   We  generally  favor  proposals  promoting
transparency and accountability within a company.

     Social and Corporate  Responsibility:  Daiwa  recognizes  the importance of
supporting sound and responsible  policies in relation to social,  political and
environmental issues. However, in the interests of shareholders,  we reserve the
right to vote  against  proposals  that  are  unduly  burdensome  or  result  in
unnecessary  and excessive  costs to the company.  We may abstain from voting on
social  proposals that do not have a readily  determinable  financial  impact on
shareholder value.

     Executive  Compensation:  Daiwa  believes that company  management  and the
compensation committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be given
latitude to  determine  the types and mix of  compensation  and  benefit  awards
offered.  Whether  proposed  by a  shareholder  or  management,  we will  review
proposals relating to executive compensation plans and, if deemed excessive, may
vote against the proposals.

PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES

Proxy voting

     Our  portfolio  management  team is  responsible  for the  coordination  of
Daiwa's proxy  voting.  They liaise with the Product  managers  and/or the Proxy
voting  committee to ascertain how Daiwa will vote.  They will then instruct the
relevant  Custodians.  The portfolio  management  team is also  responsible  for
ensuring that full and adequate records of proxy voting are kept.

     The  Product   managers  will  implement  the  Proxy  voting   policies  by
instructing  proxy voting in accordance  with the general  principles  contained
herein.

Proxy Voting Committee

     We have formed a Proxy Voting  Committee  to  regularly  review our general
proxy  policies and consider  specific  proxy voting  matters as and when deemed
necessary.  Members of the committees  include senior  investment  personnel and
representatives  of the Legal & Compliance  Department.  The  committee may also
evaluate  proxies  where we face a material  conflict of interest (as  discussed
below).

Conflicts of Interest

     Daiwarecognizes that there is a potential conflict of interest when we vote
a proxy  solicited  by an issuer  with  whom we have any  material  business  or
personal  relationship  that may affect how we vote on the  issuer's  proxy.  We
believe that  oversight by the proxy voting  committee  ensures that proxies are
voted  with only our  clients'  best  interests  in mind.  In order to avoid any
perceived conflict of interests,  the following procedures have been established
for use when we encounter a potential conflict.

     The portfolio  management  team will refer to the Legal and compliance team
any proxy  votes that are issued by  existing  clients  or where  Daiwa  holds a
significant voting percentage of the company. The Legal and compliance team will
make the initial  determination  about  whether a material  conflict of interest
exists based on the facts and circumstances of each particular situation.

     If our proposed vote is consistent with our stated proxy voting policy,  no
further review is necessary.

     If our proposed  vote is contrary to our stated proxy voting  policy but is
also contrary to management's recommendation, no further review is necessary.

     If our proposed  vote is contrary to our stated proxy voting  policy and is
consistent with  management's  recommendation,  the proposal is escalated to the
proxy committee for final review and determination.

Proxies of Certain Non-U.S. Issuers

     Proxy  voting in certain  countries  requires  "share  blocking."  That is,
shareholders  wishing to vote their  proxies must deposit  their shares  shortly
before the date of the meeting (usually one-week) with a designated  depositary.
During this blocking period,  shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be
sold  until the  meeting  has taken  place and the shares  are  returned  to the
clients'  custodian banks.  Daiwa may determine that the value of exercising the
vote does not outweigh the detriment of not being able to transact in the shares
during this period.  Accordingly,  if share  blocking is required we may abstain
from voting those shares.  In such a situation we would have determined that the
cost of voting exceeds the expected benefit to the client.

proxies by contacting  our Client  services team at Daiwa SB  Investments  (USA)

1    As it is used in this document, the term "conflict of interest" refers to a
     situation  in which the  Investment  Manager or  affiliated  persons of the
     Investment  Manager  have a financial  interest in a matter  presented by a
     proxy other than the  obligation  they incur as  Investment  Manager to the
     Fund  which  could   potentially   compromise  the   Investment   Manager's
     independence  of  judgment  and  action  with  respect to the voting of the
     proxy.

2    The Fund must file its first  report on Form N-PX not later than August 31,
     2005, for the  twelve-month  period beginning July 1, 2003, and ending June
     30, 2005.
