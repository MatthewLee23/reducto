Chairman's
Letter to Shareholders

[PHOTO OF ROBERT P. BERMNER]

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

The problems in the U.S. financial system and the slowdown in global economic
activity continue to create a very difficult environment for the U.S. economy.
The administration, the Federal Reserve System and Congress have initiated a
variety of programs directed at restoring liquidity to the financial markets,
providing financial support for critical financial institutions and stimulating
economic activity. There are encouraging signs that these initiatives are
beginning to have a constructive impact. It is not possible to predict whether
the actions taken to date will be sufficient to restore more normal conditions
in the financial markets or enable the economy to stabilize and set a course
toward recovery. However, the speed and scope of the government's actions are
very encouraging and more importantly, reflect a commitment to act decisively to
meet the economic challenges we face.

The performance information in the attached report reflects the impact of many
forces at work in the equity and fixed income markets. The comments by the
portfolio manager describe the strategies being used to pursue your Fund's
long-term investment goals. Parts of the financial markets continue to
experience serious dislocations and thorough research and strong investment
disciplines have never been more important in identifying risks and
opportunities. I hope you will read this information carefully.

Your Board is particularly sensitive to our shareholders' concerns in these
uncertain times. We believe that frequent and thorough communication is
essential in this regard and encourage you to visit the Nuveen website:
www.nuveen.com for recent developments in all Nuveen funds. We also encourage
you to communicate with your financial consultant for answers to your questions
and to seek advice on your long-term investment strategy in the current market
environment.

Nuveen continues to work on resolving the issues related to the auction rate
preferred shares situation, but the unsettled conditions in the credit markets
have slowed progress. Nuveen is actively pursuing a number of solutions, all
with the goal of providing liquidity for preferred shareholders while preserving
the potential benefits of leverage for common shareholders. We appreciate the
patience you have shown as we work through the many issues involved.

On behalf of myself and the other members of your Fund's Board, we look forward
to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

Portfolio Manager's Comments

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG, NEA

Portfolio manager Paul Brennan reviews key investment strategies and the
six-month performance of these six insured Funds. With 20 years of industry
experience, including 12 years at Nuveen, Paul assumed portfolio management
responsibility for all these funds in 2006.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THE FUNDS DURING THE SIX-MONTH ENDED
APRIL 30, 2009?

During this time, the municipal market remained under pressure from price
volatility, reduced liquidity and fundamental economic concerns. After a very
difficult start to the period, market conditions began to show signs of
improvement in mid-December 2008, and municipal bonds were on an improving trend
during the first four months of 2009. In this environment, we continued to focus
on finding bonds that offered relative value while seeking to manage liquidity
and invest for the long term.

Much of our investment activity during this period was driven by opportunities
created by market conditions. We sought to capitalize on this environment by
continuing to take a bottom-up approach to finding undervalued sectors and
individual credits with the potential to perform well over the long term. This
was true in both the new issuance and secondary markets. In the primary market,
we found bonds with better structures (such as, higher coupons or longer call
protection) than we have seen in a long time, as market conditions required
issuers to enhance offerings to make them more attractive to buyers. In the
secondary markets, we were able to purchase bonds at discounted prices as the
result of selling by some municipal market participants, particularly in
November and December 2008. Although some bonds were offered at extremely
discounted prices during this period, our emphasis was always on carefully
selecting securities we believed offered exceptional value. In general, the
bonds we purchased were ones where we were already familiar with the credit
being offered or where we were adding to positions or sectors currently held in
the portfolio.

All the Funds now have the ability to own uninsured bonds. However, the majority
of the Funds' holdings continued to focus on insured securities, especially
those issued by essential service providers, including water and sewer,
utilities and state and local general obligation bonds. In most cases, we
purchased credits with longer maturities to take advantage of the spreads
offered by the extremely steep yield curve. However, our investment activity was
somewhat limited by the smaller supply of appropriate insured paper currently
available in the market, as the number of suitable insurers as well as the

amount of insured new issuance continued to decline. Insured issues comprised
18% of new supply in 2008, compared with 47% in 2007.

Some of the needed liquidity for new purchases was generated by proceeds from
bond redemptions. In addition, we monitored the types of credits and bond
structures that were attractive to the retail market and took advantage of
strong bids to sell bonds into relatively consistent retail demand. The bonds we
sold tended to have shorter maturities, as these generally offered more
liquidity and were in greater demand by retail buyers. Selling shorter duration1
bonds and reinvesting further out on the yield curve also helped to improve the
Funds' total return potential and overall call protection profiles.

We continued to use inverse floating rate securities2 in all six Funds. We
employed inverse floaters for a variety of reasons, including duration
management, income enhancement, and as a form of leverage. NVG also invested in
additional types of derivatives3 intended to help manage its duration and common
share net asset value (NAV) volatility without having a negative impact on its
income stream or common share dividends over the short term. As of April 30,
2009, the inverse floaters remained in place in all six Funds, while we had
removed the derivative positions from NVG.

For the six months ended April 30, 2009, the cumulative returns on common share
NAV for all six Funds outperformed the returns on both the Barclays Capital
Insured Municipal Bond Index and the Standard & Poor's Insured Municipal Bond
Index, while the funds underperformed the returns for the Lipper Insured
Municipal Debt Funds Average.

Key management factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this six-month
period included duration and yield curve positioning, the use of derivatives,
credit and sector allocations and individual security selection. In addition,
the use of leverage was an important factor affecting the Funds' performances
over this period. The impact of leverage is discussed in more detail on page 7.

*     Six-month returns are cumulative; returns for one-year,five-year,and
      ten-year are annualized.

      Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance
      may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns do not reflect the
      deduction of taxes that shareholders may have to pay on Fund distributions
      or upon the sale of Fund shares.

      For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for
      your Fund in this report.

(1)   Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
      change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
      changes than bonds with shorter durations.

(2)   An inverse floating rate security, also known as inverse floaters, is a
      financial instrument designed to pay long-term tax-exempt interest at a
      rate that varies inversely with a short-term tax-exempt interest rate
      index. For the Nuveen Funds, the index typically used is the Securities
      Industry and Financial Markets (SIFM) Municipal Swap Index (previously
      referred to as the Bond Market Association Index or BMA). Inverse
      floaters, including those inverse floating rate securities in which the
      Funds invested during the reporting period, are further defined within the
      Notes to Financial Statements and Glossary of Terms Used in this Report
      sections of this report.

(3)   Each Fund may invest in derivative instruments such as forwards, futures,
      options, and swap transactions. For additional information on the
      derivative instruments in which each Fund was invested during and at the
      end of the reporting period, see the Portfolio of Investments, Financial
      Statements, and Notes to Financial Statements sections of this report.

(4)   The Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds Average is calculated using the
      returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period as
      follows: six-months, 23 funds; 1-year, 23 funds; 5-year, 21 funds; and
      10-year, 16 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of
      dividends.

(5)   The Barclays Capital (formerly Lehman Brothers) Insured Municipal Bond
      Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged national index comprising a broad range
      of insured municipal bonds. Results for the Barclays Capital index do not
      reflect any expenses.

(6)   The Standard & Poor's (S&P) Insured Municipal Bond Index is an
      unleveraged, market value-weighted index designed to measure the
      performance of the Insured U.S. municipal bond market.

Over this period, the municipal bond yield curve remained steep with longer-term
yields significantly higher than shorter-term yields. Bonds in the Barclays
Capital Municipal Bond Index maturing in ten years or more, especially bonds
with maturities of approximately 15 years and 22 years or longer, benefited the
most from this interest rate environment. While NEA and NQI had relatively
better overall duration and yield curve positioning for these market conditions,
all six Funds had significant exposure to the longer part of the yield curve,
which benefited their performances.

As mentioned earlier, all of these Funds continued to use inverse floating rate
securities. During this period, these instruments generally had a positive
impact on the Funds' overall performances while also helping to support their
income streams. In addition, NVG, which had a duration that was shorter than our
strategic target, used derivative positions during part of this period to
synthetically extend its duration closer to our target. These derivative
positions, which boosted the Fund's interest rate sensitivity, performed well
and made a positive contribution to NVG's total return performance.

Credit quality exposure was also an important positive performance factor.
Risk-averse investors put a priority on higher quality investments, causing
bonds with higher credit to perform very well, and the performances of these
insured Funds generally benefited from their higher quality holdings.

The "essential service" sectors provided the biggest boost to the Funds' returns
during this period and mostly included the general obligation/tax-supported,
utility and health care sectors. On the whole, the Funds had good weightings in
these top-performing sectors.

The Funds' significant allocation to the pre-refunded7 sector generally
detracted from the Funds' performances. Backed by U.S. Treasuries, these bonds
which had been the top-performing segment of the municipal market last year,
provide higher credit quality and an element of safety and resilience, making
them attractive holdings during periods of market distress. However, the shorter
effective maturities of these bonds hampered their performance during this
period. As of April 30, 2009, NIF had the smallest allocation of pre-refunded
bonds among these six Funds, which benefited this Fund by limiting the impact of
these underperforming holdings.

Individual security selection was also a factor in the insured Funds'
performances during this period. The Funds' returns, as well as their
allocations to various credit quality sectors, were impacted to varying degrees
by downgrades of municipal bond insurers, and the subsequent impact on the
ratings and values of insured bonds. See page 7 for more information on
municipal bond insurers. Overall, NIF had stronger results from its security
selection for this period, while NPX was more negatively impacted by weaker
security selection than the other Funds in this report.

(7)   Pre-refundings, also known as advance refundings or refinancings, occur
      when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
      interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
      lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

In addition to the factors previously discussed, one of the primary reasons for
the strong six-month returns recorded by Funds was the Funds' use of financial
leverage. This positive contribution to performance stands in sharp contrast to
the preceding six-month period, when leverage had a generally detrimental impact
on the Funds' returns. This can be seen by comparing the six-month and one-year
Fund returns shown on page 5.

Financial leverage offers opportunities to generate additional income and total
return for common shareholders under a variety of market conditions. However,
leverage may work to the common shareholders' disadvantage during periods when
bond prices are extraordinarily volatile or in sharp decline. During the six
months covered by this report, overall conditions within the municipal bond
market were relatively favorable, in contrast to the relatively unfavorable
market conditions during the fall of 2008.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING BOND INSURANCE COMPANIES

Another factor that had an impact on the performance of these Funds was their
positions in bonds backed by municipal bond insurers that experienced downgrades
in their credit ratings. During the period covered by this report, all bond
insurers experienced one or more rating reductions by at least one or more
rating agencies. At the time this report was prepared, there are no longer any
bond insurers rated AAA by all three of the major rating agencies (Moody's
Investor Service, S&P and Fitch) and at least one rating agency has placed each
insurer on "negative credit watch," "credit watch evolving," "credit outlook
developing," or "rating withdrawn," which may presage one or more rating
reductions for any insurer in the future. As concern increased about the balance
sheets of insurers, prices on insured bonds - especially those bonds issued by
weaker underlying credits - declined, detracting from the Funds' performances.
By the end of this period, most insured bonds were being valued according to
their fundamentals as if they were uninsured. On the whole, the holdings of all
of these Funds continued to be well diversified and it is important to note that
municipal bonds historically have had a very low rate of default.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SECURITIES MARKETS

As noted in the last shareholder report, beginning in February 2008, more shares
were submitted for sale in the regularly scheduled auctions for the auction rate
preferred shares issued by these Funds than there were offers to buy. This meant
that these auctions "failed to clear," and that many, or all, of the Funds'
auction rate preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in these
auctions were unable to do so. This decline in liquidity in auction rate
preferred shares did not lower the credit quality of these shares, and auction
rate preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions
at the "maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions, as calculated in accordance
with the pre-established terms of the auction rate preferred shares.

These developments generally have not affected the portfolio management or
investment policies of these Funds. However, one continuing implication for
common shareholders of these auction failures is that the Funds' cost of
leverage will likely be higher, at least temporarily, than it otherwise would
have been had the auctions continued to be successful. As a result, the Funds'
future common share earnings may be lower than they otherwise might have been.

As noted in the last shareholder report, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees
authorized a plan to use tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as floating rate
securities, to refinance a portion of the Funds' outstanding auction rate
preferred shares. As of April 30, 2009, the amount of auction rate preferred
securities redeemed by the Funds are as shown in the accompanying table.

Subsequent to the reporting period, NIF, NVG and NEA noticed for redemption an
additional $9,175,000, $8,150,000 and $4,150,000 action rate preferred
securities, respectively.

As noted in the last shareholder report, all of NPX's redemptions were achieved
through the issuance of variable rate demand preferred shares (VRDP) in
conjunction with the proceeds from the creation of TOBs. VRDP is a new
instrument designed to replace the auction rate preferred shares used as
leverage in Nuveen closed-end funds. VRDP is offered only to qualified
institutional buyers, defined pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of
1933. As of April 30, 2009, NPX has $219 million of VRDP.

While the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees and management continue to work to
resolve this situation, the Funds cannot provide any assurance on when the
remaining outstanding auction rate preferred shares might be redeemed.

Common Share Dividend
and Share Price Information

During the six-month period ended April 30, 2009, NIF had one monthly dividend
increase, while the dividends of NQI, NIO, NPX, NVG and NEA remained stable
throughout the period.

Due to normal portfolio activity, common shareholders of NIO received a net
ordinary income distribution of $0.0010 per share at the end of December 2008.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2009, all six of
the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances, based on our best estimate,
for tax purposes and positive UNII balances for financial statement purposes.

COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE AND SHARE PRICE INFORMATION

The Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved an open-market share repurchase
program on July 30, 2008, under which each Fund may repurchase an aggregate of
up to 10% of its outstanding common shares. Since the inception of this program,
NQI, NIO, NIF, and NPX have not repurchased any of their outstanding common
shares.

As of April 30, 2009, NVG and NEA repurchased common shares as shown in the
accompanying table.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  Primarily all of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
     to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that
     guarantee  the  timely  payment of  principal  and  interest.  See Notes to
     Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  Primarily all of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
     to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that
     guarantee  the  timely  payment of  principal  and  interest.  See Notes to
     Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(4)  The Fund paid  shareholders a net ordinary income  distribution in December
     2008 of $0.0010 per share.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  Primarily all of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
     to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that
     guarantee  the  timely  payment of  principal  and  interest.  See Notes to
     Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  Primarily all of the Fund's net assets  (including net assets  attributable
     to  Variable  Rate Demand  Preferred  shares)  are  invested  in  municipal
     securities that guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest. See
     Notes to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 -Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable to
     Auction Rate Preferred  shares) are invested in municipal  securities  that
     guarantee  the  timely  payment of  principal  and  interest.  See Notes to
     Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)  The  percentages  shown in the  foregoing  chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
     reporting  period.  Please see the Portfolio  Manager's  Commentary  for an
     expanded  discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of
     certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
     underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable to
     Auction Rate Preferred  shares) are invested in municipal  securities  that
     guarantee  the  timely  payment of  principal  and  interest.  See Notes to
     Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(3)  Taxable-Equivalent  Yield  represents  the  yield  that must be earned on a
     fully  taxable  investment,  in order to equal  the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax  basis.  It is based on a federal  income  tax rate of 28%.  When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

      Primarily all of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities
      that guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the reporting
      period. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 31.4%.

N/R   Not rated.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating Rate Securities for
      more information.

      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the reporting
      period. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the
      underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(6)   Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 32.5%.

N/R   Not rated.

WI/DD Purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating Rate Securities for
      more information.

      to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities
      that guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

      Total Investments is 32.6%

N/R   Not rated.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

      Primarily all of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares) are invested in municipal
      securities that guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest.
      See Note to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more
      information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
      reporting period. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an
      expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the
      ratings of certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to
      the ratings of the underlying insurers both during the period and
      after period end.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a
      percentage of Total Investments is 30.0%.

N/R   Not rated.

(ETM) Escrowed to maturity.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating Rate Securities for
      more information.

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities
      that guaran- tee the timely payment of principal and interest. See Notes
      to Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the
      reporting period. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an
      expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the
      ratings of certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to
      the ratings of the underlying insurers both during the period and
      after period end.

(4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S.
      Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of principal
      and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be equivalent to
      AAA rated securities.

(5)   Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has variable rate and
      demand features which qualify it as a short-term investment. The rate
      disclosed is that in effect at the end of the reporting period. This rate
      changes periodically based on market conditions or a specified market
      index.

(6)   Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a percentage of
      Total Investments is 32.5%.

N/R   Not rated.

(IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

(UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing
      transaction pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 140. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1- Inverse Floating Rate Securities for
      more information.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

</TABLE>

      At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
      to Auction Rate Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities
      that guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest. See Notes to
      Financial Statements, Footnote 1 - Insurance, for more information.

(1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
      assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

(2)   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of the
      earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call provisions
      at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities may
      be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

(3)   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's")
      or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
      Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be below investment
      grade.

      The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on certain bonds
      whose insurer has experienced downgrades as of the end of the reporting
      period. Please see the Portfolio Manager's Commentary for an expanded
      discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
      bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of the

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc. (NQI), Nuveen
Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2 (NPX),
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG) and Nuveen Insured
Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA) (collectively, the "Funds"). Common
shares of Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured
Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) are traded on the NYSE Amex (formerly, American Stock
Exchange). The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as closed-end, management investment companies.

During the fiscal period, the Board of Directors/Trustees of each of the
following funds voted to recommend that each Nuveen Florida closed-end fund be
merged or reorganized into one of three existing Nuveen national municipal bond
closed-end funds, as follows:

o     Nuveen Florida Investment Quality Municipal Fund (NQF) and Nuveen Florida
      Quality Income Municipal Fund (NUF) into Nuveen Premium Income Municipal
      Fund 2, Inc. (NPM);

o     Nuveen Insured Florida Premium Income Municipal Fund (NFL) into Insured
      Opportunity (NIO);

o     Nuveen Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NWF) into
      Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA)

(collectively, the "Reorganizations"). The Board called a special meeting of
shareholders of each fund, originally scheduled in each case for May 15, 2009,
to vote on the Reorganizations. Those meetings were subsequently adjourned to
and reconvened in mid-June, at which time, shareholders of each of Florida
Investment Quality (NQF), Florida Quality Income (NUF), Insured Florida Premium
Income (NFL) and Insured Florida Tax-Free Advantage (NWF) approved its
respective Reorganization, with more than 80% of participating shares of each
fund voting in favor of the Reorganization. The consummation of the respective
Reorganizations remains subject to the approval of shareholders of Premium
Income 2 (NPM), Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA),
as the case may be, whose special shareholder meetings are now scheduled to be
reconvened on July 24, 2009. There can be no assurance that approval by those
funds' shareholders will be obtained.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a portfolio of
municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with US
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation
The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Prices
of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent pricing service
approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When market price quotes
are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal securities),
the pricing service or, in the absence of a pricing service for a particular
investment or derivative instrument, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the
Fund, or its designee, may establish fair value using a wide variety of market
data including yields or prices of investments of comparable quality, type of
issue, coupon, maturity and rating, market quotes or indications of value from
security dealers, evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral, general
market conditions and other information and analysis, including the obligor's
credit characteristics considered relevant. Temporary investments in securities
that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term
investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates value.

Notes to
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited)

Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2009, Insured
Opportunity (NIO) had outstanding when issued/delayed delivery purchase
commitments of $3,799,129. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments
in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income
Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any. Dividend
income, if any, is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Income Taxes
Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, and in
the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax
applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to
shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income
distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions, management of the
Funds has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that
would require recognition in the financial statements. Open tax years are those
that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the last
four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). Furthermore,
management of the Funds is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from US
generally accepted accounting principles.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares
The following Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares,
$25,000 stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each
Fund's Auction Rate Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The
dividend rate paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days,
pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is
payable at the end of each rate period. As of April 30, 2009, the number of
Auction Rate Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund
is as follows:

================================================================================

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the Auction Rate Preferred shares issued by the Funds
than there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear,"
and that many Auction Rate Preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their
shares in these auctions were unable to do so. Auction Rate Preferred
shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the "maximum
rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with the
pre-established terms of the Auction Rate Preferred shares.

These developments have generally not affected the portfolio management or
investment policies of the Funds. However, one implication of these auction
failures for Common shareholders is that the Funds' cost of leverage will likely
be higher, at least temporarily, than it otherwise would have been had the
auctions continued to be successful. As a result, the Funds' future Common share
earnings may be lower than they otherwise would have been. As of April 30, 2009,
the aggregate amount of outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares redeemed by
each Fund is as follows:

Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares
On August 7, 2008, Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) issued 2,190 Series 1 Variable
Rate Demand Preferred shares, $100,000 liquidation value per share, in a
privately negotiated offering. Proceeds of this offering along with the proceeds
from the Fund's creation of tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as "floaters"
or floating rate obligations, were used to redeem all of the Fund's outstanding
Auction Rate Preferred shares totaling $268,900,000. The Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shares were offered to institutional buyers as defined pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, have a maturity date of August 1,
2038 and include a liquidity feature that allows the Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shareholders to have their shares purchased by the liquidity provider
in the event that sell orders are not matched with purchase orders in a
remarketing. Dividends on the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares (which are
treated as interest payments for financial reporting purposes) are set weekly at
a rate established by a remarketing agent; therefore, the liquidation value of
the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares approximates fair value.

Subject to certain conditions, Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares may be
redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund
may also redeem certain of the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares if the Fund
fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements and such failures are not
cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption price per share is equal to
the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any accumulated but unpaid
dividends.

Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) had all of its $219,000,000 Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shares outstanding for the six months ended April 30, 2009, with an
annualized interest rate of 1.02%.

Notes to
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited)

For financial reporting purposes only, the liquidation value of Variable Rate
Demand Preferred shares is recorded as a liability on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities and the dividends paid on the Variable Rate Demand Preferred
shares are included as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of
offering costs" on the Statement of Operations. In addition to interest expense,
the Fund also paid a per annum liquidity fee which is recognized as "Liqudity
fees" on the Statement of Operations.

Insurance
Except to the extent that each of Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity
(NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invests
in temporary investments, all of the net assets of each Fund will be invested in
municipal securities that are covered by insurance guaranteeing the timely
payment of principal and interest or backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities to
ensure timely payment of principal and interest. Insurers must have a claims
paying ability rated "Aaa" by Moody's or "AAA" by Standard & Poor's for Insured
Premium Income 2 (NPX) and "A" or better by at least one independent rating
agency for Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Premier Insured
Income (NIF). Municipal securities backed by an escrow account or trust account
will not constitute more than 20% of each Fund's net assets.

Under normal circumstances, Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured
Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) will invest at least 80% of their net assets (including
net assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance
guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest. For purposes of this
80% test, insurers must have a claims paying ability rated at least "A" at the
time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency. In addition, each of
Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) will
invest at least 80% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares) in
municipal securities that are rated at least "AA" at the time of purchase (based
on the higher of the rating of the insurer, if any, or the underlying security)
by at least one independent rating agency, or are unrated but judged to be of
similar credit quality by Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"), or municipal bonds
backed by an escrow or trust account containing sufficient U.S. Government or
U.S. Government agency securities or U.S. Treasury-issued State and Local
Government Series securities to ensure timely payment of principal and interest.
Each of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA)
may also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets attributable
to Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares) in
municipal securities rated below "AA" but at least "BBB" (based on the higher
rating of the insurer, if any, or the underlying bond) or are unrated but judged
to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Inverse Floating Rate Securities
Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as "(IF) - Inverse floating rate investment." An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS No.
140) "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities." In such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited
into a special purpose trust is identified in the Portfolio of Investments as
"(UB) - Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust," with the Fund
accounting for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as
"Floating rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In
addition, the Fund reflects in "Investment Income" the entire earnings of the
underlying bond and the related interest paid to the holders of the short-term
floating rate certificates is included as a component of "Interest expense and
amortization of offering costs" on the Statement of Operations.

During the six months ended April 30, 2009, each Fund invested in
externally-deposited inverse floaters and/or sell deposited inverse floaters.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is recognized as
"Unrealized depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

At April 30, 2009, each Fund's maximum exposure to externally-deposited Recourse
Trusts, is as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Unaudited)

Forward Swap Transactions
Each Fund is authorized to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. Insured Dividend
Advantage (NVG) invested in forward interest rate swap transactions during the
six months ended April 30, 2009.

Market and Credit Risk
In the normal course of business each Fund may invest in financial instruments
and enter into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to
changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to the
transaction to perform (credit risk). Similar to credit risk, each Fund may be
exposed to counterparty risk, or the risk that an institution or other entity
with which the Fund has unsettled or open transactions will default. The
potential loss could exceed the value of the financial assets recorded on the
financial statements. Financial assets, which potentially expose each Fund to
credit risk, consist principally of cash due from counterparties on forward,
option and swap transactions. The extent of each Fund's exposure to credit and
counterparty risks in respect to these financial assets approximates their
carrying value as recorded on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Each Fund helps manage credit risk by entering into agreements only the Adviser
believes have the financial resources to honor their obligations and by having
the Adviser monitor the financial stability of the counterparties. Additionally,
counterparties may be required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily
valuation of the financial asset) on behalf of each Fund with a value
approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined
threshold. Reciprocally, when each Fund has an unrealized loss, the Funds have
instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a
value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss above a
pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently
adjusted if and when the valuations fluctuate, either up or down, by at least
the predetermined threshold amount.

Zero Coupon Securities
Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the Portfolios of Investments
with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description. The market prices of zero coupon
securities generally are more volatile than the market prices of securities that
pay interest periodically.

Offering Costs
Costs incurred by Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) in connection with its offering
of the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares ($2,535,000) were recorded as a
deferred charge which will be amortized over the 30-year life of the shares and
are included as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations.

Custodian Fee Credit
Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications
Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
During the current fiscal period, the Funds adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS No. 157) "Fair Value
Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosure about fair value measurements. In determining the value of each
Fund's investments various inputs are used. These inputs are summarized in the
three broad levels listed below:

   Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

   Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
             similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
             etc.).

   Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including management's assumptions
             in determining the fair value of investments).

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of each Fund's fair value measurements as of April
30, 2009:

5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To the extent that differences arise that
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual
report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the
net asset values of the Funds.

At April 30, 2009, the cost of investments was as follows:

6. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate
Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares) of each Fund as
follows:

                                                           INSURED QUALITY (NQI)

For the next $125 million                                                 .4375
For the next $250 million                                                 .4250
For the next $500 million                                                 .4125

For the next $3 billion                                                   .3875
For net assets over $5 billion                                            .3750

================================================================================

The annual complex-level fee, payable monthly, which is additive to the
fund-level fee, for all Nuveen sponsored funds in the U.S., is based on the
aggregate amount of total fund assets managed as stated in the following table.
As of April 30, 2009, the complex-level fee rate was .1998%.

================================================================================

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate daily managed net assets of all Nuveen
      funds, with such daily managed net assets defined separately for each fund
      in its management agreement, but excluding assets attributable to
      investments in other Nuveen funds. For the complex-level and fund-level
      fee components, daily managed net assets includes assets managed by the
      Adviser that are attributable to each fund's use of financial leverage.
      For these purposes, financial leverage includes the funds' use of
      preferred stock and borrowings and investments in the residual interest
      certificates (also called inverse floating rate securities) in tender
      option bond (TOB) trusts, including the portion of assets held by the TOB
      trust that has been effectively financed by the trust's issuance of
      floating rate securities, subject to an agreement by the Adviser to limit
      the amount of such assets for determining managed net assets in certain
      circumstances.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or
Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares), for fees and expenses in the amounts and

7. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 161 (SFAS No. 161)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard is intended to enhance
financial statement disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and enable investors to understand: a) how and why a fund uses
derivative instruments, b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
are accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
affect a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As of April 30, 2009,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional footnote disclosures may be
required about the use of derivative instruments and hedging items.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 157-4 (FSP No. 157-4)

On April 9, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP No. 157-4,
"Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or
Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not
Orderly." FSP No. 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value
in accordance with SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," when the volume and
level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. FSP
No. 157-4 also requires additional disaggregation of the current SFAS No. 157
required disclosures. FSP No. 157-4 is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be applied
prospectively. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FSP
No. 157-4 and the impact it will have on the financial statement disclosures.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   Rounds to less than $.01 per share.

****  During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
      Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser of $27,762
      and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
      investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment restrictions.
      This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Funds' Total Return on
      Common Share Net Asset Value.

***** Annualized.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund, where applicable, as
      both are more fully described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

(b)   For the six months ended April 30, 2009.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   Annualized.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund, where applicable, as
      both are more fully described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

(b)   For the six months ended April 30, 2009.

</TABLE>

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   Annualized.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
      attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
      shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
      floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund, where applicable, as
      both are more fully described in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand
      Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities, respectively.

Reinvest Automatically Easily and Conveniently

Nuveen makes reinvesting easy. A phone call is all it takes to set up your
reinvestment account.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may exceed
the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the acquisition of fewer
shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued

by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage commissions on open
market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These commissions usually
will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of Terms Used in this Report

o     AUCTION RATE BOND: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities are created by
      depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a
      special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a)
      issues floating rate certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt
      interest rates to third parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the
      deposited bond's par amount or market value, and (b) issues an inverse
      floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater")
      to an investor (such as a Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure
      to a long-term municipal bond. The income received by the holder of the
      inverse floater varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the
      floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the holder
      of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the underlying bond's
      downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater typically also
      benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
      underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents
      an investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

<PAGE>

o     LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's NAV per common share is calculated by
      subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares
      issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then
      dividing the remainder by the number of common shares outstanding. Fund
      NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

o     TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.
