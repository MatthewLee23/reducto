President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

During the first three quarters of 2011, the U.S. economy struggled to gain
solid footing. The economy went through a soft patch in the first half, and the
second half, so far, has been highlighted by the U.S. government's battle over
the debt ceiling and Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. Treasury's credit
rating from the top rating of "AAA" for the first time in history. After
rallying nicely in the first half, U.S. equity markets reacted sharply this
summer to the political stalemate and the downgrade. There has been continued
pressure on equities due to concerns about the growing European sovereign-debt
crisis and its potential impact on the global economy.

Despite legitimate reasons for concern, we believe there are also reasons for
optimism that the U.S. economy will continue to exhibit modest growth and is
not headed into a severe recession. Corporations continue to post solid
earnings and, for the most part, are maintaining their positive earnings
outlooks. They also have strong balance sheets with improved net leverage and
high cash levels. Auto production has rebounded following the Japanese
supply-chain interruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami last spring.
Retail sales growth year-over-year has remained steady despite low consumer
confidence. And despite high unemployment in the U.S., private sector
employment has grown consistently, albeit modestly, since February 2010. There
are certainly risks to our outlook, including possible contagion from the
European sovereign-debt and banking crisis, the fiscal drag from federal and
state budget cuts in the U.S., as well as potential "negative feedback loops"
from capital-market volatility. But broadly speaking, we think the subpar
economic recovery is consistent with recoveries from other "balance
sheet"-caused recessions.

The difficult recovery process has been accompanied by wide market swings.
While this is a challenging environment, our investment professionals continue
to focus on finding good investment opportunities in both equity and bond
markets, using the same disciplined approach Pioneer has used since 1928. Our
approach is to identify undervalued individual securities with the greatest
potential for success, carefully weighing risk against reward. Our teams of
investment professionals continually monitor and analyze the relative
valuations of different sectors and securities globally to help build
portfolios that we believe can help you achieve your investment goals.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/11

Against a backdrop of rapid and frequent changes in investor sentiment,
floating-rate bank loans produced generally modest, but positive performance
during the 12 months ended November 30, 2011. In the following interview,
Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2011. Mr.
Sharkey, vice president and portfolio manager at Pioneer, is responsible for
the daily management of the Trust.

Q How did the Trust perform during the 12 months ended November 30, 2011?

A Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 6.99% at net asset value and 2.60% at
  market price during the 12 months ended November 30, 2011, with shares of the
  Trust selling at a 0.80% premium to net asset value at the end of the period.
  During the same 12-month period, the Trust's benchmark, Barclays Capital U.S.
  High Yield Loans Index, returned 2.06%, while the Trust's former benchmark,
  the Credit Suisse Leverage Loan Index, returned 2.65%. Unlike the Trust, the
  benchmarks do not use leverage. While the use of leverage can increase
  investment opportunity, it also can increase investment risk. During the same
  12-month period, the average return (at market price) of the 28 closed end
  funds in Lipper's Closed-End Loan Participation Funds (Leveraged) category was
  2.50%.

  On November 30, 2011, the Trust's standard 30-day SEC yield was 10.17%.

Q What were the principal factors that affected the Trust's performance during
  the 12 months ended November 30, 2011?

A During the 12-month period, the Trust's increased emphasis on loans to
  companies likely to benefit from improving economic conditions helped
  performance relative to the benchmark, especially during those times when
  investors were more optimistic about both the economy and prospects for
  growing corporate earnings. To be sure, the 12-month period featured many
  phases during which investor sentiment about the overall health of the economy
  and the potential for a sustained recovery fluctuated between optimism and
  pessimism. However, as investor attitudes changed, we retained our belief that
  while growth trends might slacken, the economy would continue to grow and the
  risks of a double-dip recession were minimal. Over the 12-month period, we
  increased the Trust's exposure to loans to companies in the economically
  sensitive basic materials and capital goods industries, while reducing
  investments in the more defensive health care, utilities and telecom groups.
  The Trust's results were supported by the positioning

  decisions, combined with good performance from a number of Trust investments
  in loans to companies based in cyclically sensitive areas that were trading at
  discounts. The Trust's performance during the period also was helped when a
  number of older loans in the portfolio were refinanced. We often were able to
  use the proceeds from the retired loans to take on new Trust investments in
  higher-yielding loans.

Q What was the investment environment like for investments in floating-rate
  loans during the 12 months ended November 30, 2011?

A During the first half of the annual reporting period, floating-rate bank loans
  performed very well, as did other credit-sensitive investments, amid general
  investor confidence about the growth of the economy and the financial health
  of corporations. Also helping the markets were the effects of the Federal
  Reserve System's (the Fed's) purchases of securities in the open market, which
  led to a greater investor appetite for risk in late 2010, and for most of the
  first half of 2011. It had become widely anticipated by investors that the Fed
  might raise interest rates by the end of 2011. The anticipation helped lead to
  record inflows to loan funds in December 2010, and again in January and
  February 2011. The activity fueled spread tightening, refinancing of recent
  new issues and the emergence of "covenant-lite" loans, which are loans with
  relatively looser safeguards for investors.

  The supportive investment environment changed abruptly, however, late in the
  summer of 2011. Credit-exposed securities fell into disfavor in August 2011
  amid investor concerns about sovereign-debt problems in Europe and worry about
  reports that indicated growth in the U.S. was slowing. High-yield bond
  portfolios, which had been influential buyers of bank loan investments,
  started reducing their investments in loans as they experienced outflows of
  money (redemptions). Bank loans generally declined in value during that time
  frame, but lower-rated loans were most affected by the slump, as August was
  the second-worst month on record for loans. In addition, bank loans were
  adversely affected when the Fed signaled its intention to keep short-term
  interest rates low, at least until mid-2013. The news discouraged those who
  had invested in floating-rate loans in expectation that interest rates soon
  would start rising and the yields on the loans would increase. As some
  investors sold their bank loan positions, the average prices of bank loans
  declined, although not nearly as much as they did during the credit decline in
  2008 when there was a forced unwinding of portfolios that had used leverage
  and the average bid prices of loans fell to as low as $61 in the Barclays
  Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index. Bid prices on loans dropped to only $90
  in August 2011, which provided evidence that much of the leverage had already
  left the system.


                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  5
<PAGE>

  Investor sentiment changed again and bank loans started recovering in value in
  September and October 2011 as investors again recognized the value in the
  asset class, especially in light of generally healthy corporate earnings
  reports and a very low default rate for bank loans. However, the apparent
  rally in bank loans stalled again in November 2011 -- the final month of the
  Trust's annual reporting period -- primarily on concerns about the potential
  effects of European debt problems on the global economy. Nevertheless, we
  believed bank loan prices were very appealing at the end of the period. As of
  November 30, 2011, the actual default rate for bank loans was less than 1.5%
  (well below the historical 3.6% average), but the prices of bank loans were
  carrying an implied default rate of 16%, based on historical trends. We
  believe that data continue to make bank loans a very attractive investment.
  Despite all the volatility during 2011 in the credit markets, at the end of
  November loans still were on track to have a positive return for the full 2011
  calendar year. The loan market, in fact, has produced total returns in 13 of
  the past 14 years, with 2008 being the only exception.

Q What types of investments most influenced the Trust's performance during the
  12 months ended November 30, 2011?

A The Trust's investments in lower-priced loans, relative to the general bank-
  loan universe, tended to help results during the 12-month period. Individual
  Trust positions that supported results included an investment in a bank loan
  to SMG H5, an Australian broadcasting company also known as Seven Media. The
  company made prepayments on some of its debt after it issued new equity and
  eventually the debt was paid out at the end of the period with a complete
  refinancing. Another notable contributor to Trust performance was a bank loan
  to Fenwal, a health care supply company that improved its operating results at
  the same time that it prevailed in a patent-protection dispute. A Trust
  investment in a loan to Spirit Finance, a real estate investment trust
  investing in strip mall properties, also performed well after the company
  announced plans for an initial stock offering. Other investments that helped
  the Trust's results included loans to Alpha Topco (also known as Formula One
  Racing), an operator of an automobile racing circuit that negotiated a
  long-term contract with sponsors; and NCO Group, a financials company that
  buys credit-card receivables and which benefited from an announced potential
  refinancing.

  Some Trust investments disappointed, however, during the period. One of the
  more notable detractors from performance was a loan to Broadstripe, a small
  cable communications service provider that has been going through a
  bankruptcy. Other positions that held back the Trust's results included loans
  to Celtic Pharma, a special-purpose drug developer that traded off due to the
  timing of drug trials; and Sun Healthcare Group, a long-term health care
  provider that was hurt by changes in government reimbursement formulas.

<PAGE>

Q Could you describe how leverage is used in managing the Floating Rate Trust?

A Leverage is used in an effort to increase the yield of the Trust. Leverage was
  provided through the issuance of auction-rate preferred shares. The proceeds
  from the issuance of auction-rate preferred shares were used to increase the
  amount of assets available to be invested in additional portfolio securities.
  To the extent that dividend rates payable on auction-rate preferred shares are
  generally lower than the returns produced by investing in additional portfolio
  securities, the Trust's yield will be greater than what it would have been had
  the Trust's portfolio not been leveraged.

Q How did the level of leverage employed by the Trust change over the 12 months
  ended November 30, 2011?

A At the end of the 12-month period, 37.3% of the Trust's total managed assets
  were financed by leverage, compared with 37.3% of the Trust's total managed
  assets financed by leverage at the start of the fiscal year on December 1,
  2010.

Q Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities over the 12 months ended
  November 30, 2011, and if so, did the investments have a material effect on
  the Trust's performance?

A The Trust did invest in a foreign-exchange derivative Australian Dollar to
  U.S. Dollar Swap to mitigate foreign-exchange risk associated with the Trust's
  investment in the loan to SMG H5, the Australian broadcasting firm mentioned
  earlier. The exposure to this derivative did not, however, have a material
  effect on performance. The Trust had no investments in derivative securities
  after we liquidated this swap position when the investment in SMG H5 was
  refinanced late in the fiscal year.

Q What is your investment outlook?

A We believe we have been seeing increased evidence that the economic recovery
  is gaining more solid footing, with recent data suggesting improvements in
  both the housing market and the employment picture -- two areas that had been
  slow to show progress. We expect the recovery to continue, although the pace
  of economic growth is likely to be moderate. At a time when loan default rates
  remain low and corporations generally have shown good profit growth, we think
  the environment for bank loans should be solid, especially given their low
  recent prices. Loan spreads have been more than compensating for the
  anticipated default rate, and we expect that bank loan investments should
  continue to produce their promised income. In addition, the supply of bank
  loans and the demand for them appear to be in balance.


                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  7
<PAGE>

  We think that the overall outlook for bank loans is positive and that
  investors are receiving solid, risk-adjusted coupons while waiting for
  interest rates to go up as the result of either increased inflation or a
  change in Fed policy.

  Note to Shareowners: Effective March 1, 2011, the Trust's benchmark was
  changed from the Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index to the Barclays
  Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index.

  The Trust's adviser believes that the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans
  Index (the Barclays Index) is a more appropriate floating-rate bank loan index
  for the Trust, for two main reasons: 1) because the Barclays Index is updated
  more frequently than the CS Leveraged Loan Index, the Trust's management team
  is able to perform better analytical reviews of the Trust's portfolio
  holdings; and 2) the Barclays Index tracks a universe of loan securities that
  are more in line with the types of securities that fall under the Trust's
  investment mandate. Conversely, the CS Leveraged Loan Index tracks some
  securities that do not fall within the Trust's investment universe.

  For comparison purposes, Pioneer will report performance for the Trust's
  former benchmark, the CS Leveraged Loan Index, in this November 30, 2011,
  annual report. This will be the last Trust report featuring returns for the
  former benchmark.

of Trust securities.

<PAGE>

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the
Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally
more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks,
including the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return
for the holders of common shares. Since February of 2008, regularly scheduled
auctions for the Trust's preferred shares have failed and preferred shareowners
have not been able to sell their shares at auction. The Board of Trustees of
the Trust has considered, and continues to consider, this issue.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such
as redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the
net earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. These statements should
not be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends
are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a representative index of tradeable, senior,
secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The index began in January 1992.
Comparisons for this index begin in 2004. The Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield
Loans Index measures the performance of high-yield loans. Since comparisons for
the Barclays Index begin in 2006; the chart assumes an initial investment of
$10,913, which is equal to the Trust's value at 11/30/2006. Index returns are
calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns,
do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The indices do not employ
leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Schedule of Investments | 11/30/11 (continued)

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

  Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
  Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
             similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
             etc.)
  Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
             assumptions in determining fair value of investments)

Generally, equity securities are categorized as Level 1, fixed income
securities and senior loans are categorized as Level 2 and securities valued
using fair value methods (other than prices supplied by independent pricing
services) as Level 3. See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/11

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a
diversified fund. The investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high
level of current income. The Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek
preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its primary objective of
high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:


A. Security Valuation

   Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
   loan interests (senior loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
   established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
   bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
   Loan Pricing Corporation, an independent pricing service. Senior loans for
   which no reliable price quotes are available will be valued by Loan Pricing
   Corporation through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.
   Fixed-income securities with remaining maturity of more than sixty days are
   valued at prices supplied by independent pricing services, which consider
   such factors as market prices, market events, quotations from one or more
   brokers, Treasury spreads, yields, maturities and ratings. Valuations may be
   supplemented by dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities
   that have traded on an exchange are valued at the last sale price on the
   principal exchange where they are traded. Equity securities that have not
   traded on the date of valuation or securities for which sale prices are not
   available, generally are valued using the mean between the last bid and asked
   prices. Short-term fixed income securities with remaining maturities of sixty
   days or less generally are valued at amortized cost. Money market mutual
   funds are valued at net asset value.


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  45
<PAGE>

   Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
   times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in
   computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined as of such
   times.

   Securities or senior loan interests for which independent pricing services
   are unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are
   not readily available or are considered to be unreliable are valued using
   fair value methods pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.
   The Trust may use fair value methods if it is determined that a significant
   event has occurred after the close of the exchange or market on which the
   security trades and prior to the determination of the Trust's net asset
   value. Examples of a significant event might include political or economic
   news, corporate restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or
   trading halts. Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ from
   exchange prices.

   At November 30, 2011, twenty-five securities that were valued using fair
   value methods (in addition to securities valued using prices supplied by
   independent pricing services) representing 3.4% of net asset applicable to
   common shareowners. Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a
   security may include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company,
   current market conditions and comparable securities.

   Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
   respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to maturity
   basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis of the
   security. Premiums and discounts related to certain mortgage-backed
   securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the monthly paydowns.
   Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is
   recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at
   the applicable country rates.

   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
   dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
   are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
   the exercise of reasonable diligence.

   Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
   cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.


B. Foreign Currency Translation

   The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
   denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
   current exchange rates.

   Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
   represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
   currency


46   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11
<PAGE>

   contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between the
   amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received. Further, the
   effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments are not
   segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of changes in
   market prices of those securities but are included with the net realized and
   unrealized gain or loss on investments.


C. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

   The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
   the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
   future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
   exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in
   the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records realized gains and losses
   at the time a portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction
   or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering
   into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
   the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of
   foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 5).


D. Federal Income Taxes

   It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
   Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
   all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
   shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Tax
   years for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by
   federal and state tax authorities.

   The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
   financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal income
   tax rules. Therefore, the sources of the Trust's distributions may be shown
   in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess of net
   investment income or as from net realized gain (loss) on investment and
   foreign currency transactions, or as from paid-in capital, depending on the
   type of book/tax differences that may exist.

   Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of
   2010, the Trust will be permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in
   taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period.
   However, any losses incurred during those future years will be required to be
   utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre-enactment tax years. As a result
   of this ordering rule, pre-enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more
   likely to expire unused. Additionally, post enactment capital losses that are
   carried forward will retain their character as either short-term or long-term
   capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous
   law.


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  47
<PAGE>

   At November 30, 2011, the Trust reclassified $1,872,499 to decrease
   undistributed net investment income and $1,872,499 to decrease net realized
   loss on investments to reflect permanent book/tax differences. The
   reclassification has no impact on the net assets of the Trust and presents
   the Trust's capital accounts on a tax basis.

   At November 30, 2011, the Trust had a net capital loss carryforward of
   $120,602,379, of which the following amounts will expire between 2016 and
   2019 if not utilized: $27,976,876 in 2016, $62,461,978 in 2017, $11,415,660
   in 2018 and $18,747,865 in 2019.

   The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November 30,
   2011 and November 30, 2010 was as follows:

      Total                                                      $ (157,468,973)
================================================================================
</TABLE>

   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
   primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
   methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities, and the
   realization of unrealized gain on investments in passive foreign investment
   companies.


E. Risks

   Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
   original offering prospectus with additional information included in the
   Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to those
   documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the Trust's
   investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
   interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
   economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
   those industries and sectors.


48   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11
<PAGE>

   The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The
   Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
   including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities
   and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below
   investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly
   referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to
   the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities
   involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and
   are less liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change,
   than higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of
   issuers that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. Additionally, the
   Trust may invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes are referred to as
   "insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. The return of principal and the
   payment of interest on event-linked bonds are contingent on the
   non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an
   earthquake of a specific magnitude. In addition to the specified trigger
   events, event-linked bonds may expose the Trust to other risks, including but
   not limited to issuer (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional
   interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

   The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
   developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in
   a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
   conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
   currency exchange restrictions.

   The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
   in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
   securities may be difficult to dispose of at a price reflective of their
   value at the times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their
   market price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities.
   Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the
   Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
   take advantage of market opportunities.


F. Repurchase Agreements

   With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value of
   the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
   required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
   for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
   account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the Trust. The Trust's
   investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), is responsible
   for determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to
   the repurchase price.


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  49
<PAGE>

G. Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

   All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
   automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
   Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
   distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
   of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
   Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
   capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
   voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
   notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners
   in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to any dividend
   record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with
   respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

   If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
   other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
   the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
   the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
   or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in common shares of the
   Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

   Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
   participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
   acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
   but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
   outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
   the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
   trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
   in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
   credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
   the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the shares
   are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then current market
   price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the
   payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest
   the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There
   are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However,
   each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
   with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the
   Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes
   which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding
   Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to
   another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit),
manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall
not include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility of the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the year ended November 30, 2011, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.10% of the Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the common
shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At
November 30, 2011, $363,702 was payable to PIM related to management costs,
administrative costs and certain other reimbursements and is included in "Due
to affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Effective September 1, 2010, PIM has retained State Street Bank and Trust
Company (State Street) to provide certain administrative and accounting
services to the Trust on its behalf. For such services, PIM pays State Street a
monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the Trust's average daily managed
assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in excess
of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000. Previously, PIM
had retained Princeton Administrators, LLC (Princeton) to provide such
services. PIM paid Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average
daily managed assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly
fee of $10,000. Neither State Street nor Princeton receives compensation
directly from the Trust for providing such services.


3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  51
<PAGE>

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.


4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances may be used to reduce a
portion of the Trust's custodian expenses. For the year ended November 30,
2011, the Trust expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.


5. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

</TABLE>


The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of beneficial interest
into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As of
November 30, 2011, there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series
W7,-2,432 and Series TH7-2,432.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7, and Series TH7, are cumulative at a rate
which is to be reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An
auction fails if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers.
When an auction fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum
rate on the auction dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred
shareowners are not able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails.
Since February 2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The
maximum rate for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate
or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from
1.409% to 1.505% during the year ended November 30, 2011.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Statement of
Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among
other

things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end management
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

9. Pending Litigation

The Trust is currently involved in litigation matters relating to Trust
investments. The Trust believes these claims are without merit and is defending
both vigorously. At November 30, 2011, it is reasonably possible that adverse
outcomes may result. Currently, the amount of either judgment cannot be
reasonably estimated.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2011, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2011, by correspondence
with the custodian, selling or agent banks and brokers or by other appropriate
auditing procedures where replies from selling or agent banks or brokers were
not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust at November 30, 2011, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and financial highlights for each of the
periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) serves as the investment adviser to
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between PIM and the Trust. In order for PIM to remain the investment
adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine annually whether
to renew the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in March 2011 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the
process. In July 2011, the Trustees approved the format of the contract review
materials and submitted their formal request to PIM to furnish information
necessary to evaluate the terms of the investment advisory agreement. The
contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in July 2011 and
September 2011. After reviewing and discussing the materials, the Trustees
submitted a request for additional information to PIM, and materials were
provided in response to this request. Meetings of the Independent Trustees of
the Trust were held in July, September, October, and November, 2011 to review
and discuss the contract review materials. In addition, the Trustees took into
account the information related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at each
regularly scheduled meeting.

At a meeting held on November 29, 2011, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the Independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for another year. In considering
the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees considered
various factors that they determined were relevant, including the factors
described below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the
controlling factor in determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services
The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by PIM to the Trust, taking into account the investment objective
and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees reviewed the terms of the investment
advisory agreement. The Trustees also reviewed PIM's investment approach for
the Trust, its research process and its process for trade execution. The
Trustees considered the resources of PIM and the personnel of PIM who provide
investment management services to the Trust. The Trustees considered the
non-investment resources and personnel of PIM involved in PIM's services to the
Trust, including PIM's compliance and legal resources and personnel. The
Trustees also considered the substantial attention and high priority given by
PIM's senior management to the Pioneer fund complex. In addition, the


58   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11
<PAGE>

Trustees considered PIM's plans to increase resources in its investment
management function and other enhancements to PIM's advisory capabilities.

The Trustees considered that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including
Trust officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by PIM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory
agreement.

Performance of the Trust
The Trustees considered the performance results of the Trust over various time
periods. They reviewed information comparing the Trust's performance with the
performance of its peer group of funds as classified by Morningstar, Inc.
(Morningstar), an independent provider of investment company data, and with the
performance of the Trust's benchmark index. The Trustees considered that the
Trust's annualized total return was in the first quintile of its Morningstar
category for the one period ended June 30, 2011, the fourth quintile of its
Morningstar category for the three year period ended June 30, 2011, and the
third quintile of its Morningstar category for the five year period ended June
30, 2011. (In all quintile rankings referred to throughout this disclosure,
first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's shareowners. Thus, highest
relative performance would be first quintile and lowest relative expenses would
also be first quintile.) The Trustees considered that the Trust's twelve month
average gross portfolio yield (using month end 30 day effective yields)
exceeded the twelve month average yield of the Trust's benchmark index. The
Trustees reviewed data provided by PIM showing how leverage had benefited the
Trust's common shareowners. The Trustees noted that PIM assumed sole
responsibility for the Trust's assets effective January 1, 2009. The Trustees
indicated that they were satisfied with the information presented with respect
to the performance of the Trust.

Management Fee and Expenses
The Trustees considered information on the fees and expenses of the Trust in
comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the Independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party. The
Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee rate (based on managed
assets) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 was in the second quintile
relative to the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight


                      Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/11  59
<PAGE>

peer group for the comparable period. The Trustees also considered that the
Trust's expense ratio (based on managed assets) for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2011 was in the first quintile relative to its Strategic Insight peer
group for the comparable period.

The Trustees reviewed gross and net management fees charged by PIM to its
institutional and other clients, including publicly offered European funds,
U.S. registered investment companies (in a sub-advisory capacity), and
unaffiliated foreign and domestic separate accounts. The Trustees also
considered PIM's costs in providing services to the Trust and to its other
clients and considered the differences in management fees and profit margins
for PIM's Trust and non-Trust services. In evaluating the fees associated with
PIM's client accounts, the Trustees took into account the respective demands,
resources and complexity associated with the Trust and client accounts. The
Trustees noted that in some instances the fee rates for those clients were
lower than the management fee for the Trust and considered that, under the
investment advisory agreement with the Trust, PIM performs additional services
for the Trust that it does not provide to those other clients or services that
are broader in scope, including oversight of the Trust's other service
providers and activities related to compliance and the extensive regulatory and
tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The Trustees also considered the
different entrepreneurial risks associated with PIM's management of the Trust
and the other client accounts. The Trustees concluded that the management fee
payable by the Trust to PIM was reasonable in relation to the nature and
quality of the services provided by PIM.

Profitability
The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses.
The Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in
comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that the
profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its
organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees
concluded that PIM's profitability with respect to the management of the Trust
was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale
The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is
a closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees
concluded that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement.

<PAGE>

Other Benefits
The Trustees considered the other benefits to PIM from its relationship with
the Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services
provided by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the
revenues and profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business.
The Trustees considered the intangible benefits to PIM by virtue of its
relationship with the Trust and the other Pioneer funds. The Trustees concluded
that the receipt of these benefits was reasonable in the context of the overall
relationship between PIM and the Trust.

Conclusion
After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors,
the Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on
or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the new SEC
pre-approval rules, the Fund's audit committee is required
to pre-approve services to affiliates defined by SEC rules
to the extent that the services are determined to have a
direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the
Fund.  For the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010,
there were no services provided to an affiliate that required
the Fund's audit committee pre-approval.

(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Fund and affiliates, as
previously defined, totaled approximately $17,942 in 2011
and $17,942 in 2010.


(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Trust's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has
considered whether the provision of non-audit services
that were rendered to the Affiliates (as defined) that were
not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrants audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit
committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual report on
this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

                                       16



Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
When a portfolio manager is responsible for the management of more than one
account, the potential arises for the portfolio manager to favor one account
over another. The principal types of potential conflicts of interest that may
arise are discussed below. For the reasons outlined below, Pioneer does not
believe that any material conflicts are likely to arise out of a portfolio
manager's responsibility for the management of the fund as well as one or more
other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted procedures that it believes are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal securities
laws and to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest to affect its
portfolio management decisions, there can be no assurance that all conflicts
will be identified or that all procedures will be effective in mitigating the
potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of such conflicts of interest
are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager has a financial incentive
to favor one account over another. Pioneer has structured its compensation
arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit such potential for conflicts
of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio Managers" below.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating new
  investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial public
  offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial public
  offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly shortly
  after the offering was allocated to a single account, that account may be
  expected to have better investment performance than other accounts that did
  not receive an allocation of the initial public offering. Generally,
  investments for which there is limited availability are allocated based upon
  a range of factors including available cash and consistency with the
  accounts' investment objectives and policies. This allocation methodology
  necessarily involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
  opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata


                                       0
<PAGE>

 basis. Although Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably designed to
 treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there may be instances
 where a fund may not participate, or may participate to a lesser degree than
 other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
  which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager determines
  to purchase a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that
  may influence the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or
  sold the security first may receive a more favorable price than accounts
  that made subsequent transactions. The less liquid the market for the
  security or the greater the percentage that the proposed aggregate purchases
  or sales represent of average daily trading volume, the greater the
  potential for accounts that make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a
  less favorable price. When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same
  security on the same day for more than one account, the trades typically are
  "bunched," which means that the trades for the individual accounts are
  aggregated and each account receives the same price. There are some types of
  accounts as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons
  (such as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise
  where the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
  best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as favorable
  a price as possible for such client.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
  compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater degree
  than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for example, the
  portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the performance of certain
  accounts relative to a benchmark while other accounts are disregarded for
  this purpose, the portfolio manager will have a financial incentive to seek
  to have the accounts that determine the portfolio manager's bonus achieve
  the best possible performance to the possible detriment of other accounts.
  Similarly, if Pioneer receives a performance-based advisory fee, the
  portfolio manager may favor that account, whether or not the performance of
  that account directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has a
  beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client or to
  compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the portfolio
  manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was one of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio manager would have
  an economic incentive to favor the account in which the portfolio manager
  held an interest.

o If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
  investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise. For
  example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account and
  sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern may
  disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making portfolio
  manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially conflicting
  situations. However, where a portfolio manager is responsible for accounts
  with differing investment objectives and policies, it is possible that the
  portfolio manager will conclude that it is in the best interest of one
  account to sell a portfolio security while another account continues to hold
  or increase the holding in such security.


COMPENSATION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation for portfolio managers that seeks
to align the financial interests of the portfolio managers with those of
shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer funds) the portfolio managers
manage, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. The compensation
program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes a base salary (determined
by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual bonus program, as well as
customary benefits that are offered generally to all full-time employees. Base
compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an annual basis. Pioneer
seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking into account the
experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The bonus plan is
intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation that is
tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment performance and
align the interests of


                                       1

the investment professional with those of shareholders, as well as with the
financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus under the plan is completely
discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may be in excess of base
salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the following factors:

o QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The quantitative investment performance
  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of all of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the fund and any
  other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-year period (20%
  weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting), measured for periods ending
  on December 31. The accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a
  group of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and investment
  focus (60%) and a broad-based securities market index measuring the
  performance of the same type of securities in which the accounts invest
  (40%), which, in the case of the fund, is the Barclays Capital U.S. High
  Yield Loans Index. As a result of these two benchmarks, the performance of
  the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured against the
  criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's competitive universe.

o QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE. The qualitative performance component with respect
  to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager includes objectives,
  such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork, leadership, communications
  and marketing, that are mutually established and evaluated by each portfolio
  manager and management.

o PIONEER RESULTS AND BUSINESS LINE RESULTS. Pioneer's financial performance,
  as well as the investment performance of its investment management group,
  affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a leverage factor of plus or
  minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers may participate in other programs designed to reward
and retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees may be
granted performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and
the financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

Item 9. Purchases of Equity Securities by Closed-End Management
Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrants equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781). Instruction to paragraph (a). Disclose
all purchases covered by this Item, including purchases that do not
satisfy the conditions of the safe harbor of Rule 10b-18 under the
Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18), made in the period covered by the
report. Provide disclosures covering repurchases made on a monthly basis.
For example, if the reporting period began on January 16 and ended on
July 15, the chart would show repurchases for the months from January 16
through February 15, February 16 through March 15, March 16 through
April 15, April 16 through May 15, May 16 through June 15, and June 16
through July 15.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrants board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G)
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrants board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14(A) in
its definitive proxy statement, or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive officer or
officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing
similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(b) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2 under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2).

Filed herewith.
