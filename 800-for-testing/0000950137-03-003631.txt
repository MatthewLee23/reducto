(1) Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
    beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
    period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
    of all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the
    period indicated.

(2) Distribution rate represents the monthly annualized distributions of the
    Trust at the end of the period and not the earnings of the Trust.

(3) The taxable-equivalent distribution rate is calculated assuming the maximum
    42.8% combined federal and state tax bracket effective for calendar year
    2003, which takes into consideration the deductibility of individual state
    taxes paid.

(4) See "Notes to Financial Statements" footnote #4, for more information
    concerning Preferred Share reset periods.

    A portion of the interest income may be taxable for those investors subject
    to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return,
    common share market price and net asset value will fluctuate and Trust
    shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. An
    investment in the Trust is subject to investment risks, and you could lose
    money on your investment in the Trust. As a result of recent market
    activity, current performance may vary from the figures shown. For more
    up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or speak with your
    financial advisor.

Q&A WITH YOUR PORTFOLIO MANAGER

WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAM FOR VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT
GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS ABOUT THE KEY EVENTS AND ECONOMIC FORCES THAT SHAPED
THE MARKETS AND INFLUENCED THE TRUST'S RETURN DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL
30, 2003. DENNIS PIETRZAK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HAS MANAGED THE TRUST SINCE 1995
AND HAS WORKED IN THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY SINCE 1968. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION
REFLECTS HIS VIEWS ON THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE.

Q   WHAT WAS THE MARKET
    ENVIRONMENT OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS, AND HOW DID THE TRUST PERFORM IN THAT
    ENVIRONMENT?

A   The environment over the past six months has been defined by two major
themes. The first of these was the level of interest rates. The period began
with interest rates at levels not seen in over three decades and, surprisingly
for many, ended with rates slightly lower. The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed)
helped keep rates low with a widely anticipated rate cut in November, driven by
economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk. The low level of rates led to a boom
in issuance by municipalities seeking to lock in low financing costs. As a
result, issuance reached a record level of $354 billion in 2002 and continued to
be exceptional in the first quarter of 2003.

    The other theme in the market during the period was the relative
attractiveness of municipal bonds, which produced enough demand to absorb the
record issuance. Investors, wary of volatility in the equity market and in the
geopolitical arena, flocked to perceived safe haven investments. Their risk
aversion counteracted growing expectations for economic recovery and rising
interest rates and was a key factor in keeping interest rates at historically
low levels. In their ongoing preference for low-risk assets, investors bid
Treasury prices up to such high levels that municipal bonds became as
attractively valued as they have ever been relative to Treasuries. Insurance
companies also moved heavily into municipal bonds as their mainstay corporate
bond holdings became less attractive. At the same time, issuers recognized
investor concerns over economic weakness by insuring roughly 50 percent of all
issuance. This credit enhancement made municipal bonds even more attractive to
risk-averse investors.

    While lower financing costs were a boon to municipal issuers, the continuing
weakness in the economy had a negative impact on municipal credit quality,
particularly in the first quarter of 2003. Moody's upgrades barely exceeded the
number of downgrades in the first quarter, with

                                        4

credit quality facing continued pressure from rising social service costs and
weak national and regional economic conditions. As a result, municipalities face
enormous deficits in 2003, when their combined shortfall is expected to reach
$90 billion.

    Performance along the yield curve was varied. The Fed's November rate cut
fueled a rally in short-term bonds that helped pull yields lower at the front
end of the curve. Despite that rally, the best performing segment of the curve
was the long-intermediate portion, where performance was largely driven by
buying activity among institutional investors drawn to the bonds' attractive
total return potential.

    The New York economy struggled along with the rest of the country, with both
the state and New York City struggling to plug enormous budget deficits. Both
the city and state's economies suffered from a drop in Wall Street profits
stemming from the declining stock market, as well as the ongoing fallout from
the events of September 11, 2001. The state has also become mired in what
appears to be an ongoing tradition of last minute wrangling over the budget
between the legislature and Governor Pataki.

    Along with California (another state facing large deficits), New York was
among the most active issuers of new and refunded debt during the period. The
state's exemption from income tax for in-state investors in New York municipal
bonds kept demand high, and the ongoing issuance was largely well received.

    The trust's monthly dividend of $0.094 per share translated to a
distribution rate of 6.67 percent based on the trust's closing common share
market price on April 30, 2003. Based on these figures, investors would have to
earn a distribution rate of 11.66 percent on a taxable investment (for an
investor in the 42.80 percent combined federal and state income tax bracket) to
match the tax-exempt yield provided by the trust.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2003, the trust produced a total return
of 9.38 percent based on common share market price. By comparison, the Lehman
Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index posted a total return of 3.50 percent for
the same period. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Investment return, common share market price and net asset value will fluctuate
and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor.

    The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged,
broad-based statistical composite of municipal bonds. Index returns do not
include any sales charges or fees that would be paid by an investor purchasing
the securities the index represents. Such costs would lower performance. It is
not possible to invest directly in an index. For additional information, please
refer to the performance summary section.

Q   WHAT STRATEGIES DID YOU PURSUE
    IN MANAGING THE TRUST?

A   With interest rates hovering near record lows, we focused on protecting the
trust from the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates while
maintaining the trust's yield. One of our primary methods for doing this was to
purchase premium bonds with maturities of between 16 and 20 years. Our
quantitative analysis showed that this segment of the yield curve offered the
optimal combination of potential for total return as well as downside protection
in the form of a comfortable yield cushion and an intermediate maturity profile.

    The funds for these purchases came from a number of sources. We trimmed the
trust's holdings of zero coupon bonds that would be likely to underperform in
the event that interest rates began to climb. We followed a similar rationale in
selling some of the portfolio's holdings of bonds in the shorter part of the
intermediate segment of the yield curve. We also sold several of the trust's
holdings of shorter maturity prerefunded bonds as part of this strategy.

    Our approach also continued to emphasize active trading of highly liquid
bonds to capture shifts in relative value between various sectors. For example,
our analysts identified several hospital bonds that were oversold during the
period and reached prices that more than compensated for any credit risk. We
bought some of these issues with the expectation of selling them once they
reached fair value. Similarly, we sold the some of the trust's transportation
holdings during the period when they reached our price targets in order to
reinvest the proceeds into bonds with greater total return potential.

    One of the sectors we avoided during the period was tobacco bonds. These
bonds were issued by states seeking to securitize their future income streams
resulting from settlements from class action suits against the major tobacco
companies. Recent litigation in Illinois resulted in a judge awarding billions
more in a suit alleging that the companies misled smokers about the amount of
nicotine in "light" cigarettes. In order to appeal, the law required the
companies to put up such substantial amounts of money that some began talking
about potential bankruptcy, and the tobacco bonds' credit ratings and price
performance suffered accordingly. Our decision not to invest in these securities
was a benefit to shareholders during the period.

(a) As required, effective November 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the
    provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies
    and began accreting market discount on fixed income securities. The effect
    of this change for the period ended October 31, 2002 was to increase net
    investment income per share by $.01 and decrease net realized and unrealized
    gains and losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment
    income to average net assets applicable to common shares by .05%. Per share,
    ratios and supplemental data for periods prior to April 30, 2002 have not
    been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(b) Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
    beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
    period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
    of all shares at the closing common share price at the end of the period
    indicated.

(c) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(d) Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e) Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
    preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
    number of preferred shares outstanding.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment. The Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
maintain, in a segregated account with its custodian, assets having an aggregate
value at least equal to the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery
purchase commitments until payment is made. At April 30, 2003, the Trust had
$1,438,544 of when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    At April 30, 2003 the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred
shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may

purposes.

approximately $4,400 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended
April 30, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $15,600
representing Van Kampen's cost of providing accounting and legal services to the
Trust, which are reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively,
in the Statement of Operations.

of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

excluding short-term investments, were $15,051,085 and $17,655,349,

1.10%. During the six months ended April 30, 2003, the rates ranged from 1.05%
to 1.70%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share

auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

     registrant and have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material

     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
     controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
     registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
