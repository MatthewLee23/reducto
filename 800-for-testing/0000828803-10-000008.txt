                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management groups--
                            Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund delivered
cumulative total returns in U.S. dollar terms of +10.40% based on market price
and +9.73% based on net asset value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM)
Global Government Bond Index (GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of
+1.59% in local currency terms and +1.07% in U.S. dollar terms for the same
period.(1) You can find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance
Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the six months under review, the global economic recovery took hold and
strengthened. For most countries, economic growth reached its low point in
2009's second quarter, and the subsequent rebound in activity benefited many
bond and currency markets. Improved economic growth in the U.S., eurozone and
Japan was accompanied by contained inflationary pressures, which allowed major
central banks to leave interest rates at very low levels and maintain ample
liquidity. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank
began preparing for eventual tightening, Japan increased its level of monetary
accommodation. Outside of the G-3 (U.S., eurozone and Japan), other central
banks such as those of Australia and Norway began to normalize their interest
rate policies given stronger growth dynamics and pricing pressures.

During the period, differentiation in recovery strength increased across regions
and countries. For example, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.1%
year-over-year in 2009's fourth quarter, while Japan's contracted 0.4% and the
eurozone's shrank 2.1%.(2) However, the positive figure recorded in the U.S. was
meager compared with growth rates outside developed economies. Real GDP in
fourth quarter 2009 rose 10.7% in China year-over-year, in India and South
Korea, 6.0%, in Brazil, 4.3%, and in Poland, 3.1%.(3)

Although increased government spending and financial sector bailouts helped
mitigate the recession's severity in developed economies like those of the U.S.
and Europe, the fiscal deterioration led to upward pressure on public debt

ratios. The International Monetary Fund estimated in its October 2009 World
Economic Outlook that the debt-to-GDP ratio of developed G-20 countries would
rise from 78% in 2007 to nearly 107% by 2010, while the corresponding debt ratio
of emerging G-20 countries would rise from 37% to nearly 40% over the same
time.(4) Increased investor and institutional scrutiny of sovereign debt
sustainability in several eurozone economies led to euro weakness and rising
interest rate spreads for those governments.

Concerns about developed economies' sovereign credit fundamentals had limited
spillover into emerging markets. Additionally, ample liquidity supported by low
interest rates maintained by many major central banks underpinned capital flows
to emerging markets given comparatively better economic growth dynamics,
interest rate prospects and credit fundamentals.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

Relative to the JPM GGBI, the Fund benefited from its interest rate strategy
during the six-month reporting period. Given historically low interest rates in
the world's largest economies, we maintained a lower duration than that of the
index. We held no U.S. Treasury securities and had limited duration exposure in
other developed bond markets. Although U.S. inflationary pressures remained
subdued by slack in the economy, characterized by a relatively high 9.7%
unemployment rate as of February 2010 and increased labor productivity, we
avoided exposure to U.S. government bonds given a large fiscal deficit (9.9% of
GDP in 2009) and what we believed were more attractive yield opportunities
elsewhere.(5) During the reporting period, the Fund's relative performance
benefited from a lack of exposure to U.S. Treasuries as long-term government
bond yields rose 21 basis points (bps) from 3.40% to 3.61%.

WHAT IS DURATION?

Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In
general, a portfolio of securities with a lower duration can be expected to be
less sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a higher duration.

     Union.

</TABLE>

*    Holding is a negative percentage because of the Fund's holdings of forward
     currency exchange contracts.

Conversely, the Fund's underweighted eurozone position and lack of exposure to
Japanese government bonds detracted from relative performance.

We maintained duration exposure in select cases where we viewed significant
slack in an economy, such as Mexico's, or prospects for a drop in risk premium,
such as in Indonesia. The Fund benefited from duration exposure in Mexico where
long-term bond yields fell 56 bps from 8.16% to 7.60%. Mexico's economic
recovery was relatively weak, with fourth quarter 2009 GDP contracting an
annualized 2.3%, supporting disinflation, or a slowdown in the rate of price
increases.(6) Additionally, Mexico passed fiscal reform legislation to increase
budget revenues and help secure fiscal stability. The Fund also benefited from
duration exposure in Indonesia, where long-term bond yields fell 66 bps from
10.51% to 9.85%.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

The Fund's currency strategy benefited relative performance. Fund positioning
during the reporting period reflected growing divergence in economic performance
among the G-3 and between developed and emerging market economies.

The Fund benefited from its large net negative position in the euro, which fell
4.90% against the U.S. dollar during the period.(7) We viewed the euro-zone's
economic growth prospects versus the U.S. as hampered by Europe's relatively
more constrained credit conditions, lower productivity, less flexible labor
market, and concerns involving the fiscal creditworthiness of Greece.
Conversely, the Fund's net negative Japanese yen position detracted from
performance given the yen's 4.39% appreciation against the U.S. dollar.(7) We
continued to view Japan as a significant economic underperformer among major
industrial countries. While the U.S. and eurozone discussed strategies for
scaling back unconventional monetary stimulus, Japan increased liquidity
injections into its commercial banking system to counter increased risks to
growth and greater deflation pressure. January 2010 consumer prices rose an
annualized 2.6% in the U.S. and 1.0% in the eurozone but fell an annualized 1.3%
in Japan.(8) We also held net negative yen exposure to protect against rising
U.S. Treasury yields given our analysis of a strong correlation between the
value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar and the differential between
interest rates in the U.S. and Japan.

The Fund also benefited from exposure to Asian currencies. Relative to the U.S.
dollar, the Indonesian rupiah rose 7.98%, the South Korean won, 7.67%, the
Australian dollar, 6.22%, and the Indian rupee, 5.90%, during the six months
under review.(7) Asia's positive economic growth momentum led policymakers to
begin tightening monetary policy. Australia was one of the first developed
economy to increase interest rates, and China and India also tightened policy
during the period. While the region's positive growth differential and rising
interest rates attracted capital inflows, its overall balance of payment
positions remained supportive as evidenced by the region's reserve accumulation.
Exposure to Latin American currencies also contributed to relative performance.
For example, the Chilean peso rose 4.88% and the Brazilian real, 3.37%, against
the U.S. dollar over the period.(7)

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT AND CREDIT STRATEGY

The Fund invested in hard currency-denominated sovereign debt. As an asset
class, these securities typically compensate for greater credit risk by offering
higher yields relative to comparable maturity U.S. and European benchmark
treasury yields. U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt generated a
six-month total return of +8.42% as measured by the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Emerging
Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG).(9) Sovereign interest rate spreads fell from
389 bps at the beginning of the reporting period to 311 bps at period-end as
emerging market credit yields declined and the U.S. Treasury yield curve
steepened.(10) Exposure to sovereign credits helped the Fund's performance
relative to the JPM GGBI.

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

PERFORMANCE DATA REPRESENT PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE
RESULTS. INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND YOU MAY HAVE
A GAIN OR LOSS WHEN YOU SELL YOUR SHARES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY DIFFER FROM
FIGURES SHOWN.

ENDNOTES

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO AND ITS
SHARE PRICE AND YIELD. BOND PRICES GENERALLY MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF
INTEREST RATES. THUS, AS PRICES OF BONDS IN THE FUND ADJUST TO A RISE IN
INTEREST RATES, THE FUND'S SHARE PRICE MAY DECLINE. SPECIAL RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED
WITH FOREIGN INVESTING, INCLUDING CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY
AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS INVOLVE HEIGHTENED
RISKS RELATED TO THE SAME FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR
RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND LESSER LIQUIDITY. THE FUND'S USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY
TECHNIQUES INVOLVES SPECIAL RISKS AS SUCH TECHNIQUES MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOSSES TO THE FUND. ALSO, AS A
NONDIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT COMPANY, THE FUND MAY INVEST IN A RELATIVELY SMALL
NUMBER OF ISSUERS AND, AS A RESULT, BE SUBJECT TO A GREATER RISK OF LOSS WITH
RESPECT TO ITS PORTFOLIO SECURITIES.

Important Notice to Shareholders

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Fund's Board previously authorized management to implement an open-market
share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase Fund shares,
from time to time, in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management.
This authorization remains in effect.

EXCHANGE-TRADED PUT AND CALL OPTIONS ON INTEREST RATE/BOND FUTURES

The Fund may purchase options on interest rate/bond futures to help hedge the
Fund's risk of potentially rising interest rates. An option on an interest rate
or bond futures contract is an exchange-traded contract in which a seller grants
to a buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a futures contract.
The buyer pays the seller a premium for the option. Contract standardization,
together with the clearing corporation guarantee, facilitates options trading. A
buyer or seller of an exchange-traded option can liquidate an open position in
an option before expiration by making an offsetting transaction. For example,
the holder of a put option can liquidate his position by selling a put with the
same strike price and expiration date. As with futures contracts, most positions
in standardized options are liquidated with an offsetting transaction before the
expiration date rather than being held for the purpose of selling or buying the
underlying instrument. The net profit or loss in an option transaction is
determined by the difference between the premium originally paid and the price
received when it is sold.

Similar to futures, options on futures trade on exchanges designated as contract
markets. They provide transparent pricing/valuation and the elimination of
counterparty risk. Unlike futures contracts, buyers of options are not required
to deposit funds in a margin account because their risk of loss is limited to
the premium paid for the option.

If the Investment Manager's judgment regarding the general direction of market
prices or interest rates is incorrect, the Fund's overall performance would be
negatively impacted. When options on futures contracts are used for hedging,
there may be an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the
underlying asset(s) on which the options on futures contract is based and
movements in the prices of the assets sought to be hedged. Adverse market
movements could cause the Fund to experience substantial losses. Futures
contracts that are traded on foreign exchanges, as well as options on such
contracts, may not be as liquid as those purchased on Commodity Futures Trading
Commission designated contract markets.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Corporate debt securities, government securities and municipal securities
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note transactions, to
assist in determining a current market value for each security. The Fund's
pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which considers
information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions, quotations
from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are considered
comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date,
option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and
yield curves, to determine current value. Debt securities denominated in a
foreign currency are converted into their U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign
exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the date that the values of
the foreign debt securities are determined. Investments in open-end mutual funds
are valued at the closing net asset value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis based upon the underlying investment book value,
anticipated future cash flows, market changes in comparable or similar
securities, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar securities,
or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions on the
disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of
such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed.
Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a security is
completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the
availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio security
held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued using
fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The Fund may enter
into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate transactions denominated
in a foreign currency. Purchases and sales of securities, income and expense
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Occasionally, events may impact
the availability or reliability of foreign exchange rates used to convert the
U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an event

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION (CONTINUED)

occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using procedures
established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A DELAYED DELIVERY BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a delayed delivery basis, with payment and
delivery scheduled for a future date. These transactions are subject to market
fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at delivery may be more
or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the Fund will generally
purchase these securities with the intention of holding the securities, it may
sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient assets have been
segregated for these securities.

D. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Fund may invest in derivative financial instruments (derivatives) in order
to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets.
Derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount,
require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than
would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market
factors, and require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may contain various
risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their
obligations under the terms of the contract, the potential for an illiquid
secondary market, and the potential for market movements which may expose the
Fund to gains or losses in excess of the amounts shown on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

Derivatives are marked to market daily based upon quotations from market makers
or the Fund's independent pricing services and the Fund's net benefit or
obligation under the contract, as measured by the fair market value of the
contract, is included in net assets. Realized gain and loss and unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on these contracts for the period are included in
the Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Fund generally enters into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge
against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain
foreign currencies. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between the Fund
and a counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange
rate on a future date. Pursuant to the terms of the forward exchange contracts,
cash or securities may be required to be deposited as collateral.

The Fund generally enters into interest rate swap contracts in order to manage
interest rate risk. An interest rate swap is an agreement between the Fund and a
counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the difference between two interest
rates, applied to a notional principal amount. Over the term of the contract,
contractually required payments to be paid and to be received are accrued daily
and recorded as unrealized depreciation and appreciation until the payments are
made, at which time they are realized. Pursuant to the terms of the interest
rate swap contract, cash or securities may be required to be deposited as
collateral.

At February 28, 2010, the fund holds $6,191,787 in U.S. Treasury securities and
$2,330,000 in cash collateral for derivatives. Unrestricted cash received may be
invested according to the Fund's investment objectives.

See Note 10 regarding other derivative information.

E. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years as of February 28, 2010, and has determined
that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

F. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and
are determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These differences may be permanent or temporary.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

F. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS
(CONTINUED)

Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their
tax character. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the
results of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may
reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases or
decreases in the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by
amounts corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments,
including adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest
income.

G. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

H. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At February 28, 2010, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized
(without par value). Transactions in the Fund's shares were as follows:

Shares issued in reinvestment of
   distributions ...............   182,179   $1,690,728   78,530   $683,052
</TABLE>

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through February 28, 2010, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the periods ended February 28,
2010 and August 31, 2009, there were no shares repurchased.

5. INCOME TAXES

For tax purposes, capital losses may be carried over to offset future capital
gains, if any. At August 31, 2009, the capital loss carryforwards were as
follows:

Capital loss carryforwards expiring in:

<TABLE>
<S>       <C>
2010 ...  $17,156,631
2011 ...    4,209,282

          -----------
          $23,202,260
          ===========
</TABLE>

For tax purposes, realized capital losses and realized currency losses occurring
subsequent to October 31, may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first
day of the following fiscal year. At August 31, 2009, the Fund deferred realized
capital losses and realized currency losses of $275,661 and $10,734,746,
respectively.

At February 28, 2010, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                                             <C>
Cost of investments..........................   $1,058,978,922

                                                ==============
</TABLE>

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, bond discounts and
premiums, swaps, tax straddles and inflation related adjustments on foreign
securities.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, bond discounts and premiums, swaps and tax straddles.

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended February 28, 2010, aggregated $137,608,479 and $144,362,667,

Fund, management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative
fees paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

8. CREDIT RISK

At February 28, 2010, the Fund had 18.86% of its portfolio invested in high
yield or other securities rated below investment grade. These securities may be
more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price volatility and are
potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default than higher rated
securities.

9. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

10. OTHER DERIVATIVE INFORMATION

At February 28, 2010, the Fund has invested in derivative contracts which are
reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as follows:

11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data
obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own market
assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining the
value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair value
hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan. If you decide
to use this service, share dividends and capital gains distributions will be
reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund for your account. BNY Mellon
Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358015, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8015, will provide
additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in new shares at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
can be made by check or money order payable to The Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Plan Administrator") and sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box
382009, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The
Plan Administrator will apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and
less a pro rata share of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open
market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan is $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P. O.
Box 358015, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8015. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares held at the
time of withdrawal to cash at current market price and send a check to the
participant for the net proceeds.

proxies  received  by the Proxy  Group will be voted  based  upon the  manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing  proxies,  the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third-party corporate governance research service
that  provides   in-depth   analyses  of  shareholder   meeting  agendas,   vote
recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services.  In addition,  the
manager  subscribes to Glass,  Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis),  an  unaffiliated
third-party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses   and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  RiskMetrics'  and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations  from  RiskMetrics,  Glass  Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's  ultimate  decision.  As a matter of policy,  the
officers,  directors/trustees  and  employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced  by outside  sources  whose  interests  conflict with the
interests  of the Fund and its  shareholders.  Efforts  are made to resolve  all
conflicts  in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  Material  conflicts of
interest  are  identified  by the Proxy  Group  based upon  analyses  of client,
distributor,  broker dealer and vendor lists,  information periodically gathered
from  directors  and  officers,  and  information  derived  from other  sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified,   the  Proxy  Group  may  defer  to  the  voting  recommendation  of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of
proxy  services;  or send the  proxy  directly  to the Fund  with the  manager's
recommendation  regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund,  the Proxy Group may refer the matter,  along with the  recommended
course of action by the manager,  if any, to an  interdepartmental  Proxy Review
Committee  (which  may  include  portfolio  managers  and/or  research  analysts
employed by the manager),  for  evaluation  and voting  instructions.  The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting  recommendation  of RiskMetrics,  Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy  directly to the Fund.  Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee  refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the  instructions  of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board or a committee of the board.

Where a material  conflict of  interest  has been  identified,  but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations  differ from Glass Lewis,  RiskMetrics,
or  another   independent   third-party   provider  of  proxy  services   relate
specifically  to (1) shareholder  proposals  regarding  social or  environmental
issues or political  contributions,  (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters  that might be  considered,  or (3) items the manager  wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote  recommendations  of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential  conflicts of interest,  the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections  12(d)(1)(E),  (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive  order;  (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested  cash in affiliated  money market funds  pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep  arrangement");  or (3) when required  pursuant to the Fund's
governing  documents or applicable  law.  Echo voting means that the  investment
manager  will vote the shares in the same  proportion  as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The  recommendation  of  management  on any issue is a factor  that the  manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted.  However, the manager does
not  consider  recommendations  from  management  to  be  determinative  of  the
manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice,  the votes with respect to
most  issues  are  cast  in  accordance  with  the  position  of  the  company's
management.  Each issue,  however,  is  considered  on its own  merits,  and the
manager  will not  support  the  position  of the  company's  management  in any
situation where it deems that the  ratification  of management's  position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S  PROXY VOTING  POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive  list of all the  issues  that  may  arise  and  the  manager  cannot
anticipate all future  situations.  In all cases,  each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers  that  key  committees  such  as  audit,  nominating,  and  compensation
committees be comprised of  independent  directors.  The manager will  generally
vote against  management  efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify  the board of directors.  The manager may withhold votes
from  directors  who have  attended  less than 75% of  meetings  without a valid
reason.  While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions,  the
manager  will review this issue as well as  proposals  to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case  basis,  taking into  consideration  factors
such  as  the  company's  corporate  governance  guidelines  or  provisions  and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF AUDITORS OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  The  manager  will  closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors.  On a case-by-case  basis,  the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also  consider,  on a  case-by-case  basis,  proposals to
rotate  auditors,  and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with the shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
believes  that  executive   compensation   should  be  directly  linked  to  the
performance of the company.  The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by  considering  several  factors  to  determine  whether  the  plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always  oppose plans that are  structured  to allow the  repricing of underwater
options,  or  plans  that  have an  automatic  share  replenishment  "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the  purchase  price is at least 85% of fair market  value,  and when  potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance  compensation  arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case  basis,
although  the  manager  will  generally  oppose  "golden  parachutes"  that  are
considered to be excessive.  The manager will normally  support  proposals  that
require a  percentage  of  directors'  compensation  to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER  MECHANISMS  AND RELATED  ISSUES.  The manager  generally  opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy  issues,  the  manager  conducts  an  independent  review of each
anti-takeover  proposal. On occasion,  the manager may vote with management when
the research  analyst has  concluded  that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require  shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder  vote and will closely  evaluate  such plans on a  case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will  generally  vote  against  any  proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate  voting  rights.  The manager  generally  opposes any  supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL  STRUCTURE.  The manager realizes that a company's  financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders,  particularly when they
involve the issuance of  additional  shares of common or preferred  stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals  by companies  to increase  authorized  shares and the purpose for the
increase.  The manager will  generally not vote in favor of  dual-class  capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior  voting rights.  The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend,  conversion  and  other  rights  of such  stock  and the  terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful  review by the  research  analyst  to  determine  whether  they would be
beneficial  to  shareholders.  The manager  will  analyze  various  economic and
strategic  factors  in making  the final  decision  on a merger or  acquisition.
Corporate  restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE  POLICY ISSUES.  The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager  may  vote in  favor of those  that  are  believed  to have  significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE.  Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager  must be flexible in these  instances  and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign  issuers.  However,  there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies,  for example,  where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders  preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may  determine  that it is not in the best  interests  of the Fund to recall the
security for voting  purposes.  Also,  the manager may abstain from voting under
certain  circumstances  or vote against items such as "Other  Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  The Registrant  maintains
disclosure  controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required  to be  disclosed  in the  Registrant's  filings  under the  Securities
Exchange  Act of  1934  and the  Investment  Company  Act of  1940 is  recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and  communicated  to  the  Registrant's  management,  including  its  principal
executive  officer and principal  financial  officer,  as appropriate,  to allow
timely decisions  regarding required  disclosure.  The Registrant's  management,
including the principal  executive officer and the principal  financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures,  no matter how well designed
and  operated,  can provide only  reasonable  assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within  90 days  prior to the  filing  date of this  Shareholder  Report on Form
N-CSR,  the Registrant had carried out an evaluation,  under the supervision and
with  the   participation   of  the  Registrant's   management,   including  the
Registrant's   principal  executive  officer  and  the  Registrant's   principal
financial  officer,  of the  effectiveness  of the design and  operation  of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on such evaluation,  the
Registrant's   principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer
concluded  that  the  Registrant's   disclosure   controls  and  procedures  are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.  There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's  internal  controls or in other  factors  that could  significantly
affect the  internal  controls  subsequent  to the date of their  evaluation  in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
