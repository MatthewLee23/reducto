CHAIRMAN'S LETTER
- -----------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report of the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds, for the period ending April 30, 2004.
The report includes a listing of the Funds' investments and their financial
statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide current income exempt from
regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific Fund, current income
exempt from that state's income taxes.

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds (maturities between three and
eight years) because our experience and research indicate strongly that this
maturity range has historically offered the best risk/reward profile on the
yield curve, providing much of the return of longer-term bonds -- with less
volatility and risk.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior tax-exempt current income over the long
term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS Portfolio Commentaries
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

          We are pleased to report that on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, all
          three of Neuberger Berman's Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds
          delivered positive returns and outperformed the Lehman Brothers
          10-Year Municipal Bond Index benchmark in fiscal first-half 2004.

          We enjoyed a stable bond market through the first five months of this
          six-month reporting period. However, when a strong March jobs report
          was released in early April and investors became convinced the Federal
          Reserve would begin tightening this summer, bond prices came under
          heavy pressure. Municipal securities' performance tracked that of the
          broad fixed-income market throughout this reporting period.

          Robust third-quarter 2003 GDP growth had inspired us to assume a
          defensive posture long before the March jobs reports rattled the
          fixed-income markets. We reduced the portfolios' weighted average
          maturity and duration to hedge against interest rate risk. To enhance
          liquidity, we upgraded the credit quality of all the portfolios. These
          strategies could not offer total protection against April's volatile
          fixed-income markets, but going forward, we believe our more defensive
          posture will help preserve capital in what is likely to remain an
          unsettled market environment for at least the next several months.

          Looking ahead, we believe the fixed-income markets will remain
          volatile for at least the next several months as investors continue to
          ponder how much the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest
          rates. We believe the Fed will take a cautious, measured approach,
          tapping lightly on the monetary brakes this summer and then waiting
          for the election year dust to settle. If economic growth begins to
          moderate in second-half 2004, we believe the threat of inflation will
          diminish and that Fed rate hikes may be more modest than the bond
          market is currently anticipating. We will remain defensively postured
          until we see solid evidence that the municipal bond market is firming.

          (AMEX: NBH)

          For the six months ended April 30, 2004, on a Net Asset Value (NAV)
          basis, the Intermediate Municipal Fund returned 2.20% compared to the
          Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index's 0.92% return.

          As of April 30, 2004, the portfolio was comprised of 75.1% revenue
          bonds, 23.3% general obligation bonds, and 1.6% cash and cash
          equivalents. Bonds subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
          equaled 12.5% of assets. At the close of the reporting period, the
          Fund's duration was 6.6 years, and the portfolio's leverage position
          was 37.7% of net assets.

          (AMEX: NBW)

          For the six months ended April 30, 2004, on a Net Asset Value (NAV)
          basis, the California Intermediate Municipal Fund returned 1.82%
          compared to the Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index's 0.92% return.

          As of April 30, 2004, the portfolio was comprised of 87.5% revenue
          bonds, 10.8% general obligation bonds, and 1.7% cash and cash
          equivalents. Bonds subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
          equaled 13.2% of assets. At the close of the reporting period, the
          Fund's duration was 6.6 years, and the portfolio's leverage position
          was 37.9% of net assets.

          Shortly after the close of first-half fiscal 2004, California
          successfully issued $7.9 billion in Economic Recovery Bonds. The issue
          was over-subscribed at prices reflecting investor confidence that
          California will effectively address its structural budget deficit.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS
- --------------------------------

          +    Investments by each Fund are valued daily by obtaining bid price
               quotations from independent pricing services on all securities
               available in each service's data base. For all other securities
               requiring daily quotations, bid prices are obtained from
               principal market makers in those securities or, if quotations are
               not available, by a method the Board of Directors of Neuberger
               Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
               ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc.
               ("Intermediate"), or Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
               Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund",
               collectively, the "Funds") (each a "Board"), believes accurately
               reflects fair value. Numerous factors may be considered when
               determining the fair value of a security, including available
               analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
               whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other
               securities outstanding. Short-term debt securities with less than
               60 days until maturity may be valued at cost which, when combined
               with interest earned, approximates market value.

          @    Municipal securities held by the Funds are within the four
               highest rating categories (with respect to at least 80% of total
               assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating
               organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
               Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where
               not rated, are determined by the Funds' investment manager to be
               of comparable quality. Approximately 79%, 74%, and 54% of the
               municipal securities held by California, Intermediate, and New
               York, respectively, have credit enhancement features backing
               them, which the Funds may rely on, such as letters of credit,
               insurance, or guarantees. Without these credit enhancement
               features the securities may or may not meet the quality standards
               of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by securities in
               escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies,
               or instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay
               the periodic interest due and the principal of these bonds.
               Putable bonds give the Funds the right to sell back the issue on
               the date specified.

          ++   Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

          **   Security exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
               1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
               registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under
               Rule 144A. At April 30, 2004, these securities amounted to
               $2,548,000 or 0.9% of net assets for Intermediate.

          ~    Security purchased on a when-issued basis. At April 30, 2004,
               these securities amounted to $1,100,000 and $400,000 for
               Intermediate and New York, respectively.

          ~~   Security is segregated as collateral for when-issued purchase
               commitments.

          ^^   Not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

               NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

          1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund
               Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund
               Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
               Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund",
               collectively, the "Funds") were organized as Maryland
               corporations on July 29, 2002. California and New York are
               registered as non-diversified, closed-end management investment
               companies and Intermediate is registered as a diversified,
               closed-end management investment company under the Investment
               Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Fund's Board of Directors
               may classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock
               into one or more classes of preferred stock without the approval
               of shareholders.

               The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
               accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
               requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc. ("Management") to make
               estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial
               statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

          2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as
               indicated in the notes following the Funds' Schedule of
               Investments.

          3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities
               transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income,
               including accretion of discount (adjusted for original issue
               discount, where applicable) and amortization of premium, where
               applicable, is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and
               losses from securities transactions are recorded on the basis of
               identified cost and stated in the Statements of Operations.

          4    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the policy of each Fund to continue
               to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with
               the provisions available to certain investment companies, as
               defined in applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code, and
               to make distributions of investment company taxable income and
               net capital gains (after reduction for any amounts available for
               U.S. Federal income tax purposes as capital loss carryforwards)
               sufficient to relieve them from all, or substantially all, U.S.
               Federal income taxes. Accordingly, each Fund paid no U.S. Federal
               income taxes and no provision for U.S. Federal income taxes was
               required.

          5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns
               income, net of expenses, daily on its investments. It is the
               policy of each Fund to declare and pay dividends to common
               shareholders from net investment income on a monthly basis.
               Distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, are
               normally distributed in December. Income dividends and capital
               gain distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
               ex-dividend date. To the extent each Fund's net realized capital
               gains, if any, can be offset

               by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not
               to distribute such gains. Dividends and distributions to
               preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as described in
               Note A-7. At October 31, 2003, the capital loss carryforwards for
               each Fund were as follows:

               Each Fund distinguishes between dividends on a tax basis and a
               financial reporting basis and only distributions in excess of tax
               basis earnings and profits are reported in the financial
               statements as a tax return of capital. Differences in the
               recognition or classification of income between the financial
               statements and tax earnings and profits which result in temporary
               over-distributions for financial statement purposes are
               classified as distributions in excess of net investment income or
               accumulated net realized gains in the components of net assets on
               the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

               Subsequent to April 30, 2004, each Fund declared dividends to
               common shareholders from their net investment income payable June
               15, 2004, to shareholders of record on May 27, 2004, with an

          6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Some bills are applicable to multiple funds.
               Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that
               Fund. Expenses borne by the complex of related investment
               companies, which includes open-end and closed-end investment
               companies for which Management serves as investment manager, that
               are not directly attributed to a Fund, are allocated among the
               Funds and the other investment companies in the complex or series
               thereof, on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
               appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in
               the complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

          7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds

               All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference
               of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends,
               whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but excluding
               interest thereon ("Liquidation Value"). Dividends to AMPS
               shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily. It is the
               policy of each Fund to pay dividends every 7 days for each Fund's
               AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS Series B,
               unless in a special rate period.

               In the absence of a special rate period, dividend rates are reset
               every 7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results
               of an auction. Each Fund has approved a special rate period for
               its AMPS Series A of 728 days for California and New York and 546

               The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or
               in part, on the second business day preceding any dividend
               payment date at Liquidation Value.

               The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to
               the AMPS. Failure to comply with these restrictions could
               preclude the Funds from declaring any distributions to common
               shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could trigger
               the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value.

               The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and,
               unless otherwise required by law, will vote with holders of
               common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
               separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
               holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
               entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to
               elect a majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund failed to
               pay dividends on AMPS for two consecutive years.

          8    ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed
               to pay all organizational expenses and the amount by which each
               Fund's offering costs for common stock (other than sales load)
               exceed $0.03 per share. The costs incurred by management were
               $261,029, $276,501, and $289,752 for California, Intermediate and
               New York, respectively. Offering costs for common stock paid by
               each Fund were charged as a reduction of common stock
               paid-in-capital at the completion of each Fund's offerings and
               amounted to $203,759, $620,459, and $167,159 for California,
               Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

               Additionally, offering costs of $154,612, $337,770, and $143,704
               and sales loads of $590,000, $1,794,000, and $482,500 for AMPS
               for California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, were
               charged as a reduction of common stock paid-in capital for each
               Fund's AMPS offering.

          9    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt
               securities held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be
               affected by economic developments, including those particular to
               a specific industry or region. The investment policies of
               California and New York involve investing substantially all of
               their assets in municipal bonds of issuers located in the state
               of California and the state of New York, respectively. This
               policy makes those Funds more susceptible to adverse economic,
               political, regulatory or other factors affecting the issuers of
               such municipal bonds than a fund that does not limit its
               investments to such issuers.

               NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER
               TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES:

               Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a
               Management Agreement. For such investment management services,
               each Fund pays Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of
               its

               following annual rates:

</Table>

               Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond
               October 31, 2011.

               For the six months ended April 30, 2004, such waived fees
               amounted to $198,343, $607,719, and $162,646 for California,
               Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

               Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an
               Administration Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an
               administration fee at the annual rate of 0.30% of its average
               daily Managed Assets under this agreement. Additionally,
               Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State
               Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
               Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services
               received under the agreement.

               On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC
               ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
               sub-adviser to each Fund, became indirect wholly owned
               subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a publicly-owned
               holding company ("the Transaction"). Upon completion of the
               Transaction, each Fund's management and sub-advisory agreements
               automatically terminated. To provide for continuity of
               management, the shareholders of each Fund voted on September 23,
               2003, to approve new management and sub-advisory agreements,
               which took effect upon closing of the Transaction. Neuberger is
               retained by Management to furnish it with investment
               recommendations and research information without added cost to
               each Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors
               of each Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

               Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with
               its custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected
               in the Statements of Operations under the caption Custodian fees,
               was a reduction of $193, $291, and $221 for California,
               Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

               In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund
               pays, through the auction agent, a service fee to each
               participating broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation
               preference of the AMPS held by the broker-dealer's customers. For
               any auction preceding a rate period of less than one year, the
               service fee is paid at the annual rate of 1/4 of 1%; for any
               auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the service
               fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the
               broker-dealer.

                                     NEUBERGER BERMAN APRIL 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

               Each Fund has paid Merrill Lynch a fee equal to 1/8 of 1% in
               connection with entering the special rate periods in return for
               which Merrill Lynch had agreed to pay dividends on the AMPS that,
               as a result of the auction, exceed a specified rate.

               In order to satisfy ratings agency requirements, each Fund is
               required to provide each rating agency a report on a monthly
               basis verifying that each Fund is maintaining eligible assets
               having a discounted value equal to or greater than the Preferred
               Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a minimum level set by
               each rating agency as one of the conditions to maintain the AAA
               rating on the AMPS. 'Discounted value' refers to the fact that
               the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
               calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face
               value, at a rate depending on their rating. Each Fund pays a fee
               to State Street, as Fund sub-administrator, for the preparation
               of this report.

+   Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
    changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
    fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
    purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
    common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
    Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
    obtained under each Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Results represent
    past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may be
    lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For each Fund, total
    return would have been lower if Management had not waived the investment
    management fee. Performance data current to the most recent month-end are

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
