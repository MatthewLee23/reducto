The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable by the average of total monthly  members'  capital.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

(a)   Annualized, except for organizational and offering expenses if applicable.

(b)   The Adviser waived $15,369 of management fees for the year ended March 31,
      2003. The net investment  loss prior to incentive  allocation  ratio would

      reimbursement  of deferred  expenses  (see Note 2f) during the years ended
      March 31, 2004 and 2005,  and agreed to forego  reimbursement  of deferred
      expenses  in each of those  years  also.  Reimbursement  to the Adviser of
      deferred  expenses is  included  in the expense  ratios for the periods in
      which such reimbursement was requested. Please see Note 2f for information

1. ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
investment  company and which has many of the  features of a private  investment
fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both  "accredited  investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and  "qualified  clients"  under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment  objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an  attractive,  long-term  rate  of  return,  on  an  absolute  as  well  as  a
risk-adjusted  basis,  with low performance  volatility and minimal  correlation
with the equity and fixed income  markets.  The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in approximately  25-50 partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio
Funds") managed by different  investment managers and (ii) construct a portfolio
employing  various  arbitrage and equity  strategies to achieve the risk control
benefits  of  diversification  together  with the  value of a hedged  investment
approach.

Effective  December  4,  2004,  Banc  of  America  Investment   Advisors,   Inc.
("Adviser")  (formerly  known as Liberty  Asset  Management  Company) is the SEC
registered   investment  adviser  to  the  Fund.  The  Adviser  is  an  indirect
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Bank  of  America  Corporation  ("BAC").  Prior  to
December 4, 2004, Columbia Management Advisors,  Inc. ("CMA") was the investment
adviser to the Fund.  Prior to April 1, 2004, CMA was an indirect,  wholly-owned
subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April
1, 2004,  FleetBoston  was acquired by BAC.  The Adviser has retained  Grosvenor
Capital Management,  L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the
Fund. The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated as special  members
(the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The  Fund's  investments  are  fair  valued  by the  Adviser  or  Subadviser  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably  determine the value of its investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments in Portfolio  Funds are generally  valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values,  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C. INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E. CASH

At September 30, 2005, a total of $2,038,412 in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust Company,  the Fund's custodian.  Of that amount,  $1,146,397 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

F. ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING EXPENSES

The Adviser entered into an expense  deferral  agreement (the "Expense  Deferral
Agreement") with the Fund dated December 19, 2002, as amended December 31, 2002,
whereby the Fund,  upon request of the Adviser,  agreed to repay $366,088 to the
Adviser for organizational and initial offering costs advanced by the Adviser on
behalf of the Fund, subject to certain conditions. Such repayment was contingent
upon the expenses of the Fund (exclusive of brokerage costs, interest,  taxes or
extraordinary expenses and management fees or performance-based fees paid by the
Fund),  including such repayment,  being limited to no more than 0.75% per annum
of  average  members'  capital  of the  Fund.  The  Expense  Deferral  Agreement
terminates  on April 1,  2006,  and the  Fund  has no  obligation  to pay to the
Adviser any  organizational  or initial offering costs still  outstanding to the
Adviser as of that date.  Expenses  deferred  pursuant to the  Expense  Deferral
Agreement  have been  treated as  contingent  liabilities  of the Fund until the
point at which the criteria  specified in the Expense  Deferral  Agreement  have
been satisfied. Upon satisfaction of the criteria, the expenses are reflected as
organizational  fees reimbursed to the Adviser.  During the year ended March 31,
2004, the Adviser requested  reimbursement of $73,930 in deferred expenses,  and
the Adviser agreed to permanently  forego  reimbursement  of $28,623 in deferred
expenses.   During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2005,  the  Adviser  requested
reimbursement  of  $220,497  in  deferred  expenses,  and this  amount  has been
reflected in the statement of operations as  organizational  fees  reimbursed to
Adviser.  The Adviser agreed to permanently  forego $43,038 of  reimbursement of
deferred  expenses  during the year ended March 31, 2005.  As of  September  30,
2005, no amounts remain outstanding pursuant to the Expense Deferral Agreement.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward  as of the end of the prior  Incentive  Period.  A  Member's  "Loss
Carryforward"  for the initial  Incentive  Period is zero and for each Incentive
Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward  as of the end of
the immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased or decreased,  but not
below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between the net losses over
net  profits  allocated  to the Member for the  current  Incentive  Period.  The
"Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would  receive if its Interest as of
the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted   appropriately  for  any
additional  contributions)  earned a rate of return equal to the  one-year  U.S.
Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar quarter and reset
on the  first  day of each  calendar  quarter.  The  Hurdle  Rate  Amount is not
cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The Hurdle Rate Amount for
March 31, 2005,  June 30, 2005,  and September 30, 2005 is 2.802%,  3.403%,  and
3.636% per annum,  respectively.  On June 30, 2005,  an incentive  allocation of
$1,689 was realized.  Additional capital of $397,451 would have been reallocable
to the  Special  Members  had the  Members'  measurement  period  for  incentive
allocation closed on September 30, 2005.

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)

3. MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase or distribution, and
the Member's  opening capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the
beginning of such Incentive Period,  will be allocated between the two Interests
in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest  that is  repurchased  or
distributed.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Each director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each
meeting attended. Any director or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund. All directors are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)  serves as
administrator  and  accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides
certain accounting,  record keeping, tax and investor related services. The Fund
pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily upon
month-end Members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

5. MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)

5. MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2005.  The  interests  redeemed  pursuant  to  such  tenders  are  shown  in the
Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined by the Board in its discretion

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

and such  repurchase  amount may  represent  only a small  portion of the Fund's
outstanding  Interests.  Because  the  Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds
themselves have limited liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund significant
repurchases.  Members whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the
risk that the Fund's members'  capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the
time  that  they  submit  their  request  for  repurchase  and  the  date of the
repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

7. INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)

8. LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund (the "Columbia  Group"),  entered into Assurances
of  Discontinuance  with the New  York  Attorney  General  ("NYAG")  (the  "NYAG
Settlement")  and  consented  to the  entry of  cease-and  desist  orders by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC") (the "SEC Order") in connection with
matters  related to late trading and market  timing of mutual funds  advised and
distributed by affiliates of the Adviser (the "Columbia  Funds").  The SEC Order
and the NYAG  Settlement  contain  substantially  the same terms and  conditions
outlined in the  agreements in principle  that Columbia  Group entered into with
the SEC and NYAG in March 2004. A copy of the SEC Orders is available on the SEC
website at  HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.  A copy of the NYAG  settlements is available as
part of the Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with these  matters,  various  parties  have filed suit  against
certain  Columbia  Funds,  the  Trustees  of  the  Columbia  Funds,  FleetBoston
Financial  Corporation  (the former  parent of the Adviser)  and its  affiliated
entities and/or Bank of America  Corporation and its affiliated  entities.  More
than 300 cases,  including those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the
Columbia  Funds,  their  Boards,   FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  and  its
affiliated  entities  and/or  Bank of  America  Corporation  and its  affiliated
entities,  have been  transferred to the Federal  District Court in Maryland and
consolidated in a  multi-district  proceeding.  Other actions against certain of
the Columbia  Funds,  advisers and  affiliated  entities,  alleging  among other
things  excessive fees and  inappropriate  use of fund assets for  distribution,
have been  consolidated  in the  Massachusetts  federal  court as In re Columbia
Entities Litigation on March 2, 2005. These actions are ongoing.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Effective October 1, 2005, the Fund received additional capital contributions of
$800,000.

The Fund files its complete  schedule of portfolio  holdings with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on
Form N-Q within  sixty days after the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is
available on the Commission's website at HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV, and may be reviewed
and  copied  at the  Commission's  Public  Reference  Room in  Washington,  D.C.
Information  on the  operation of the Public  Reference  Room may be obtained by
calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine how
to vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio  securities,  as  well as  information
relating to how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio  securities  during
the most recent  12-month period ended June 30, is available (i) without charge,
upon request, by calling 1-888-786-9977; and (ii) on the Commission's website at
