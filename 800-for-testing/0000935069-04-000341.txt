                         Report of Independent Auditors

To the Members and Board of Directors of
UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund") as of December 31, 2003,
and the related  statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended
and the  statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended. These financial  statements are the responsibility of the
Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on  these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our
procedures  included  confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2003,
by  correspondence  with  management  of the  investment  funds.  An audit  also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.
at December 31, 2003,  the results of its  operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended and the  changes  in its  members'  capital  for each of the two
years in the  period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States.

                                                            /s/Ernst & Young LLP

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1.    ORGANIZATION

         UBS  Technology  Partners,   L.L.C.  (the  "Fund")  (formerly,  UBS  PW
         Technology  Partners,  L.L.C.)  was  initially  organized  as a limited
         partnership  under the laws of Delaware  on  December  28, 1998 and was
         subsequently  reorganized  as a  limited  liability  company  effective
         October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered  under the Investment  Company
         Act  of  1940,   as  amended  (the  "1940  Act"),   as  a   closed-end,
         non-diversified,  management  investment company. The Fund's investment
         objective is to maximize capital  appreciation over the long-term.  The
         Fund pursues its investment objective by deploying its assets primarily
         among a select group of portfolio  managers who invest primarily in, or
         who have particular knowledge within, the technology sector. Generally,
         such  portfolio  managers  conduct their  investment  programs  through
         unregistered investment funds (collectively, the "Investment Funds") in
         which the Fund invests as a limited  partner or member along with other
         investors. The Fund commenced operations on April 1, 1999.

         The  Fund's  Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
         responsibility  to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The  Directors  have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the "UBSFA" or
         "Manager")  (formerly,  PW Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.),  a Delaware  limited
         liability  company and the Manager of the Fund,  to provide  investment
         advice   regarding   the   selection  of   Investment   Funds  and  the
         responsibility of the day-to-day management of the Fund.

         The Manager is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,
         Inc.,  which is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered
         as an investment adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be  accepted at such times as the  Manager  may  determine  and are
         generally  accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant
         to written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion.  The Manager expects that generally,
         it will  recommend to the  Directors  that the Fund offer to repurchase
         interests from Members twice in each year,  near mid-year and year-end.
         Members can only transfer or assign their  membership  interests (i) by
         operation  of law  pursuant  to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
         dissolution  of a Member,  or (ii)  with the  written  approval  of the
         Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute discretion.

   2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         a.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Manager as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal  period in
         accordance  with the valuation  principles set forth below or as may be
         determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the
         Directors.

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         a.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms and
         conditions  of  the  respective   operating   agreements  and  offering
         memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds
         are carried at fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata interest
         in the net  assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations  utilize
         financial  information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of
         management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
         Investment  Funds'  managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'
         agreements.  The  underlying  investments of each  Investment  Fund are
         accounted  for at fair value as  described  in each  Investment  Fund's
         financial statements.

         Distributions  received or withdrawn from Investment Funds,  whether in
         the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of the
         investment's cost.

         b.   INCOME RECOGNITION

         Interest  income is recorded on the accrual  basis.  Realized gains and
         losses  from  Investment  Fund   transactions  are  calculated  on  the
         identified cost basis.

         c.   FUND COSTS

         The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but
         not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to
         portfolio  transactions  and  positions for the Fund's  account;  legal
         fees;  accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing
         the Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance;  registration expenses;
         certain organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related
         expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with
         respect to  communications  to  Members;  and other  types of  expenses
         approved  by the  Directors.  Offering  costs are charged to capital as
         incurred.

         d.   INCOME TAXES

         No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes
         has been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax.  Each
         Member is  individually  required  to report on its own tax  return its
         distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

         The Fund has  reclassified  $7,158,635 and $29,297,626 from accumulated
         net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments,
         respectively,  to net  capital  contributions  during  the  year  ended
         December  31,  2003.  The   reclassification  was  to  reflect,  as  an
         adjustment to net capital  contributions,  the amount of taxable income
         or loss that have  been  allocated  to the  Fund's  Members  and had no
         effect on net assets.

                                                                               7

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         e.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account  which pays money  market rates and are  accounted  for at cost
         plus accrued  interest which is included in interest  receivable on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         f.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
         connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy  that its
         custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities,  the
         fair value of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount of the  repurchase
         transaction,  including accrued  interest,  at all times. If the seller
         defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines, realization of
         the  collateral  by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December
         31, 2003 there were no open repurchase agreements.

         g.   USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Manager
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Manager believes
         that  the  estimates   utilized  in  preparing  the  Fund's   financial
         statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
         differ from these estimates.

   3.    MANAGEMENT FEE, PERFORMANCE BONUS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         UBSFA provides certain  management and  administrative  services to the
         Fund, including,  among other things,  providing office space and other
         support  services.  In consideration  for such services,  the Fund pays
         UBSFA a monthly  management  fee (the "Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of
         the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets  attributable to the Manager's
         capital account.  The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's assets and
         debited against the Members' capital accounts,  excluding the Manager's
         capital  account.  A  portion  of  the  fee is  paid  by  UBSFA  to its
         affiliates.

         UBS Financial  Services Inc.  ("UBS FSI")  (formerly,  UBS  PaineWebber
         Inc.),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a
         placement  agent for the Fund,  without special  compensation  from the
         Fund,  and  bears  its own  costs  associated  with its  activities  as
         placement agent.  Placement fees, if any, charged on contributions  are
         debited  against  the  contribution   amounts,   to  arrive  at  a  net
         subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
         the Fund.

         The net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  Members'  capital  derived  from
         operations  (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital
         accounts of all Members on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the Fee which
         is  similarly  allocated  to all  Members  other  than the  Manager  as
         described  above.  In  accordance  with the Limited  Liability  Company
         Agreement,  the  Manager  is then  allocated  an  amount  based  on the
         performance of the Fund (the  "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement
         Period,  as defined in the  Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e., the period
         commencing on the admission of a Member to the Fund, and

                                                                               8

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3.    MANAGEMENT FEE, PERFORMANCE BONUS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
         (CONTINUED)

         thereafter  each  period  commencing  on the  day  following  the  last
         Measurement  Period and ending generally on the first to occur of (1) a
         fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial redemption).  The Performance
         Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

         The  Performance  Bonus is equal to 1% of the  balance of the  Member's
         capital  account at the end of the  Measurement  Period,  provided that
         appreciation  in the Member's  capital  account (net of any Performance
         Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold return.  The threshold return is
         the amount that a Member  would have earned for a fiscal year if it had
         received an  annualized  rate of return of 20% on its  opening  capital
         account balance,  as adjusted.  No Performance Bonus was earned for the
         years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

         Each Director who is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined
         by the 1940 Act,  receives an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for
         each meeting attended.  Any Director who is an "interested person" does
         not receive any annual or other fee from the Fund.  All  Directors  are
         reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. Total
         amounts  expensed  related to  Directors by the Fund for the year ended
         December 31, 2003 were $22,634.

         PFPC Trust Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian
         of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund.

         PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Administrator
         and Accounting Agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides certain
         administrative,  accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services. PFPC Inc. receives a monthly fee primarily based upon (i) the
         average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and
         (ii) the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain other  investment
         funds  sponsored  or advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or it  affiliates.
         Additionally,  the  Fund  reimburses  certain  out of  pocket  expenses
         incurred by PFPC Inc.

   4.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases and sales of  Investment  Funds for the year ended
         December  31,  2003,   amounted  to  $153,550,000   and   $331,727,537,
         respectively.

         The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


I.   GENERAL GUIDELINES AND POLICY

UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser")  votes  proxies  for each fund (the
"Fund")  for  which it acts as the  Adviser.  Certain  of the Funds are funds of
funds that invest  primarily in unregistered  investment  vehicles  ("Investment
Funds") which have investors other than the Fund. Each of these Funds may invest
a majority  of its assets in  non-voting  securities  of  Investment  Funds.  In
addition,  Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors  for
vote.  If an  Investment  Fund submits a matter to a Fund for vote (and the Fund
holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund),  The Adviser will vote on the
matter  in a way that it  believes  is in the best  interest  of the Fund and in
accordance with these policies and procedures.

     In voting proxies,  the Adviser is guided by general fiduciary  principles.
The  Adviser's  goal is to act  prudently,  solely in the best  interest of each
client.  The Adviser  attempts  to  consider  all factors of its vote that could
affect the value of the  investment  and will vote proxies in the manner that it
believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize shareholder values.

     It is the  Adviser's  general  policy,  absent a  particular  reason to the
contrary,  to vote with management's  recommendations on routine matters.  Other
matters will be voted on a case-by-case basis.

II.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     In  furtherance of the Adviser's goal to vote proxies in the best interests
of clients,  the Adviser  follows  procedures  designed to identify  and address
material  conflicts that may arise between the Adviser's  interests and those of
its clients before voting proxies on behalf of such clients.

(1)  Procedures for Identifying Conflicts of Interest.

     The  Adviser  relies on the  following  to seek to  identify  conflicts  of
     interest with respect to proxy voting:
<PAGE>

     The  Adviser's  employees  are under an  obligation  (i) to be aware of the
     potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser with respect
     to voting  proxies  on behalf  of  client  accounts  both as a result of an
     employee's personal relationships and due to special circumstances that may
     arise  during the  conduct  of the  Adviser's  business,  and (ii) to bring
     conflicts of interest of which they become  aware to the  attention of Ruth
     Goodstein and Mark Goldstein.

(2)  Procedures  for  Assessing  Materiality  of  Conflicts  of Interest and for
     Addressing Material Conflicts of Interest

     A.   All conflicts of interest  identified must be brought to the attention
          of Ms. Goodstein and Mr. Goldstein for resolution.

     B.   Ms. Goodstein and Mr.  Goldstein will work with appropriate  personnel
          of the  Adviser  to  determine  whether  a  conflict  of  interest  is
          material.  A conflict of interest will be  considered  material to the
          extent that it is  determined  that such conflict has the potential to
          influence  the  Adviser's  decision-making  in voting the  proxy.  All
          materiality  determinations  will be  based  on an  assessment  of the
          particular  facts and  circumstances.  The  Adviser  shall  maintain a
          written record of all materiality determinations.

     C.   If it is determined  that a conflict of interest is not material,  the
          Adviser  may  vote  proxies   notwithstanding  the  existence  of  the
          conflict.

     D.   If it is  determined  that a conflict  of interest  is  material,  the
          Adviser's Legal Department will work with appropriate personnel of the
          Adviser to agree upon a method to resolve  such  conflict  of interest
          before  voting  proxies  affected by the  conflict of  interest.  Such
          methods may include:

          o    disclosing  the conflict to clients and  obtaining  their consent
               before voting  (which  consent in the case of a Fund with a board
               of directors may be obtained from the Fund's board of directors);

          o    engaging  another party on behalf of the client to vote the proxy
               on its behalf;

          o    engage a third  party to  recommend  a vote with  respect  to the
               proxy based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

          o    such   other   method   as  is  deemed   appropriate   under  the
               circumstances given the nature of the conflict.

          The  Adviser  shall  maintain a written  record of the method  used to
          resolve a material conflict of interest.


     III. RECORD KEEPING AND OVERSIGHT

          The Adviser  shall  maintain the following  records  relating to proxy
          voting:

          o    a copy of these policies and procedures;


<PAGE>

          o    a copy of each proxy form (as voted);

          o    a copy of each proxy  solicitation  (including proxy  statements)
               and related materials with regard to each vote;

          o    documentation  relating to the  identification  and resolution of
               conflicts of  interest;

          o    any  documents  created by the  Adviser  that were  material to a
               proxy  voting  decision or that  memorialized  the basis for that
               decision; and

          o    a copy of each written client request for  information on how the
               Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the client,  and a copy of any
               written  response by the Adviser to any  (written or oral) client
               request  for  information  on how the  Adviser  voted  proxies on
               behalf of the requesting client.

          Such records shall be maintained and preserved in an easily accessible
place for a period of not less than five years  from the end of the fiscal  year
during which the last entry was made on such record,  the first two years in the
Adviser's office.

          In  addition,  with  respect  to  proxy  voting  records  for any fund
registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, the Adviser shall maintain
such  records  as  are   necessary  to  allow  such  fund  to  comply  with  its
recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure obligations under applicable laws, rules
and regulations.

          In lieu of keeping copies of proxy statements, the Adviser may rely on
proxy  statements filed on the EDGAR system as well as on third party records of
proxy  statements  and votes cast if the third party  provides an undertaking to
provide the documents promptly upon request.

            UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT GROUP

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (the "Code") for the UBS Financial Services Inc.
Alternative Investment Group investment companies (each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer and
other persons performing similar functions, each of whom is listed on Exhibit A
(the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT  CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST


         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his
position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. Policies and procedures applicable to the Fund and the Fund's
investment adviser (collectively, the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or
identify and correct, violations of these provisions. The



<PAGE>

Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and the circumstances they cover fall outside of the parameters of
the Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board that
the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes of ethics.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that
the Code cannot cover every possible scenario. The overarching principle of the
Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships
               improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
               reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
               personally to the detriment of the Fund;

          o    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
               the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
               than the benefit of the Fund;

          o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
               made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
               others to trade personally in contemplation of the market effect
               of such transactions; and

          o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports
               of potential violations that are made in good faith.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

          o    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
               disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

          o    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
               others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
               within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members
               and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
               organizations; and

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

          o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
               area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
               of the Fund and the Adviser and take other appropriate steps with
               the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
               understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund
               files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
               communications made by the Fund; and

          o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
               compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon
               becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that
               he has received, read, and understands the Code;

          o    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with
               the requirements of the Code; and

          o    notify Herb Janick or such other representative(s) of the UBS
               Financial Services Inc. Legal Department as may be designated
               from time to time ("Counsel") promptly if he knows of any
               violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of
               the Code.

         Counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific situations in
which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret the
Code in any particular situation. However, approvals, interpretations or waivers
sought by any Covered Officer will be considered by a committee designated by
the Fund's Board (the "Committee"). In the absence of a designation, the
Committee shall be the Board.

         The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
the Code:

          o    Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
               potential violations reported to him;

          o    if, after such investigation, Counsel believes that no violation
               has occurred, Counsel is not required to take any further action;

          o    any matter that Counsel believes is a violation will be reported
               to the Committee;

          o    if the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
               will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
               consider appropriate action, which may include: review of, and
               appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
               notification to appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its
               board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

          o    the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as
               appropriate; and

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

          o    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required,
               will be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies and procedures of the Fund, the Adviser, principal underwriter, or
other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities
of the Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are superceded by the
Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of the
Code. The Fund's, the Adviser's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act and the Adviser's additional policies and procedures are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of the Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Except as to Exhibit A, the Code may not be amended except in written
form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the
Fund's Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall
not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and their counsel,
the appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel and the Adviser.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
