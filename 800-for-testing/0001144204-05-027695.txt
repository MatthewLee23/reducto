The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
consist of Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the Dominican
Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and Venezuela. The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in a broad
range of securities of issuers including U.S.-based companies, which engage in
substantial trade with and derive substantial revenue from operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

August 3, 2005

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

We are pleased to present our annual report for the period ending June 30, 2005.
At the end of the fiscal year, The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's net assets
were $12,291,956, or $7.33 per share, compared with $9,109,162, or $5.43 per
share, at the beginning of the period. This represents a gain of 35.0% in net
asset value. The Fund's share price rose from $4.87 per share to $6.30 over the
same 12-month period; an increase of 29.4%. In the month since the end of our
fiscal year, the fund's net asset value has climbed to $7.83 per share, a record
high, and our net assets have moved above $13 million for the first time.

Portfolio Commentary

When we created the Fund we believed then, and are even more convinced now, that
the most compelling investment opportunities will be in Cuba. Since the U.S.
embargo with that country is still in place, however, we have not changed our
initial "indirect" investment strategy. That is first, to identify companies
which will benefit from a resumption of trade with Cuba and second, to
concentrate on companies which we believe have good prospects even if there is
no U.S. policy change with Cuba. This approach has been very successful; from
inception the Fund's net asset value is up 86.8% (adjusted for distributions).
In the event the embargo is lifted, we will then seek to make some direct
investments in Cuba, possibly as joint ventures. In that connection we have been
exploring investment opportunities within the Cuban-American business community,
mostly in South Florida where we are based. We have also had preliminary
conversations with the officers of a number of our portfolio companies.

A look at our top ten holdings provides some examples of the current investment
strategy.

Our largest position continues to be Florida East Coast Industries (FLA). The
company has two main businesses: Flagler Development Company and Florida East
Coast Railway, which runs between Jacksonville and Miami. Last year FLA
appointed a new chairman, Adolfo Henriques, a prominent Cuban-American. The
company has been turning in excellent results; for the second quarter Mr.
Henriques recently stated that "the railroad posted


                                      -3-

================================================================================

double-digit percentage growth in revenues and operating profit." The quarterly
dividend was increased by 20%, an increase that he said was a reflection of his
and the board's confidence in the company's future and financial strength.

We believe FLA is a strong candidate to run a rail-barge service between Florida
and Cuba in the future. The railroad track used in Cuba is the same gauge as the
U.S.; the future possibilities are, of course, obvious.

Of our ten largest holdings, five made record highs this year, including our
second largest holding, Seaboard (SEB), which we started buying at $262.50 per
share in 1995. It is currently changing hands above $1,700 per share. SEB's
marine division provides containerized shipping service between the United
States, the Caribbean Basin and Central and South America. We believe the
company is strongly positioned for the resumption of trade with Cuba.

Also among our largest holdings making new highs during the fiscal year are:
Consolidated Water (CWCO), based in the Cayman Islands; Florida Rock Industries
(FRK), which has plans to sell aggregates and concrete products in free Cuba,
much needed materials for the reconstruction of the country; Watsco Incorporated
(WSO), which we think would be a natural to sell air conditioning products in
Cuba and which in the meantime just reported record operating results; Garmin
Ltd. (GRMN), based in the Cayman Islands; and Latin American Equity Fund (LAQ).
LAQ is a closed-end fund trading at a 12% discount to net asset value. The Latin
American region has been benefiting from rising trade and investment; recently
The Economic Council for Latin American and the Caribbean forecast a growth rate
of 4.3% for 2005, which is slightly higher than the 4% forecast for the smaller
Caribbean component. Interestingly, they forecast a growth rate of 5% for Cuba
compared to 3% in 2004 and 2.9% in 2003.

Another company poised to take advantage of the cargo trade with Cuba is Trailer
Bridge (TRBR). TRBR provides integrated trucking and marine freight service to
and from all points in the lower 48 states and Puerto Rico. The company utilizes
its own trucks, drivers, trailers, containers and U.S.-flagged vessels to link
the mainland with Puerto Rico by marine facilities in Jacksonville and San Juan.
The company's ships are shallow-draft, which puts them in an excellent position
to operate in many of the ports of Cuba to which deep-draft vessels have limited
access. Cuba aside, the company is doing very well. Second quarter financial
results just came in with a 12.8% increase in revenue and a 207% increase in
operating income.

      --------------------------------------------------------------------

Premium/Discount

The Fund has traded at both premiums and discounts every year except the year of
inception in which it traded only at a premium. As I have stated before, we
believe that closed-end funds trading at discounts to net asset value represent
good value.

Further Information

Daily net asset values, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports and press
releases for the Fund are available on the Internet at www.herzfeld.com.

I would like to thank the members of the Board of Directors for their hard work
and guidance and also to thank my fellow stockholders for their continued
support and suggestions.

                         Sincerely,

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment policy is to invest at least 80% of its assets in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries. The Fund's
investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund
pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental and may not be changed without the approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At June 30, 2005, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands representing approximately 12% and
9% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is Investors Bank & Trust Company, based
in Boston, Massachusetts.

Security Valuation

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ national market or SmallCap market) are stated at the last
reported sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing
price); other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed
securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last
quoted bid price. Restricted securities and other securities for which
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by
the Board of Directors.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Income Recognition

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is recognized on an
accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized
over the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include
the portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments
denominated in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains
and losses on investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the year ended June 30, 2005, no distributions
were declared or paid to stockholders.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of
Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A "regulatory halt" on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July, 1995. As of June 30,
2005, the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which
approximates the bonds' fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the year
ended June 30, 2005 amounted to $153,114 of which $42,122 is payable at year
end.

During the year ended June 30, 2005, the Fund paid $12,672 of brokerage
commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended June 30, 2005, purchases and sales of investment
securities were $3,152,244 and $3,330,335, respectively.

At June 30, 2005, the Fund's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of
$5,511,849 and gross unrealized losses of $620,023, resulting in a net
unrealized gain of $4,891,826 for both financial statement and income tax
purposes.

NOTE 5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The cost basis of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower
than the cost basis for income tax purposes by approximately $55,000 due to wash
sale adjustments.

The income tax basis of distributive earnings as of June 30, 2005 include
$1,400,781 of accumulated net investment loss, $436,731 of accumulated net
realized loss on investments and $4,891,826 of net unrealized gain on
investments.

For the year ended June 30, 2005, the Fund utilized all of its capital loss
carryover of $605,665 remaining from the prior year.

responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial
highlights. Our procedures include confirmation of securities owned as of June
30, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. as of June 30, 2005, and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                     THE HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.

                       Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures

      The Board of Directors of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") hereby adopts the following policy and procedures with respect to voting
proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund:

Policy

      It is the policy of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") to
delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities
held by the Fund to the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") as a part of
the Adviser's general management of the Fund, subject to the Board's continuing
oversight.' The voting of proxies is an integral part of the investment
management services that the Adviser provides pursuant to the advisory contract.

      The Adviser may, but is not required to, delegate the responsibility for
voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund to a
sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser") retained to provide investment advisory services, if
applicable. If such responsibility is delegated to a Sub-Adviser, then the
Sub-Adviser shall assume the fiduciary duty and reporting responsibilities of
the Adviser under these policy guidelines.
<PAGE>

Fiduciary Duty

      The right to vote a proxy with respect to portfolio securities held by the
Fund is an asset of the Fund. The Adviser, to which authority to vote on behalf
of the Fund is delegated, acts as a fiduciary of the Fund and must vote proxies
in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Procedures

      The following are the procedures adopted by the Board for the
administration of this policy:

      A. Review of Adviser Proxy Voting Procedures. The Adviser with authority
to vote proxies on behalf of the Fund shall present to the Board its policies,
procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies at least annually, and must
notify the Board promptly of material changes to any of these documents.

      B. Voting Record Reporting. No less than annually, the Adviser shall
report to the Board a record of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio
securities of the Fund during the year. With respect to those proxies that the
Adviser has identified as involving a conflict of interest(2), the Adviser shall
submit a separate report indicating the nature of the conflict of interest and
how that conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy.

Revocation

      The delegation by the Board of the authority to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Fund is entirely voluntary and may be revoked by the
Board, in whole or in part, at any time.

Annual Filing

      The Fund shall file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
its portfolio securities during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX not later than August 31 of each year.

Disclosures

      The Fund shall include in its annual report to stockholders:

      A description of this policy and of the policies and procedures used by
the Adviser to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities
(3); and

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website(4).

      The Fund shall also include in its annual and semi-annual reports to
stockholders:

      A statement disclosing that a description of the policies and procedures
used by or on behalf of the Fund to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Funds is available without charge, upon request, by
calling the Fund's toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(5)

      A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted
proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period
ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(6)
<PAGE>

Review of Policy.

      At least annually, the Board shall review this Policy to determine its
sufficiency and shall make and approve any changes that it deems necessary from
time to time

- ----------
(1)   This policy is adopted for the purpose of the disclosure requirements
      adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Release Nos. 33-8188,
      34-47304, IC-25922.

(2)   As it is used in this document, the term "conflict of interest" refers to
      a situation in which the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or affiliated persons of
      the Adviser or Sub-Adviser have a financial interest in a matter presented
      by a proxy other than the obligation it incurs as investment adviser to
      the Fund which compromises the Adviser's or Sub-Adviser's independence of
      judgment and action with respect to the voting of the proxy.

(3)   This disclosure shall be included in the annual report next filed by the
      Fund, on Form N-CSR on or after July 1, 2003.

                        THOMAS J. HERZFELD ADVISORS, INC.

                                  PROXY VOTING

                             POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I.    POLICY

Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. (the "Adviser") acts as discretionary
investment adviser for various clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and clients governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").

Selected clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. have elected
to have the Adviser vote proxies or act on the other shareholder actions on
their behalf, while other clients vote proxies themselves.

When voting proxies or acting on corporate actions for clients, the Adviser's
utmost concern is that all decisions be made in the best interest of its clients
(for ERISA accounts, plan beneficiaries and participants, in accordance with the
letter and spirit of ERISA). The Adviser will act in a manner deemed prudent and
diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the assets of
its clients' accounts.

II.   PURPOSE

The purpose of these Policies and Procedures is to memorialize the procedures
and policies adopted by the Adviser to enable it to comply with its
responsibilities and the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"). These Policies and Procedures
also reflect the fiduciary standards and responsibilities set forth by the
Department of Labor for ERISA accounts.

III.  PROCEDURES

Cecilia Gondor, Executive Vice President of the Adviser, is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that all proxies received by the Adviser are voted in a
timely manner and voted consistently across all portfolios. Although many proxy
proposals can be voted in accordance with the Adviser's established guidelines
(see Section V. below) (the "Guidelines"), the Adviser recognizes that some
proposals require special consideration, which may dictate that the Adviser
makes an exception to the Guidelines.
<PAGE>

Cecilia Gondor is also responsible for ensuring that all corporate actions
received by the Adviser are addressed in a timely manner and consistent action
is taken across all portfolios.

      A. Conflicts of Interest. Where a proxy proposal raises a material
conflict of interest between the Adviser's interests and that of one or more its
clients, the Adviser shall resolve such conflict in the manner described below.

            1. Vote in Accordance with the Guidelines. To the extent that the
Adviser has little or no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect
to the proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such
pre-determined voting policy.

            2. Obtain Consent of Clients. To the extent that the Adviser has
discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the proposal in
question, the Adviser shall disclose the conflict to the relevant clients and
obtain their consent to the proposed vote prior to voting the securities. The
disclosure to the clients will include sufficient detail regarding the matter to
be voted on and the nature of our conflict that the clients would be able to
make an informed decision regarding the vote. When a client does not respond to
such a conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser will
abstain from voting the securities held by that client's account.

      B. Limitations. In certain circumstances, in accordance with a client's
investment advisory contract (or other written directive) or where the Adviser
has determined that it is in the client's best interest, the Adviser will not
vote proxies received. The following are some circumstances where the Adviser
will limit its role in voting proxies received on client securities:

            1. Client Maintains Proxy Voting Authority: Where a client has not
specifically delegated the authority to vote proxies to the Adviser or that it
has delegated the right to vote proxies to a third party, the Adviser will not
vote the securities and will direct the relevant custodian to send the proxy
material directly to the client. If any proxy material is received by the
Adviser, it will promptly be forwarded to the client.

            2. Terminated Account: Once a client account has been terminated
with the Adviser in accordance with its investment advisory agreement, the
Adviser will not vote any proxies received after the termination. However, the
client may specify in writing that proxies should be directed to the client for
action.

            3. Limited Value: If the Adviser concludes that the client's
economic interest or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or
insignificant, the Adviser will abstain from voting a client's proxies. The
Adviser does not vote proxies received for securities which are no longer held
by the client's account. In addition, the Adviser generally does not vote
securities where the economic value of the securities in the client's account is
less than $500.

            4. Securities Lending Programs: When securities are out on loan,
they are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in
its discretion. However, where the Adviser determines that a proxy vote (or
shareholder action) is materially important to the client's account, the Adviser
may recall the security.

            5. Unjustifiable Costs: In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, the Adviser may abstain from voting where the cost of
voting a client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits of the proxy
proposal.

IV.   RECORD KEEPING

In accordance with Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, the Adviser will maintain
for the time periods set forth in the Rule (i) these proxy voting procedures and
policies, and amendments thereto; (ii) all proxy statements received regarding
client securities (provided however, that the Adviser may rely on the proxy
statement filed on EDGAR as its records)(1); (iii) a record of votes cast on
behalf of clients; (iv) records of client requests for proxy voting information;
(v) any documents prepared by the adviser that were material to making a
decision how to vote or that memorialized the basis for the decision; and (vi)
records relating to requests made to clients regarding conflicts of interest in
voting the proxy.
<PAGE>

The Adviser will describe in its Part II of Form ADV (or other brochure
fulfilling the requirement of Rule 204-3) its proxy voting policies and
procedures and advising clients how they may obtain information on how the
Adviser voted their securities. Clients may obtain information on how their
securities were voted or a copy of our Policies and Procedures by written
request addressed to the Adviser.

V.    GUIDELINES

Each proxy issue will be considered individually. The following guidelines are a
partial list to be used in voting proposals contained in the proxy statements,
but will not be used as rigid rules.

           c.  Proposals to require super majority votes;

           d.  Proposals requesting excessive increases in authorized common or preferred shares where
               management provides no explanation for the use or need for these additional shares;

           e.  Proposals regarding "poison pill" provisions; and

           f.  Permitting "green mail".

           Africa.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)        Election of directors recommended by management, except if there is a proxy fight.                     Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)        Election of auditors recommended by management, unless seeking to replace if there exists a            Approve
           dispute over policies.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5)        Date and place of annual meeting.                                                                      Approve

(6)        Limitation on charitable contributions or fees paid to lawyers.                                        Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7)        Ratification of directors' actions on routine matters since previous annual meeting.                   Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8)        Confidential voting                                                                                    Approve
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

- ----------
      (1) Because the Adviser primarily invests its clients' assets in
securities of foreign issuers, the Adviser generally has not been receiving
proxy statements from such issuers because the laws of the countries in which
these issuers are domiciled respecting delivery of proxy statements to
shareholders are different than those of the U.S.
<PAGE>

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                                                            <C>
Confidential voting is most often proposed by shareholders as a means of eliminating undue management
pressure on shareholders regarding their vote on proxy issues.

The Adviser will generally approve these proposals as shareholders can later divulge their votes to
management on a selective basis if a legitimate reason arises.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9)        Limiting directors' liability                                                                           Approve

Preemptive rights give current shareholders the opportunity to maintain their current percentage ownership
through any subsequent equity offerings. These provisions are no longer common in the U.S., and can restrict
management's ability to raise new capital.

The Adviser approves the elimination of preemptive rights, but will oppose the elimination of limited
preemptive rights, e.g., on proposed issues representing more than an acceptable level of total dilution.

                              EXHIBIT 99. CODE ETH.

                       HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

VI.   Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

            This code of ethics (the "Code") for the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a closed-end investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act"), applies to the Fund's
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the "Covered Officers" each
of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

            o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships;

            o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a registrant files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

            o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

            o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

            o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

            Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

VII.  Covered Officers Honest and Ethical Conduct and Ethically Handling Actual
      and Apparent Conflicts of Interest

            Overview. The Covered Officers shall conduct their activities on
behalf of the Fund in an honest and ethical manner. A "conflict of interest"
occurs when a Covered Officer's private interest interferes with the interests
of, or his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise
if a Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of his position with the Fund.

            Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and the investment adviser's
compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall
outside of the parameters of this Code.

            Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and the investment adviser, of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser and the Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers
in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund
and the adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it
is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors ("Board") that the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment
companies covered by this or other codes.

            Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

                                     * * * *
<PAGE>

            Each Covered Officer must not:

            o     use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

            o     cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; and

            o     use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
                  others to trade personally in contemplation of the market
                  effect of such transactions.

            There are some conflict of interest situations that should be
reviewed by the Fund's legal counsel, if material. Examples of these include:

            o     service as a director on the board of any public or private
                  company;

            o     receipt of gifts, in excess of reasonable or
                  business-appropriate;

            o     the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                  the Fund has current or prospective business dealings unless
                  such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

            o     any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                  administrator or any affiliated person thereof; and

            o     a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

VIII. Disclosure and Compliance

            o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
                  disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund.

            o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or
                  cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Board and independent auditor, and to government regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations.

            o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Fund and the adviser with the goal of
                  promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
                  disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with,
                  or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
                  by the Fund.

            o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IX.   Reporting and Accountability

            Each Covered Officer must:

            o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he has received, read, and understands the Code;
<PAGE>

            o     annually affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
                  requirements of the Code and report on the Covered Officer's
                  affiliations and relationships;

            o     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                  employee of the Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of
                  potential violations that are made in good faith; and

            o     notify the Fund's legal counsel promptly if he knows of any
                  violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
                  of the Code.

            The Fund's legal counsel is responsible for applying the Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by a Covered Officer will be considered by the
Independent Directors on the Board.

            The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
the Code:

            o     the Fund legal counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to such counsel;

            o     if, after such investigation, the Fund legal counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, such counsel is not required
                  to take any further action;

            o     any matter that the Fund legal counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the Board;

            o     the Board will consider appropriate action, which may include
                  review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable
                  policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
                  of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
                  dismiss the Covered Officer;

            o     the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as
                  appropriate; and

            o     any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

X.    Other Policies and Procedures

            The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are
superseded by the Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of the Code. The Fund's and its investment adviser's codes of ethics
under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and the adviser's more
detailed policies and procedures are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

XI.   Amendments

            Any amendments to the Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
independent trustees.

XII.  Confidentiality

            All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall
not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board, its legal counsel
and the adviser.
<PAGE>

XIII. Internal Use

            The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
