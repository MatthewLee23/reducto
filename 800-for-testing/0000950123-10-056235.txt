               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC,
including the schedule of investments, as of March 31, 2010, and the related
statement of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements
of changes in shareholders' capital for each of the years in the two-year period
then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years in the five-year
period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of March 31, 2010, by correspondence with underlying fund
operators, the custodian and other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC as of
March 31, 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, the changes in its shareholders' capital for each of the years
in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

     The above ratios may vary for individual investors based on the timing of

*    Per share data for income (loss) from investment operations is computed
     using the total of monthly income and expense divided by beginning of month
     shares.

**   The ratios of total expenses and net investment loss to average members'
     capital does not include the impact of expenses and incentive allocations
     or incentive fees related to the underlying Investment Funds or the impact
     of any placement fees paid by the Company.

***  As noted in Note 9 of the accompanying notes, the ratios above include
     subscription and redemption fees of $328,672. Had the Fund not incurred
     these fees, the ratio of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of
     net investment loss to average net assets would have been 1.99% and
     (1.98%), respectively. Furthermore, for the prior years ended March 31,
     2009 and 2008, the Company incurred redemption fees of $2,199,068 and
     $2,151,669, respectively. Had the Fund not incurred these fees, the ratio
     of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of net investment loss to
     average net assets would have been 2.30% and (2.29%) for the year end March
     31, 2009 and 2.40% and (2.37)% for the year ended March 31, 2008,
     respectively. There were no subscription or redemption fees for the years
     ended March 31, 2007 or 2006.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2010

1.   ORGANIZATION

     Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
     (the "Company") was organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company on
     August 16, 2002. The Company is registered under the Investment Company Act
     of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended, as a closed-end, non-diversified
     management investment company. The Company is also registered under the
     Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").

     The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital appreciation
     principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment Funds")
     managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
     employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
     strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
     short-side positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across
     the global markets, often referred to as "alternative" strategies. Because
     Investment Funds following alternative investment strategies are often
     described as hedge funds, the investment program of the Company can be
     described as a fund of hedge funds.

     Shares of the Company ("Shares") are sold to eligible investors (referred
     to as "Shareholders"). The minimum initial investment in the Company from
     each Shareholder is $25,000; the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

     Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC ("CAI" or the "Adviser"), a Delaware
     limited liability company and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
     Citigroup Inc., serves as the Company's investment adviser. The Adviser is
     registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of
     1940, as amended, and, among other things, is responsible for the
     allocation of the Company's assets to various Investment Funds. Under the
     Company's governing documents, the Company has delegated substantially all
     authority to oversee the management of the operations and assets of the
     Company to the Board of Directors.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and
     are expressed in United States dollars. The following is a summary of
     significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the
     financial statements.

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms of the respective
     limited partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements,
     offering memoranda and such negotiated "side letter" or similar
     arrangements as the Adviser may have entered into with the Investment Fund
     on behalf of the Company. The Company's investments in Investment Funds are
     carried at fair value as determined by the Company's pro-rata interest in
     the net assets of each Investment Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2010 (CONTINUED)

     All valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
     Fund and are net of management and performance incentive fees or other
     allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the
     Investment Funds' agreements. Each Investment Manager to which the Adviser
     allocates assets will charge the Company, as an investor in an underlying
     Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment
     Managers will receive performance-based compensation in the form of an
     incentive fee. The asset-based fees of the Investment Managers are
     generally expected to range from 1% to 4% annually of the net assets under
     their management and the incentive fee is generally expected to range from
     15% to 25% of net profits annually. These management and incentive fees are
     accounted for in the valuations of the Investment Funds and are not
     included in the management fees reflected in the Statement of Operations.

     The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate certain
     investments within those Investment Funds, typically those that are
     especially illiquid and/or hard to value, as "special situation" (often
     called "Side-Pocket") investments with additional redemption limitations.
     Such a Side-Pocket is, in effect, similar to a private equity fund that
     requires its investors to remain invested for the duration of the fund and
     distributes returns on the investment only when liquid assets are generated
     within the fund, typically through the sale of the fund's illiquid assets
     in exchange for cash.

     As a general matter, the fair value of the Company's investment in an
     Investment Fund represents the amount that the Company can reasonably
     expect to receive if the Company's investment was sold in an orderly
     transaction at the time of valuation. The Investment Funds provide for
     periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds
     generally require advance notice of a shareholder's intent to redeem its
     interest, and may, depending on the Investment Funds' governing agreements,
     deny or delay a redemption request. The Company considers if a liquidity
     discount on any Investment Fund should be taken due to redemption
     restrictions or suspensions by the Investment Fund. However, the effects of
     any discounts related to redemption restrictions or lock-up periods were
     determined by the Adviser to be insignificant at March 31, 2010, and
     therefore, no discounts were applied to the fair value of the Investment
     Funds. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for
     at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.
     The Investment Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
     securities and other investments that are illiquid.

     B.   NET ASSET VALUE DETERMINATION

     The net asset value of the Company is determined as of the close of
     business at the end of each month in accordance with the valuation
     principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time
     pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

     Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value might be made
     after the valuation date which could impact the net asset value per share
     at which Shareholders purchase or sell Company Shares. The valuations
     reported by the Investment Funds, upon which the Company calculates its
     month end net asset value may be subject to adjustment subsequent to the
     valuation date, based on information which becomes available after that
     valuation date. For example, fiscal year-end net

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2010 (CONTINUED)

     asset values of an Investment Fund may be revised as a result of a year-end
     audit performed by the independent auditors of that Investment Fund. Other
     adjustments to the Company's net asset value may also occur from time to
     time, such as from the misapplication by the Company or its agents of the
     valuation policies described in the Company's valuation procedures.

     Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value, which are caused
     by adjustments to the Investment Funds values or by a misapplication of the
     Company's valuation policies, that are able to be made within 90 days of
     the valuation date(s) to which the adjustment would apply will be made
     automatically unless determined to be de minimis. Other potential
     retroactive adjustments, regardless of whether their impact increases or
     decreases the Company's net asset value, will be made only if they both (i)
     are caused by a misapplication of the Company's valuation policies and (ii)
     deemed to be material. All retroactive adjustments are reported to the
     Company's Valuation Committee and to affected shareholders.

     Effective June 30, 2009, the Company adopted a policy which permits
     revisions to the number of Shares purchased or sold by Shareholders due to
     retroactive adjustments made under the circumstances described above which
     occur within 90 days of the valuation date. Prior to June 30, 2009, that
     automatic 90-day adjustment period was not in effect and retroactive
     valuation or share adjustments were not made.

     In circumstances where a retroactive adjustment is not made under the
     circumstances described above, then Shares purchased or sold by
     Shareholders will not be adjusted. As a result, to the extent that the
     subsequent impact of the event which was not adjusted adversely affects the
     Company's net asset value, the outstanding Shares of the Company will be
     adversely affected by prior repurchases made at a net asset value per Share
     higher than the adjusted value. Conversely, any increases in net asset
     value per Share resulting from such subsequent impact will be to the
     benefit of the holders of the outstanding Shares of the Company and to the
     detriment of Shareholders who previously had their Shares repurchased at a
     net asset value per Share lower than the post-impact value. New
     Shareholders may be affected in a similar way, because the same principles
     apply to the purchase of Shares.

     C.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

     Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis as earned. Expenses are
     recognized as incurred. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains
     and losses are recorded monthly.

     The change in an Investment Fund's net asset value is included in net
     change in unrealized appreciation on investments in Investment Funds on the
     Statement of Operations. The Company records a realized gain or loss on its
     investment in Investment Funds only to the extent that the cost of such
     investment as well as any Side Pocket has been fully recovered through
     previous redemptions from investment in Investment Funds.

     The Company bears all expenses incurred in the course of its operations,
     including, but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses
     related to portfolio transactions and positions for the

     Company's account; professional fees; costs of insurance; registration
     expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board of Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company became a corporation that is taxed as a regulated investment
     company as of October 1, 2005. The Company operated as a partnership from
     inception through September 30, 2005.

     It is the Company's intention to meet the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies ("RICs") and
     distribute substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
     capital gains, if any, to Shareholders each year. Therefore, no federal
     income or excise tax provision is required for the Company's financial
     statements. While the Company intends to distribute substantially all of
     its taxable net investment income and capital gains, in the manner
     necessary to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax as described above, it
     is possible that some excise tax will be incurred. In such event, the
     Company will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not
     meet the foregoing distribution requirements.

     The Company has analyzed tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
     course of preparing the Company's tax return for all open tax years and has
     concluded, as of March 31, 2010, no provision for income tax would be
     required in the Company's financial statements. The Company's federal and
     state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the
     applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to
     examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of
     revenue.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and monies invested in
     money market deposit accounts that are accounted for at amortized cost,
     which approximates fair value. Such cash, at times, may exceed federally
     insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
     and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such
     bank deposits.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
     management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
     Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other
     parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results
     to differ materially.

     G.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     On July 1, 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification Topic
     105, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("ASC 105") (formerly known
     as Financial Accounting Standards No. 168, the FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
     CODIFICATION AND HIERARCHY OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES: A
     REPLACEMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 162), as the single source of
     authoritative U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities. ASC 105 is effective
     for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. All
     existing accounting standards documents are superseded as described in ASC
     105, and all other accounting literature not included in ASC 105 is
     nonauthoritative. ASC 105 will amend the Company's disclosure for
     references to accounting guidance to include reference to the applicable
     section of ASC 105.

     In September 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
     2009-12 ("ASU 2009-12"), INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT CALCULATE NET
     ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (OR ITS EQUIVALENT), which includes guidance on fair
     value measurements and disclosures relating to investments in certain
     entities that calculate net asset value ("NAV") per share (or its
     equivalent). The guidance permits, as a practical expedient, an entity
     holding investments in certain entities that calculate NAV per share or its
     equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure
     the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or
     its equivalent, without adjustment. The guidance also requires disclosure
     of the attributes of investments within the scope of the guidance by major
     category of investment. Such disclosures include the nature of any
     restrictions on an investor's ability to redeem its investments at the
     measurement date, any unfunded commitments and the investment strategies of
     the investee. The guidance permits investments to be characterized as Level
     2 investments if the entity holding the investment has the ability to
     redeem its investment with the investee at net asset value per share at the
     measurement date, on at least a quarterly basis. The guidance is effective
     for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2009. The Company
     has adopted this disclosure effective with the issuance of its March 31,
     2010 financial statements, which has caused many of the Company's
     investments to be classified as Level 2 as compared to the prior
     classification as Level 3.

     In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No 2010-06 ("ASU 2010-06"), IMPROVING
     DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, which requires new disclosures
     and provides amendments to ASC Subtopic 820-10 clarifying existing
     disclosures. The new disclosures relate to transfers in and out of Level 1
     and 2 investments, and disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
     settlements of Level 3 investments on a gross basis. The guidance also
     clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and
     disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. The disclosures
     regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 investments, and
     clarifications to existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual
     periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The disclosures regarding
     disclosures of Level 3 investment rollforward of activity on a gross basis
     are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The
     Company is currently evaluating the impact of these disclosures on its
     financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2010 (CONTINUED)

     In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09 ("ASU 2010-09"),
     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE
     REQUIREMENTS, which amends ASC Subtopic 855-10. ASU 2010-09 describes
     amendments which clarify which entities are required to evaluate subsequent
     events through the date the financial statements are issued and the scope
     of the disclosure requirements related to subsequent events, and is
     effective upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance has no material
     impact on the Company's financial statement disclosures.

3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

     In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
     and disclosures under GAAP, the Company discloses the fair value of its
     investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
     techniques used to measure the fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
     priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active
     markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the
     lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are
     significant to the valuation (level 3 measurement). The guidance
     establishes three levels of fair value as listed below.

     Level 1- Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
     identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
     at the measurement date;

     Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
     or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets
     that are not considered to be active;

     Level 3- Inputs that are unobservable.

     The notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in
     which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
     at the measurement date. Under Level 3, the owner of an asset must
     determine valuation based on its own assumptions about what market
     participants would take into account in determining the fair value of the
     asset, using the best information available.

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
     an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategies, their liquidity
     and redemption notice periods and any restrictions on the liquidity
     provisions of the investments in Portfolio Funds held in the Company as of
     March 31, 2010. Portfolio Funds with no current redemption restrictions may
     be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions, in
     accordance with their offering documents which, in accordance with ASU
     2009-12, would affect its disclosure. The Company had no unfunded capital
     commitments as of March 31, 2010.

     Directional equity funds take long and short stock positions. The manager
     may attempt to profit from both long and short stock positions
     independently, or profit from the relative outperformance of long positions
     against short positions. The stock picking and portfolio construction
     process is usually based on bottom-up fundamental stock analysis, but may
     also include top-down macro-based views, market trends and sentiment
     factors. Directional equity managers may specialize by region

     (e.g., global, U.S., Europe or Japan) or by sector. No assurance can be
     given that the managers will be able to correctly locate profitable trading
     opportunities, and such opportunities may be adversely affected by
     unforeseen events. In addition, short selling creates the risk of loss if
     the security that has been sold short appreciates in value. The Investment
     Funds within this strategy have monthly to quarterly liquidity, and are
     generally subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period. One Investment Fund in
     this strategy, representing approximately 1 percent in this strategy, is an
     illiquid side pocket investment, and has suspended redemptions. The
     remaining approximately 99 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy
     can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date, and so,
     are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Directional macro strategies require well developed risk management
     procedures due to the frequent employment of leverage. Investment managers
     may trade futures, options on future contracts and foreign exchange
     contracts and may trade in diversified markets or focus on one market
     sector. Two types of strategies employed by directional macro managers are
     DISCRETIONARY and SYSTEMATIC trading. Discretionary trading strategies seek
     to dynamically allocate capital to relatively short-term trading
     opportunities around the world. Directional strategies (seeking to
     participate in rising and declining when the trend appears strong and
     justified by fundamentals) and relative value approaches (establishing long
     positions in undervalued instruments and short positions in related
     instruments believed to be over valued) or in "spread" positions in an
     attempt to capture changes in the relationships between instruments.
     Systematic trading strategies generally rely on computerized trading
     systems or models to identify and capitalize on trends in financial and
     commodity markets. This systematic approach allows investment managers to
     seek to take advantage of price patterns in very large number of markets.
     The trading models may be focused on technical or fundamental factors or
     combination of factors. Generally, the Investment Funds within this
     strategy have monthly liquidity, subject to a 5 to 90 day notice period.
     Investment Funds in this strategy, representing approximately 1 percent,
     are illiquid side pocket investments with suspended redemptions. The
     remaining approximately 99 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy
     can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date, and so,
     are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Event driven strategies involve investing in opportunities created by
     significant transactional events such as spin-offs, mergers and
     acquisitions, bankruptcies, recapitalizations and share buybacks. Event
     driven strategies include "merger arbitrage" and "distressed securities".
     Generally, the Investment Funds within this strategy have monthly to annual
     liquidity, subject to a 30 to 180 day notice period. Investment Funds in
     this strategy, representing approximately 16 percent, are illiquid side
     pocket investments with suspended redemptions. In addition, approximately
     17 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy have gated redemptions,
     which are expected to be lifted within 12 months. The remaining
     approximately 67 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy can be
     redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are
     classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Relative value arbitrage strategies seek to take advantage of specific
     pricing anomalies, while also seeking to maintain minimal exposure to
     systematic market risk. This may be achieved by purchasing one security
     previously believed to be undervalued, while selling short another security


                                      -15-

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2010 (CONTINUED)

     perceived to be overvalued. Relative value arbitrage strategies include
     equity market neutral, statistical arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and
     fixed income arbitrage. Some investment managers classified as
     multi-strategy relative value arbitrage use a combination of these
     substrategies. Generally, the Investment Funds within this strategy have
     monthly to quarterly liquidity, subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period.
     Investment Funds in this strategy, representing approximately 4 percent,
     are illiquid side pocket investments with suspended redemptions. The
     remaining approximately 96 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy
     can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date, and so,
     are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     The Company follows the authoritative guidance under GAAP on determining
     fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability
     have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not
     orderly. Accordingly, if the Company determines that either the volume
     and/or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly
     decreased (from normal conditions for that asset or liability) or price
     quotations or observable inputs are not associated with orderly
     transactions, increased analysis and management judgment will be required
     to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques such as an income approach
     might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market approach in those
     circumstances.

     The guidance also provides a list of factors to determine whether there has
     been a significant decrease in relation to normal market activity.
     Regardless, however, of the valuation technique and inputs used, the
     objective for the fair value measurement in those circumstances is
     unchanged from what it would be if markets were operating at normal
     activity levels and/or transactions were orderly; that is, to determine the
     current exit price.

     A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based
     upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value
     measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes "observable"
     requires significant judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser considers
     observable data to be market data which is readily available, regularly
     distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and
     provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant
     market.

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
     an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

     The following is a summary of the inputs used as of March 31, 2010, in
     valuing the Company's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

     of the Company's Shares. A placement agent will generally be entitled to
     receive a fee from each investor in the Company whose Shares the agent
     places. The specific amount of the placement fee paid with respect to a
     Shareholder is generally dependent on the size of the investment in the
     Company.

     owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. serves as a placement agent of the

6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

     Generally, initial and additional subscriptions for Shares may be accepted
     as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by the Board of
     Directors of the Company to accept or reject any initial and additional
     subscriptions for Shares in the Company. The Board of Directors from time
     to time and in its complete and exclusive discretion, may determine to
     cause the Company to repurchase Shares from Shareholders pursuant to
     written tenders by Shareholders on such terms and conditions as it may
     determine. CAI expects that it typically will recommend to the Board of
     Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders
     quarterly, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or, if
     any such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business
     day).

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts and
     entering into equity swaps. The Company's risk of loss in these Investment
     Funds is limited to the value of it's investment in the respective
     Investment Funds.

8.   INCOME TAXES

     The tax basis of distributable earnings shown in the table below represent
     distribution requirements the Company must satisfy under the income tax
     regulations, losses the Company may be able to offset against income and
     gains realized in future years and unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     of securities and other investments for federal income tax purposes.

     distributions from Investment Funds and the tax realization of financial
     statement unrealized gain or loss. In addition, the cost of Investment
     Funds for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of taxable
     income allocated the Company from the Investment Funds. The allocated
     taxable income is reported to the Company by each Investment Fund on
     Schedule K-1. The aggregate cost on Investment Funds for federal income tax
     purposes is therefore calculated and presented annually as of March 31. The
     aggregate cost on Investment Funds and the composition of unrealized
     appreciation and depreciation on Investment Funds for federal income tax
     purposes is noted below.

</TABLE>

     Net investment income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) differ for
     financial statement and tax purposes. The character of dividends and
     distributions made during the fiscal year from net investment income or net
     realized gains differ from their ultimate characterization for federal
     income tax purposes. Also, due to timing of dividends and distributions,
     the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed differ from the fiscal
     year in which the income or net realized gain was recorded by the Company.

     Accordingly, the following amounts have been reclassified for March 31,
     2010, and are primarily due to the different book to tax treatment for the
     distributive share of partnership items and different book to tax treatment
     for gains realized on the sale of Investment Funds classified as passive
     foreign investment companies.

     Net assets of the Company were unaffected by the reclassifications.

</TABLE>

     For the year ended March 31, 2010, the tax character of distributions paid
     by the Company was $85,488,824 ordinary income. For the year ended March
     31, 2009, the tax character of distributions paid by the Company was
     $6,403,370 ordinary income and $11,058,400 of long term capital gains.
     Distributions from net investment income and short-term capital gains are
     treated as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.

     As of March 31, 2010, the Company has a capital loss carryforward of
     $54,139,447, which is available to offset future capital gains. If not
     utilized against capital gains, this capital loss carryforward will expire
     on March 31, 2018.

     losses of $2,061,929 incurred between November 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010
     as being incurred during the tax year ending on March 31, 2011. These
     losses are available to offset future capital gains, if any.

9.   REDEMPTION PENALTY

     During the year ended March 31, 2010, the Company paid redemption penalties
     totaling $328,672. The redemption penalties were charged to the Company for
     redeeming its interests of certain Investment Funds prior to the expiration
     of applicable lock-up periods. The payment of these penalties released the
     Company from any further liability for its investments in the applicable
     Investment Funds and is recorded as an operating expense in the Statement
     of Operations.

10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On April 14, 2010, a transaction was announced in which SkyBridge Capital
     ("SkyBridge") will acquire certain businesses of Citigroup Alternative
     Investments LLC, the Company's investment adviser. SkyBridge is a global
     alternative investment firm registered as an investment adviser with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission and having approximately $1.4 billion
     under management.

     Mr. Raymond Nolte, currently CEO of Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC's

     Investment Officer. All investment professionals of the Adviser that
     currently have significant involvement in the Company's operations are
     expected to join SkyBridge as well.

     On May 4th, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors met to consider the
     planned transition of the Company's investment advisory services and
     determined that concurrent with the consummation of the transaction, the
     appointment of SkyBridge as the Company's investment adviser is in the best
     interests of the Company and its shareholders. In accordance with
     applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, a special meeting of
     shareholders will be scheduled and proxy materials will be distributed for
     shareholders to vote on a new advisory contract with SkyBridge. Management
     has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Company through
     the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that
     there were no additional subsequent events requiring recognition or
     disclosure in the financial statements.

In addition to their roles as Independent Directors of the Company, each of
Steven Krull and Josh Weinreich serve on special independent committees
representing other clients of the Adviser. The committee engagements and related
compensation are described below. These matters have been reviewed by the
Company's Board of Directors, which determined that the engagements are
appropriate for Independent Directors of the Company.

Mr. Krull serves on the Advisory Committee for the Adviser's HedgeForum
business. HedgeForum is a program under which third-party private investment
funds are diligenced by the Adviser and then made available for direct
investment by sophisticated investors. Mr. Krull is one of three members of the
HedgeForum Advisory Committee (all committee members are unaffiliated with the
Adviser) and receives for his services an annual retainer of $12,000 plus
certain meeting fees and reimbursements for out of pocket expenses. For the year
ended March 31, 2009, Mr. Krull received $12,000 in connection with this
engagement. All such costs are borne by the third-party investment funds
participating in the HedgeForum offering.

Mr. Weinreich serves on the Conflicts Committee for the Adviser. That committee
is charged primarily with reviewing conflict-of-interest transactions initiated

</TABLE>

        POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

        As shown in the table above, Mr. Nolte is responsible for managing other
        accounts  ("Other  Accounts")  in  addition  to  the  Fund.  In  certain
        instances,  conflicts  may arise in his  management of the Fund and such
        other Accounts.

        One  situation  where a conflict may arise between the Fund and an Other
        Account is in the allocation of investment  opportunities among the Fund
        and the Other Account. For example, the Adviser may determine that there
        is an  opportunity  that is  suitable  for the Fund as well as for Other
        Accounts of the Adviser, which have a similar investment objective. As a
        related matter, a particular  Investment Fund interest or other security
        may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are
        selling that same  security,  which may adversely  affect the Fund.  The
        Company and the Adviser have adopted  policies and procedures  regarding
        the allocation of investment opportunities, which generally require that
        investment  opportunities be allocated among the Fund and Other Accounts
        in a manner that is fair,  equitable and consistent with their fiduciary
        obligations to each.

        Mr. Nolte's  management of the Fund and Other Accounts may result in his
        devoting  a  disproportionate  amount  of  time  and  attention  to  the
        management of a particular account as against another. This particularly
        may be the case when accounts  have  different  objectives,  benchmarks,
        time horizons, asset levels and fees.
<PAGE>

        The  management  of  personal  accounts  by Mr.  Nolte  may give rise to
        potential conflicts of interest. While the Adviser's code of ethics will
        impose  limits on the  ability  of Mr.  Nolte to trade for his  personal
        account,  there is no assurance  that the Adviser's  code of ethics will
        eliminate such conflicts.

        Other than the conflicts  described  above,  the Company is not aware of
        any material  conflicts that may arise in connection  with the Adviser's
        management of the Fund's investments and such Other Accounts.

(A)(3)  COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE  OF  PORTFOLIO  MANAGER(S)  OR  MANAGEMENT  TEAM
        MEMBERS -- AS OF MARCH 31, 2010

        Mr.  Nolte's  compensation  is a  combination  of salary,  discretionary
        bonus,   deferred   compensation,   retirement   plans   and   automatic
        participation in a company-funded  retirement  bonus. The  discretionary
        bonus is based upon the financial results and profitability of Citigroup
        as a whole,  that of CAI as a whole,  and that of CAI's  Global  Fund of
        Funds business unit, for which Mr. Nolte serves as chief executive.  The
        discretionary  bonus is not linked to the  performance  of any  specific
        benchmark  or that  of any  CAI  investment  fund  or  account;  nor are
        specific asset size targets considered.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



I.       COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics  (the  "Code")  for the Fund  applies  to its Chief
         Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or
         persons  performing similar functions) (as of August 2005, Ray Nolte as
         President  and as of  December  2006 Amy Olsen as  Treasurer;  each,  a
         "Covered Officer") for the purpose of promoting:

         o      honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical  handling of
                actual or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and
                professional relationships.

         o      full, fair,  accurate,  timely and understandable  disclosure in
                reports and documents  that a company files with, or submits to,
                the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other
                public communications made by the Fund;

         o      compliance  with  applicable  laws and  governmental  rules  and
                regulations;

         o      prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of the  Code  to an
                appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o      accountability for adherence to the Code.

                Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere  to a  high  standard  of
business  ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to
actual  as well as  apparent  conflicts  of  interest.  Any  question  about the
application  of the Code should be referred  to the Fund's  Chief Legal  Officer
(initially Millie Kim, General Counsel of the Fund's investment adviser).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND  APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private interest interferes,  or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his or her service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise
if a  Covered  Officer,  or a


                                       1
<PAGE>
member of his or her family,  receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his or her position with the Fund.(1)

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its  investment  adviser's  compliance  programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures,  and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code,  unless or until the Chief Legal Officer  determines any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and its  investment  adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that
the  Covered  Officers  will,  in the  normal  course of their  duties  (whether
formally  for  the  Fund  or for the  adviser,  or for  both),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
the Fund and the adviser and is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered
Officers  of their  duties  as  officers  of the Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition,  it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors  ("Board") that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other  conflicts  of  interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the  Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the
personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly  before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:


- -------------------------------
(1) Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family relationships,
each  Covered  Officer  should   consider  such  potential   conflicts  and,  if
appropriate,  familiarize  his or her family members with the Covered  Officer's
relevant obligations under this Code.

                                       2
<PAGE>


          o      use his or her  personal  influence  or personal  relationships
                 improperly  to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial
                 reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
                 personally  (directly or  indirectly)  to the  detriment of the
                 Fund;

          o      cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,  for the
                 (direct or indirect) individual personal benefit of the Covered
                 Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; or

          o      use material  non-public  knowledge  of portfolio  transactions
                 made or contemplated  for the Fund to trade personally or cause
                 others  to trade  personally  in  contemplation  of the  market
                 effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
affiliations  and significant  business  interests  outside the Citigroup,  Inc.
corporate group and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest  situations should always be approved by the Chief
Legal Officer and, if material,  be communicated to the relevant Fund's Board of
Directors. Examples of these include:

          o      service as a director on the board of any company;

          o      accepting directly or indirectly,  anything of value, including
                 gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person
                 or  entity  with  which  the Fund has  current  or  prospective
                 business dealings, not including occasional meals or tickets to
                 theatre  or  sporting  events or other  similar  entertainment,
                 provided   it  is   business-related,   reasonable   in   cost,
                 appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent  as to
                 raise any question of impropriety.

          o      any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or  employment
                 relationship with, any of the Fund's service  providers,  other
                 than    its    investment    adviser,    principal    placement
                 agent/underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof;

          o      a  direct  or  indirect   financial  interest  in  commissions,
                 transaction  charges or spreads paid by the Fund for  effecting
                 portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
                 than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment,
                 such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

          o      Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with
                 the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;



                                       3
<PAGE>

          o      each Covered  Officer  should not  knowingly  misrepresent,  or
                 cause others to  misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others,
                 whether  within or outside  the Fund,  including  to the Fund's
                 Directors  and auditors,  and to  governmental  regulators  and
                 self-regulatory organizations;

          o      each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate  within
                 his or her area of responsibility,  consult with other officers
                 and  employees  of the  Fund and its  adviser  with the goal of
                 promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,  timely  and  understandable
                 disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or
                 submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications made by
                 the Fund; and

          o      it is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to  use
                 reasonable efforts to promote compliance with the standards and
                 restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o      upon  adoption  of the Code  (thereafter  as  applicable,  upon
                 becoming  a Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing to the Board
                 that he or she has received, read and understands the Code;

          o      annually  thereafter  affirm  to the  Board  that he or she has
                 complied with the requirements of the Code;

          o      not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee
                 of the Fund or its affiliated  persons for reports of potential
                 violations that are made in good faith; and

          o      notify the Chief Legal  Officer  promptly if he or she knows of
                 any  violation  of this  Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself  a
                 violation of this Code.

         The Chief  Legal  Officer  is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations  in  which  questions  are  presented  under it and has the
authority to  interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any
explicit or implicit  waivers(2)  sought by a Covered Officer must be considered
by the Audit Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

         The Fund will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:



- ----------------------
(2) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material  departure  form a  provision  of the code of ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a reasonable period
of time  regarding a material  departure  from a provision of the code of ethics
that has been made known to an executive officer" of the registrant.


                                       4
<PAGE>


          o      the  Chief  Legal  Officer  will  take  appropriate  action  to
                 investigate any potential violations reported to him or her;

          o      if, after such investigation,  the Chief Legal Officer believes
                 that no violation has occurred,  the Chief Legal Officer is not
                 required  to take any  further  action,  but will meet with the
                 person  reporting  the  violation  for the purpose of informing
                 such person of the reason for not taking action;

          o      any matter that the Chief Legal Officer believes is a violation
                 will be reported to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board;

          o      if the Audit  Committee  concurs that a violation has occurred,
                 they will consider appropriate action, which may include review
                 of, and appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and
                 procedures;   notification  to  appropriate  personnel  of  the
                 investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss
                 the Covered Officer as an officer of the Fund;

          o      the Audit Committee will be responsible  for granting  waivers,
                 as  appropriate,  provided that waivers will be considered only
                 if  supported  by a written  request on behalf of the  relevant
                 Covered  Officer  explaining the basis for such request and how
                 the waiver may be  implemented  consistent  with the principles
                 underlying this Code; and

          o      any  changes to or  waivers  of this Code  will,  to the extent
                 required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

         The Audit Committee,  in determining  whether waivers should be granted
or whether violations have occurred,  and the Chief Legal Officer,  in rendering
decisions  and  interpretations  and in conducting  investigations  of potential
violations  under the Code,  may, at their  discretion,  consult with such other
persons as they  determine  to be  appropriate,  including,  but not limited to,
another  senior  legal  officer  of the Fund or its  investment  adviser  or its
affiliates,  counsel to the Fund or its  investment  adviser or such  affiliate,
counsel to the  Independent  Directors,  or (subject to applicable  pre-approval
requirements) independent auditors or other consultants



V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund,  the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
placement  agent/underwriter,  or other service  providers  govern or purport to
govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to
this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or
conflict  with the  provisions  of this Code,  unless any provision of this Code
conflicts  with  any  applicable  federal  or  state  law,  in  which  case



                                       5
<PAGE>
the  requirements  of such  law  will  govern.  The  Fund's  and its  investment
adviser's  and  principal  placement  agent/underwriter's  codes of ethics under
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act are separate  requirements that may apply
to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any  amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority
vote of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code
will  be  considered   confidential   and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent  Directors and their
counsel,  the Fund and its  counsel and the  investment  adviser and its counsel
(and,  as relevant,  any other  person  described  in the last  paragraph  under
"Reporting and Accountability" above).



                                       6
<PAGE>

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of the  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I  have  read  and   understand   the  terms  of  the  Code.  I  recognize   the
responsibilities  and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.
