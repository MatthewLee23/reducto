ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

        The Semi-Annual Report to Stockholders follows.

<PAGE>

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

   Performance Review: On a long-term basis, as of June 30, 2004, your Fund had
a three-year cumulative total return of 23.5%. In comparison, the S&P Utilities
Index had a total return of -27.1%, while a composite of the S&P Utilities
Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index, reflecting the stock and bond ratio of
the Fund, had a total return of -18.2%.

   On a shorter-term basis, your Fund had a total return of -5.9% for the
quarter ended June 30, 2004. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a total
return of 1.3%. A composite of the S&P Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility
Bond Index had a total return of -1.9%. Year-to-date your Fund had a total
return of -0.3%. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a total return of
3.8%. A composite of the S&P Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index
had a total return of 2.7%.

   During the second quarter of 2004, your Fund paid three monthly 6.5 cents
per share dividends. The 6.5 cents per share monthly rate, without compounding,
would be 78 cents annualized, or a 7.41% common stock dividend yield based on
the June 30, 2004, closing price of $10.52. This compares favorably with the
quarter-end yields of 3.58% on the Dow Jones Utility Index and 3.80% on the S&P
Utilities Index.

   Background and Implications of Changes in the Fed's Monetary Policy: In
recent years, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy has been "accommodative",
meaning that it has been designed to stimulate economic growth by lowering
short term interest rates, making money less expensive to borrow. In May 2004,
however, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that in
order to curb inflationary tendencies it intends to start removing its
accommodative stance "at a pace that is likely to be measured." What caused the
Fed to change its policy, what can investors expect over the coming months from
the Federal Reserve, and what are the implications for your Fund?

   The Federal Reserve's stated goal is fostering sustainable noninflationary
growth. Economic growth reported thus far in 2004, especially gross domestic
product (GDP), has been strong. Through the second quarter of 2004,
year-over-year inflation-adjusted GDP expanded by 4.8%, compared to 4.4% for
calendar year 2003, and 2.3% for 2002. The average rate of growth for the last
15 calendar years has been 3.0%. In addition to GDP, there is a second key
measure of economic health--gains in employment--which has also begun to show
strength in 2004. In his July congressional testimony, Fed Chairman Greenspan
noted that gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 200,000 per month
for the last six months, up sharply from the 60,000 average for the last
quarter of 2003. During the last 15 years, nonfarm job creation has averaged
approximately 130,000 per month for all periods and about 200,000 a month in
expansionary periods. Job creation has been an important factor in bringing the
unemployment rate down from 6.3% in June 2003 to 5.5% in July 2004, a trend the
Fed would like to see continue. From the Fed's perspective, the expanding rate
of growth in both GDP and employment indicates that the stimulus provided in
the recent past should be sufficient to sustain economic momentum and that it
may be time to scale back the Fed's accommodative stance.

   The Fed is now concerned that economic growth can lead to inflation if
demand for goods and services exceeds the economy's capacity to supply them.
Recognizing that the improvement in the labor market will likely increase
household income and eventually result in higher levels of consumption, the Fed
is closely watching measures of the economy's ability to increase production
without creating inflationary pressures. One important measure is capacity
utilization, which now stands at 77.2%, higher than the previous figure but
still below the 82.1% level that existed when the Fed last became less
accommodative. The fact remains, however, that inflation has increased
somewhat. Depending on which measure is chosen, much of the recent increase in

<PAGE>

inflation is related to the surge in energy prices. Because energy prices can
be volatile, many economists believe some measures are better indicators of
long-term inflation trends than others. Chairman Greenspan prefers the core
personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE). This index measures the
rate of price increase based on how consumers actually spend their money
exclusive of volatile food and energy items. The twelve-month change in the
core PCE was 1.1% at the end of last year and was reported to be 1.5% in June
of this year.

   Although the increase of core PCE inflation is important, the level of
increase is moderate. Also, it must be remembered that within the last twelve
months the Fed was concerned about the possibility of deflation brought on by
the economic impacts of the bear stock market and corporate scandals of
2000-2002; the capital goods expenditure contraction related to the falling
stock market and the completion of year 2000 (Y2K) technology upgrades; and the
terrorist attacks and war in Iraq. Nonetheless, the FOMC responded in May to
the changing balance between demonstrated economic growth and uncertainties
related to inflationary/deflationary pressures by deciding to remove monetary
accommodation in a measured way.

   Investors got their first measures of restraint on June 30 and August 10,
2004, when the Fed raised the federal funds rate in two 25 basis point
increments to 1.50%. If the Fed desires to return interest rates to a more
neutral level, we can expect more increases in the period ahead, although how
much is unknown. Some economists note that historically the real federal funds
rate, the funds rate minus inflation, has averaged around 2.5%. Other
economists favor the Taylor Rule which relies on central tendency forecasts of
GDP and inflation. Yields on longer maturity Treasury notes and bonds also give
a market expectation of the future path of interest rates. These and other
methodologies forecast federal funds with a very wide range of 2.00% to 4.50%
over the next 12 months.

   As a practical matter, it is the future course of unknown developments in
economic growth and inflation, and the Federal Reserve's response to them, that
will determine how high interest rates go. A case in point is the just released
July payroll number which was so weak that some market participants have called
into question the Fed's ability to pursue a measured tightening policy. Our
favored scenario is moderate and recognizes the crosscurrents in the economic
outlook. We think the funds rate will be moved to 2.00% over the remainder of
this year, and then the Fed will pause to determine the economic reaction.
Subsequently, if additional increases are required, rates will be managed
higher, but if the economy weakens, there will be room once again to move rates
lower.

   Investor perception historically has been that utility share prices can
react to changes in interest rates. Over long periods, utility share prices
have actually exhibited a relatively low correlation to interest rates, but
over shorter periods factors affected by the level of interest rates can play a
role. During periods of rapid capacity growth, like the nuclear power plant
construction of the 1970's and 1980's, or the venture into unregulated
businesses most recently seen in the late 1990's, utilities have funded
projects with debt, increasing their interest costs. Currently, the utility
industries--electric, gas, and telecommunications--are implementing
back-to-basics strategies, including a return to core competencies, improved
balance sheets, less debt, and more cash being returned to shareholders.

   During periods of generally high interest rates, the yields on other asset
types can rise high enough to present an attractive risk adjusted alternative
to utility stocks for some investors. Utilities and REITs are the highest
yielding sectors of the stock market, and the bulwark of your Fund. Your Fund
managers believe that

                                      2

<PAGE>

choosing investments based on company management's ability to maintain and grow
earnings and dividends is the best way to meet the Fund's current income
objective and protect shareholder value.

   Closed-end mutual funds, including your Fund, benefit from the use of
leverage--the ability to borrow money at relatively low short-term interest
rates and invest in longer-term and higher yielding securities. Leverage
therefore facilitates higher shareholder dividends. The future course of short
and long-term interest rates will determine the level of advantage the Fund is
able to derive from that strategy. During every period of Fed tightening since
the 1970's, long-term rates have risen whenever the Fed has raised short-term
rates. We anticipate that over the coming months all rates will rise, providing
first a hurdle and than an opportunity to invest at higher yields.

   Board of Directors Meeting: At the regular July 2004 Board of Directors'
meeting, the Board declared the following monthly dividends:

<TABLE>

                   Cents Per Share Record Date  Payable Date
                   --------------- ------------ ------------
                   <S>             <C>          <C>
                         6.5...... August 31    September 10
                         6.5...... September 30 October 12
                         6.5...... October 29   November 10
</TABLE>

   The determination of the character of all Fund distributions (specifying
which portion is ordinary income, qualifying dividend income, short or long
term capital gains, or return of capital) is made each year-end and is reported
to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed every year in late January.

   At the February 2004 Board Meeting, the Board reviewed the Fund's dividend
policy and reaffirmed the current 6.5 cents per share per month distribution
rate. Interest rates are at or near 40-year lows and utility common stock
dividends are well below their long-term average. Therefore, in 2004, the Fund
has made increased use of realized gains to supplement its investment income
and has reduced its use of short-term trading strategies designed to capture
dividend income. Until the Fund utilizes all of its tax loss carryforwards,
distributions to shareholders derived from realized gains will be treated as
ordinary income for tax purposes. In addition, the reduced use of short-term
trading strategies by the Fund will lower the Fund's portfolio turnover rate
and transaction costs and, after the Fund utilizes all of its tax loss
carryforwards, will potentially increase the portion of the Fund's
distributions to shareholders that will be taxable at the lower income tax rate
applicable to qualifying dividends. In the future, in order to maintain the
Fund's dividend rate, in the absence of increases in the yields available on
Fund investments and/or realizable gains on Fund investments, the Fund's
dividend distributions may include a portion of non-taxable return of capital.

   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Direct Deposit Service--The Fund
has a dividend reinvestment plan available as a benefit to all registered
shareholders. As long as the market price of the common stock of the Fund
exceeds or is equal to the net asset value per share, new shares for the
dividend reinvestment program are issued at the greater of either 95% of the
market price or net asset value. If the market price per share of common stock
is below the net asset value per share, shares are purchased in the open market
at prevailing market prices, plus any brokerage commissions paid by The Bank of
New York.

   Those shareholders whose shares are held for them by a brokerage house or
nominee in "street-name" may not participate in the Fund's automatic dividend
reinvestment plan. For such shareholders desiring automatic dividend
reinvestment, we suggest you contact your broker or other nominee.

                                      3

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)
                                 June 30, 2004

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   DNP SELECT INCOME FUND INC. (the "Fund") was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Maryland on November 26, 1986. The Fund commenced operations on
January 21, 1987, as a closed-end diversified management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The primary investment
objectives of the Fund are current income and long-term growth of income.
Capital appreciation is a secondary objective.

   The following are the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

      (a) The market values for securities are determined as follows: Equity
   securities traded on a national securities exchange or traded
   over-the-counter and quoted on the NASDAQ System are valued at last sales
   prices. Fixed income securities and any other securities for which it is
   determined that market prices are unavailable or inappropriate are valued at
   a fair value using a procedure determined in good faith by the Board of
   Directors which includes the use of a pricing service. Each money market
   instrument having a maturity of 60 days or less is valued on an amortized
   cost basis, which approximates market value.

      (b) Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury, U.S.
   Government Agency and other investment grade securities. All collateral is
   held by an independent third-party custodian bank on behalf of the Fund
   until maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the agreement
   provide that the market value of the collateral plus accrued interest on the
   collateral is greater than or equal to the repurchase price plus accrued
   interest at all times. In the event of a default or bankruptcy by the other
   party to the agreements, the Fund maintains the right to sell the underlying
   collateral securities at market value; however realization and/or retention
   of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

      (c) No provision is made for Federal income taxes since the Fund has
   elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" and has made such
   distributions to its shareholders deemed necessary to be relieved of all
   Federal income taxes under provisions of current Federal tax law. The Fund
   intends to utilize provisions of Federal income tax laws which allow a
   realized capital loss to be carried forward for eight years following the
   year of loss and offset such losses against any future realized gains. At
   December 31, 2003, the Fund had tax capital loss carry forwards of
   $387,291,560 of which $49,518,674 will expire in 2007; $126,699,370 will
   expire in 2010 and $211,073,516 will expire in 2011.

      At December 31, 2003, on a tax basis, the Fund had undistributed net
   investment income of $6,008,643; and based on a $2,712,873,413 tax cost of
   investments, gross unrealized appreciation of $253,248,708 and unrealized
   depreciation of $92,979,901. The difference between the book basis and tax
   basis of distributable earnings are primarily a result of tax deferral of
   wash sale losses, the accretion of market discount and amortization of
   premiums.

      (d) Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains
   or losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific identified
   cost basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest
   income and expense are recognized on the accrual basis. Discounts and
   premiums on securities are amortized over the lives of the respective
   securities for book purposes. Discounts and premiums are not amortized for
   tax purposes.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
                                  (UNAUDITED)
                                 June 30, 2004


      (e) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
   liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
   of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
   decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
   results could differ from those estimates.

(2) MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS:

   The Fund has engaged Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (the "Adviser")
to provide professional investment management services for the Fund and has
engaged J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons, Inc. (the "Administrator") to provide
administrative and management services for the Fund. The Adviser receives a
quarterly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the average weekly net assets of the
Fund up to $1.5 billion and .50% of average weekly net assets in excess
thereof. The Administrator receives a quarterly fee at annual rates of .25% of
average weekly net assets up to $100 million, .20% of average weekly net assets
from $100 million to $1 billion, and .10% of average weekly net assets over $1
billion. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, "average weekly net
assets" is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate net asset value of the
Fund's common stock (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Fund's
preferred stock and (iii) the aggregate proceeds to the Fund of commercial
paper issued by the Fund. Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Adviser
receive a fee of $25,000 per year plus $2,000 per board meeting, plus $1,500
per committee meeting attended. Committee Chairmen receive an additional fee of
$5,000 per year. Total fees paid to directors for the six months ended June 30,
2004 were $205,977.

(3) DIVIDENDS:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the following distributions to common
stockholders from investment income in 2004:

             Record  Payable  Dividend   Record  Payable  Dividend
              Date    Date    Per Share   Date    Date    Per Share

            03-31-04 04-12-04    .065   06-30-04 07-12-04    .065
</TABLE>

   The tax basis for all distributions is determined after year end and may
include qualifying and non-qualifying ordinary income, short or long term
capital gains or return of capital.

(4) CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS:

   The Fund may purchase shares of its own stock in open market or private
transactions, from time to time and in such amounts and at such prices (not
exceeding $100,000 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends in the case of the
Fund's remarketed preferred stock and less than net asset value in the case of
the Fund's common stock) as management may deem advisable. Since any such
purchases of the Fund's common stock would be made at prices below net asset
value, they would increase the net asset value per share of the remaining
shares of common stock outstanding. The Fund has not purchased any shares of
its common stock.

(5) REMARKETED PREFERRED STOCK:

   In 1988, the Fund issued 5,000 shares of Remarketed Preferred Stock ("RP")
in five series of 1,000 shares each at a public offering price of $100,000 per
share. The underwriting discount and other expenses incurred in connection with
the issuance of the RP were recorded as a reduction of paid-in surplus on
common stock. Dividends on the RP are cumulative at a rate which was initially
established for each series at its offering. Since the initial offering of each
series, the dividend rate on each series has been reset every 49 days by a
remarketing process. Dividend rates ranged from 1.04% to 1.65% during the six
months ended June 30, 2004.

   The RP is redeemable at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the RP, and the RP is subject to mandatory redemption if that asset coverage
is not maintained. Each series of RP is also subject to mandatory redemption on
a date certain as follows: Series A--November 28, 2012; Series B--November 18,
2015; Series C--November 7, 2018; Series D--December 22, 2021; and Series
E--December 11, 2024.

   In general, the holders of the RP and of the Common Stock have equal voting
rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the RP, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Directors, and separate class votes
are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the RP
and the Common Stock. The RP has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(6) COMMERCIAL PAPER:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the Fund to issue up to $200,000,000
of Commercial Paper Notes (the "Notes") in minimum denominations of $100,000
with maturities up to 270 days. The Notes generally will be sold on a discount
basis, but may be sold on an interest-bearing basis. The Notes are not
redeemable by the Fund nor are they subject to voluntary prepayment prior to
maturity. The aggregate amount of Notes outstanding
changes from time to time. The Notes are unsecured, general obligations of the
Fund. The Fund has entered into

securities. Security loans are subject to the risk of failure by the borrower

*  Annualized
(1)Upon the adoption of FAS 150 in 2003, dividends on preferred stock are
   included in interest expense and are part of net investment income. Absent
   this change in accounting, per share net investment income and dividends on
   preferred stock would have been $.30 and $.02, respectively for the six
   months ended June 30, 2004 and $.78 and $.03, respectively in 2003. The
   ratios of expenses and net investment income to average net assets
   applicable to common stock would have been 1.44% and 6.11%, annualized,
   respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 1.51% and 10.25%,
   respectively for 2003.
(2)In 2004, the Fund has reduced its use of short-term trading strategies
   designed to capture dividend income and has made increased use of realized
   gains to supplement its investment income. Until the Fund utilizes all of
   its tax loss carryforwards, distributions to shareholders derived from such
   realized gains will be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. In
   addition, the reduced use of short-term trading strategies has reduced the
   Fund's portfolio turnover rate.

          2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

          3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets,
and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement
of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
report;

          4. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and have:

          (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

          (b) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date within 90
days prior to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

          (c) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of
an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

          5. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed
to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and

          (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
over financial reporting.
