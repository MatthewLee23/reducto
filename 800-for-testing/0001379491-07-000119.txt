Semi-Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the semi-annual reporting
period ended April 30, 2007. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under
the New York Stock Exchange symbol "AFB". Effective May 18, 2007, Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund changed its name to AllianceBernstein National
Municipal Income Fund. The Board of Directors approved the name change at the
recommendation of AllianceBernstein L.P., the Fund's investment
adviser, to brand the Fund with the same AllianceBernstein name used for other
funds in the AllianceBernstein family of funds. As of the close of business
on May 18, 2007, the Fund acquired all of the net assets and assumed the
liabilities of ACM Municipal Securities Income Fund, pursuant to a plan of
reorganization approved by the shareholders of ACM Municipal Securities Income
Fund.

Investment Objective and Policies

This closed-end fund seeks to provide high current income exempt from regular
federal income tax by investing substantially all of its net assets in
municipal securities that pay interest that is exempt from federal income tax.
The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal
securities paying interest that is exempt from regular federal income tax. The
Fund also normally will invest at least 75% of its assets in investment-grade
municipal securities or unrated municipal securities considered to be of
comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds rated below investment grade and unrated municipal bonds
considered to be of comparable quality as determined by the Fund's investment
adviser. The Fund intends to invest primarily in municipal securities that pay
interest that is not subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"),
but may invest without limit in municipal securities paying interest that is
subject to the federal AMT. For more information regarding the Fund's risks,
please see "A Word About Risk" on page 3 and "Note G--Risks Involved in
Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to Financial Statements on page 28.

Investment Results

The table on page 4 provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended April 30, 2007.

The Fund underperformed its benchmark during the six-month reporting period
ended April 30, 2007, and outperformed the benchmark during the 12-month period
ended April 30, 2007. The Fund's relative underperformance during the six-month
period under review was largely the result of security selection in the
pre-refunded and industrial revenue bond sectors. Security selection in the
hospital and special tax sectors was beneficial to performance.

In general, the Fund's leveraged structure did not aid performance relative to
the benchmark over the six-month reporting period as both short- and long-term
rates rose. Over the 12-month


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 1


period, however, long-term rates declined and short-term rates were nearly
unchanged and, as a result, the Fund's leveraged structure benefited relative
performance.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

Short-term rates rising more than long-term rates and a continued strong bid
for lower-quality bonds drove municipal bond returns over the six-month
reporting period. Consistent with the pattern in the U.S. Treasury market, in
general, the shorter the municipal bond's maturity, the more its yield
increased over the past six months. Yields for bonds maturing within 20 years
rose by up to 0.15%; those maturing in 30 years rose only 0.03%.

The difference between long-term and short-term municipal bonds is near the
lowest that it has been over the past 30 years. The average of this difference
has been 230 basis points since the early 1970s and is a mere 43 basis points
today. Issuers responded to low long-term interest rates by selling a record
$104 billion in bonds during the first quarter of 2007--49% more than the same
period in 2006.

Investors' demand for income continued to be a significant influence in the
municipal market. High-yield municipal funds accounted for about 40% of the
money invested in municipal mutual funds. Speculative-grade bonds were the
best-performing sector as demand drove prices up, causing the LB Municipal High
Yield Index to return 3.41%--over twice the 1.59% return of the LB Municipal
Index which represents only the investment-grade portion of the municipal
market.

One result of the continued strong performance of lower-rated bonds is that the
extra yield for assuming credit risk is very small by historical standards. For
example, the difference in yield between intermediate BBB-rated and AAA-rated
insured municipal bonds stood at only 0.23% at quarter-end. A widening of just
0.05% would negate the income benefit of owning lower-rated bonds over a
12-month period.

The low levels of compensation for assuming credit risk or interest rate risk
have been engendered, at least in part, by benign economic and inflation
outlooks, as well as by the strongest municipal balance sheets in a very long
time. It is impossible to know when investors will become more risk averse, or
what the catalyst will be. However, with so little reward for taking risk, the
Fund's Municipal Bond Investment Team found the best values in high-quality
bonds and has focused new purchases on bonds maturing in 10-15 years rather
than longer maturities which provide only marginally more income.

For additional shareholder information regarding this Fund, please see page 42.

Benchmark Disclosure

The unmanaged Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a fund portfolio. The Index
is a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment grade,
tax-exempt bond market. An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and its
results are not indicative of the performance for any specific investment,
including the Fund.

A Word About Risk

Among the risks of investing in the Fund are changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Changes in interest
rates have a greater effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with
shorter maturities. Please note, as interest rates rise, existing bond prices
fall and can cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline. While
the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in
order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of
the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds that are rated below investment grade (i.e., "junk bonds").
These securities involve greater volatility and risk than higher-quality
fixed-income securities.

Leverage Risk - The Fund may use certain investment techniques that have
increased risks. For example, the issuance of the Fund's preferred stock
results in leveraging of the Common Stock, an investment technique usually
considered speculative. The Fund utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the
yield and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot
be achieved in all interest rate environments. Leverage creates certain risks
for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both the net asset
value and market value of the Common Stock, and fluctuations in the dividend
rates on the Preferred Stock will affect the return to holders of Common Stock.
To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and
if short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends
paid on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income
available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset
value of the Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock
Exchange) may, as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates
rise, the Common Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the
price of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred
Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the
market value of the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2007 (unaudited)

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange (other than securities listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market,
Inc. ("NASDAQ")) or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities listed only on NASDAQ are valued in
accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call options
are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that day, such
securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open futures
contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement price or,
in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are
no quotations available for the day of valuation, the last available closing
settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter market,
("OTC") are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices as reported
by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable sources; U.S. government
securities and other debt instruments having 60 days or less remaining until
maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or
less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if
their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities,
including mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued on the
basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one
or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are
obtained, AllianceBernstein L.P. (the "Adviser") may establish proce-


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 23


dures whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a
daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other
derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a
major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To
the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, prior to February 12,
2007, the Fund paid the Adviser an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1%
of the Fund's average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred
shareholders. As of February 12, 2007, the Fund pays the Adviser an advisory
fee at an annual rate of .55% of the Fund's average daily net assets applicable
to common and preferred stockholders. Such fee is accrued daily and paid
monthly.


24 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fees or reimburse
the Fund for expenses in the amount of .25% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders for the first 5 full
years of the Fund's operations, .20% for the period January 28, 2007 until
February 12, 2007, .10% for year 6 (such waiver commencing February 12 of year
6) and .05% for year 7. The Fund commenced operations on January 28, 2002. For
the six months ended April 30, 2007 the amount of such fees waived was $462,570.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with
AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc. ("ABIS"), an affiliate of the
Adviser, the Fund reimburses ABIS for costs relating to servicing phone
inquiries for the Fund.During the six months ended April 30, 2007, there was no
reimbursement paid to ABIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the six months ended April 30, 2007, were as follows:

                                              Purchases           Sales
                                            =============     =============
Investment securities (excluding
  U.S. government securities)               $ 24,814,666      $ 27,199,133
U.S. government securities                            -0-               -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes, was substantially the
same as the cost for financial repotings purposes. Accordingly, gross
unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap
transactions) are as follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation                                 $  26,697,383
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (107,221)
                                                              -------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                   $  26,590,162
                                                              =============


1. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of
the contract. Therefore,


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 25


the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a swap contract
in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may arise from
unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the underlying
securities.

As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments on
swap contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss
recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of operations.
Prior to November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within
interest income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the
value of swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

2. Financial Futures Contracts

The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts for the purpose of hedging
the portfolio against adverse effects of anticipated movements in the market.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of these
financial instruments and the imperfect correlation between movements in the
price of the futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities
hedged or used for cover.

At the time the Fund enters into a futures contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral an initial margin with the broker, as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are
known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
losses. Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to
meet the terms of the contract. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract
at the time it was opened and the time it was closed.

NOTE D
Common Stock

There are 20,520,824 shares of common stock outstanding at April 30, 2007.
During the six months ended April 30, 2007, the Fund issued 6,023 shares in
connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. During the year ended
October 31, 2006, the Fund issued 43,134 shares in connection with the Fund's
reinvestment plan.


26 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE E
Preferred Stock

The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction
Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series M, T, W and TH. The dividend rate on the Series M is 3.94%
effective through May 7, 2007. The dividend rate on the Series T is 3.85%
effective through May 1, 2007. The dividend rate on the Series W is
3.88% effective through May 2, 2007. The dividend rate on the Series TH is
3.92% effective through May 3, 2007.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

NOTE F
Distributions To Common Shareholders

The tax character of distributions to be paid for the year ended October 31,
2007 will be determined at the end of the current fiscal year. The tax
character of distributions paid to common shareholders during the fiscal years
ended October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 were as follows:

                                                2006              2005

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 27


As of October 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                                $    101,375
Accumulated capital and other losses                             (1,116,788)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                           29,844,434(b)
                                                               ---------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                           $ 28,829,021(c)
                                                               ---------------

(a)  On October 31, 2006, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$1,116,788 of which $1,106,582 expires in the year 2011, and $10,206 expires in
the year 2012. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed. During the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $337,555.

(b)  The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributed primarily to the difference between
the book and tax treatment of swap income.

(c)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis components of accumulated
earnings/(deficit) is attributable primarily to dividends payable.

NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Leverage Risk--The Fund may use certain investment techniques that have
increased risks. For example, the issuance of the Fund's preferred stock
results in leveraging of the Common Stock, an investment technique usually
considered speculative. The Fund utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the
yield and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot
be achieved in all interest rate environments. Leverage creates certain risks
for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both the net asset
value and market value of the Common Stock and fluctuations in the dividend
rates on the Preferred Stock will affect the return to holders of Common Stock.
To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and
if short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends
paid on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income
available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset
value of the Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the


28 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


market value of the Fund's Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the
New York Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term
interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset value will reflect the full
decline in the price of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the
Fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net
asset value, the market value of the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland (the "Mutual Fund MDL").
Management of the Adviser believes that these private lawsuits are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 29


an Assurance of Discontinuation dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAGOrder"). Among
the key provisions of these agreements are the following:

     (i)     The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
"Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse
effects of market timing attributable to market timing relationships described
in the SEC Order. According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be
paid, in order of priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share
of losses suffered by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate
share of advisory fees paid by such fund during the period of such market
timing;

    (ii)     The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from
some of the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing
January 1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and

   (iii)     The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the
Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it did not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

On February 10, 2004, the Adviser received (i) a subpoena duces tecum from the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia and (ii) a request
for information from West Virginia's Office of the State Auditor, Securities
Commission (the "West Virginia Securities Commissioner") (together, the
"Information Requests"). Both Information Requests require the Adviser to
produce documents concerning, among other things, any market timing or late
trading in the Adviser's sponsored mutual funds. The Adviser responded to the
Information Requests and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

On April 11, 2005, a complaint entitled The Attorney General of the State of
West Virginia v. AIM Advisors, Inc., et al. ("WVAG Complaint") was filed
against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. ("Alliance
Holding"), and various other defendants not affiliated with the Adviser. The
WVAG Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia
by the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia. The WVAG Complaint makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in certain of the complaints
related to the lawsuits discussed above. On October 19, 2005, the WVAG
Complaint was transferred to the Mutual Fund MDL.


30 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


Notes to Financial Statements

On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner signed a Summary
Order to Cease and Desist, and Notice of Right to Hearing addressed to the
Adviser and Alliance Holding. The Summary Order claims that the Adviser and
Alliance Holding violated the West Virginia Uniform Securities Act, and makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in the SEC Order and the NYAG
Order. On January 25, 2006, the Adviser and Alliance Holding moved to vacate
the Summary Order. In early Setember 2006, the court denied this motion, and
the Supreme Court of Appeals in West Virginia denied the defendants' petition
for appeal. On September 22, 2006, the Adviser and Alliance Holding filed an
answer and moved to dismiss the Summary Order with the West Virginia Securities
Commissioner.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Fund was not named as a defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The
Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by alleged shareholders of an AllianceBernstein mutual
fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things, (i) that certain of the
defendants improperly authorized the payment of excessive commissions and other
fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in exchange for preferential marketing
services, (ii) that certain of the defendants misrepresented and omitted from
registration statements and other reports material facts concerning such
payments, and (iii) that certain defendants caused such conduct as control
persons of other defendants. The Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation
of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206
and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding
and abetting breaches of common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of
their contracts with the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the
Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees,
commissions and soft dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or
discriminatorily obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, nine additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants. All nine of the lawsuits (i) were brought
as class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, (ii) assert claims substantially identical to the Aucoin
Complaint, and (iii) are brought on behalf of shareholders of the Funds.

On February 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action
complaint ("Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint") that asserts claims
substantially similar to the Aucoin Complaint and the nine additional lawsuits
referenced above. On October 19, 2005, the District Court dismissed each of the
claims set forth in the Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint, except for
plaintiffs' claim under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. On January
11, 2006, the District Court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and
dismissed the remaining Section 36(b) claim. On May 31, 2006 the District Court
denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On July 5,
2006, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal which was subsequently withdrawn
subject to plaintiffs' right to reinstate it at a later date.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

NOTE I
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing a fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
would be recorded in the current period. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
tax years as of the effective date. On December 22, 2006, the Securities and
Exchange Commission notified the industry that the implementation of FIN 48 by
registered investment companies could be delayed until the last business day of
the first required financial statement reporting period for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial statements has not yet
been determined.

On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 establishes an
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. The
application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is evaluating the implications of FAS 157 and its impact on the
financial statements has not yet been determined.

34 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


(a)  As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however, prior to
November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. For the year ended October 31,
2004, the effect of this change to the net investment income and the net
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions was less than
$0.01 per share and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets
was .00%.

(b)  Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(e)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(f)  These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(g)  Annualized.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 37


Information Regarding the Review and Approval of the Fund's Advisory Agreement

The disinterested directors (the "directors") of Alliance National Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") unanimously approved the continuance of the
Advisory Agreement (amended to reduce the contractual fee rate by 10 basis
points as discussed under "Advisory Fee and Other Expenses" below) with the
Adviser at a meeting held on February 7-8, 2007.

Prior to approval of the continuance of the Advisory Agreement, the directors
requested and received and evaluated extensive materials from the Adviser. They
reviewed the proposed continuance of the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser
and with experienced counsel who are independent of the Adviser who advised on
the relevant legal standards. The directors also discussed the proposed
continuance in five private sessions with counsel and the Fund's Independent
Compliance Officer.

The directors considered their knowledge of the nature and quality of the
services provided by the Adviser to the Fund gained from their experience as
directors or trustees of most of the registered investment companies advised by
the Adviser, their overall confidence in the Adviser's integrity and competence
they have gained from that experience, the Adviser's initiative in identifying
and raising potential issues with the directors and its responsiveness,
frankness and attention to concerns raised by the directors in the past,
including the Adviser's willingness to consider and implement organizational
and operational changes designed to improve investment results and the services
provided to the AllianceBernstein Funds. The directors noted that they have
four regular meetings each year, at each of which they receive presentations
from the Adviser on the investment results of the Fund and review extensive
materials and information presented by the Adviser.

The directors also considered all other factors they believed relevant,
including the specific matters discussed below. In their deliberations, the
directors did not identify any particular information that was all-important or
controlling, and different directors may have attributed different weights to
the various factors. The directors determined that the selection of the Adviser
to manage the Fund and the overall arrangements between the Fund and the
Adviser, as provided in the Advisory Agreement, including the advisory fee
reduction approved at the meeting, were fair and reasonable in light of the
services performed, expenses incurred and such other matters as the directors
considered relevant in the exercise of their business judgment. The material
factors and conclusions that formed the basis for the directors' determinations
included the following:

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided

The directors considered the scope and quality of services provided by the
Adviser under the Advisory Agreement, including the quality of the investment
research capabilities of the Adviser and the other resources it has dedicated
to


38 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


performing services for the Fund. They also noted the professional experience
and qualifications of the Fund's portfolio management team and other senior
personnel of the Adviser. The directors also considered that a provision in the
Advisory Agreement for the Fund provides that the Fund will reimburse the
Adviser for the cost of certain clerical, accounting, administrative and other
services provided at the Fund's request by employees of the Adviser or its
affiliates. The directors noted that the Adviser has not requested such
reimbursements from the Fund. Requests for these "at no more than cost"
reimbursements are approved by the directors on a quarterly basis and (to the
extent requested and paid) result in a higher rate of total compensation from
the Fund to the Adviser than the fee rate stated in the Advisory Agreement. The
quality of administrative and other services, including the Adviser's role in
coordinating the activities of the Fund's other service providers, also were
considered. The directors concluded that, overall, they were satisfied with the
nature, extent and quality of services provided to the Fund under the Advisory
Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability

The directors reviewed a schedule of the revenues and expenses indicating the
profitability of the Fund to the Adviser for calendar years 2004 and 2005 that
had been prepared with an updated expense allocation methodology arrived at in
consultation with an independent consultant. The directors noted that the
updated expense allocation methodology differed in various respects from the
methodology used in prior years. The directors reviewed the assumptions and
methods of allocation used by the Adviser in preparing fund-specific
profitability data. The directors recognized that it is difficult to make
comparisons of profitability from fund advisory contracts because comparative
information is not generally publicly available and is affected by numerous
factors. In considering profitability information, the directors considered the
effect of fall-out benefits on the Adviser's expenses. The directors focused on
the profitability of the Adviser's relationship with the Fund before taxes. The
directors concluded that they were satisfied that the Adviser's level of
profitability from its relationship with the Fund was not excessive.

Fall-Out Benefits

The directors considered that the Adviser benefits from soft dollar
arrangements whereby it receives brokerage and research services from many of
the brokers and dealers that execute purchases and sales of securities on
behalf of its clients on an agency basis. The directors noted that since the
Fund does not engage in brokerage transactions, the Adviser does not receive
soft dollar benefits in respect of portfolio transactions of the Fund. The
directors also noted that a subsidiary of the Adviser provides certain
shareholder services to the Fund and receives compensation from the Fund for
such services. The directors recognized that the Adviser's profitability would
be somewhat lower without these benefits. The directors understood that the
Adviser also might derive reputational and other benefits from its association
with the Fund.


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 39


Investment Results

In addition to the information reviewed by the directors in connection with the
meeting, the directors receive detailed comparative performance information for
the Fund at each regular Board meeting during the year. At the meeting, the
directors reviewed information prepared by the Adviser showing performance of
the Fund as compared to other funds in the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds
Average (Leveraged) (the "Lipper Average") for periods ended June 30, 2006 over
the year to date ("YTD"), 1- and 3-year and since inception periods (January
2002 inception) and for each of the last three calendar years, and as compared
to the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the "Index") for periods ended
June 30, 2006 over the YTD, 1- and 3-year and since inception periods. The
directors noted that in the Lipper Average comparison, the Fund's performance
was above the Lipper medians in all periods reviewed. The directors further
noted that the Fund outperformed the Index in all periods reviewed. The
directors noted that the Fund utilizes leverage whereas the Index is not
leveraged. Based on their review, the directors concluded that the Fund's
relative performance over time was satisfactory.

Advisory Fees and Other Expenses

The directors considered the latest fiscal period actual advisory fees paid by
the Fund to the Adviser and information prepared by Lipper concerning fee rates
paid by other funds in the same Lipper category as the Fund. The directors also
took into account their general knowledge of advisory fees paid by open-end and
closed-end funds that invest in fixed-income municipal securities. The
directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of advisory fees
because there are variations in the services that are included in the fees paid
by other funds.

The directors noted that in connection with the settlement of the market timing
matter with the New York Attorney General in December 2003, the Adviser agreed
to material reductions (averaging 20%) in the fee schedules of most of the
open-end funds sponsored by the Adviser and that such open-end funds had
benefited from such fee reductions since 2004.

The Adviser informed the directors that there are no institutional products
managed by it that have a substantially similar investment style as the Fund.
The directors reviewed information in the Adviser's Form ADV and noted that it
charges institutional clients lower fees for advising comparably sized accounts
using strategies that differ from those of the Fund but which involved
investments in securities of the same type that the Fund invests in (i.e.,
fixed income municipal). They had previously received an oral presentation from
the Adviser that supplemented the information in the Form ADV. The Adviser
reviewed with the directors the significantly greater scope of the services it
provides the Fund relative to institutional clients. In light of this
information, the directors did not place significant weight on these fee
comparisons.


40 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


The directors also considered the total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
to the fees and expenses of funds within two comparison groups created by
Lipper: an Expense Group and an Expense Universe. Lipper described an Expense
Group as a representative sample of comparable funds and an Expense Universe as
a broader group, consisting of all funds in the Fund's investment
classification/objective. The expense ratio of the Fund was based on the Fund's
latest fiscal year expense ratio and reflected fee waivers and/or expense
reimbursements as contemplated in the prospectus for the Fund's initial public
offering. The directors recognized that the expense ratio information for the
Fund potentially reflected on the Adviser's provision of services, as the
Adviser is responsible for coordinating services provided to the Fund by
others. The directors noted that it was likely that the expense ratios of some
funds in the Fund's Lipper category were lowered by waivers or reimbursements
by those funds' investment advisers, which in some cases were voluntary and
perhaps temporary.

The information reviewed by the directors showed that the Fund's latest fiscal
year actual advisory fees of 64.5 basis points was significantly lower than the
Expense Group and Expense Universe medians. The directors noted that Lipper
calculates the fee rate based on the Fund's net assets attributable to common
stockholders, whereas the Fund's Advisory Agreement provides that fees are
computed based on average daily net assets (i.e., including assets supported by
the Fund's preferred stock). The directors also noted that the Fund's fee rate
reflects a fee waiver arrangement that provides for the waiver amount to be
gradually reduced over four years commencing after the fifth full year of
operations of the Fund, and that the Fund commenced operations in January 2002.
The directors noted that the Adviser, in response to a request from the
directors, had agreed in November 2006 to a reduction to the Fund's contractual
advisory fee rate from .65% to .55% such that when the waivers have been fully
phased out the fee rate payable by the Fund will be 10 basis points less than
it otherwise would have been. Finally, the directors noted that the Fund's
total expense ratio was lower than the Expense Group and Expense Universe
medians. The directors concluded that the Fund's expense ratio was satisfactory.

Economies of Scale

The directors considered that the Fund is a closed-end fund and that it was not
expected to have meaningful asset growth as a result. In such circumstances,
the directors did not view the potential for realization of economies of scale
as the Fund's assets grow to be a material factor in their deliberations. The
directors noted that if the Fund's net assets were to increase materially as a
result of, e.g., an acquisition or rights offering, they would review whether
potential economies of scale would be realized. They further noted that the
Fund's pending acquisition subject to stockholder approvals, of all of the
assets and liabilities of ACM Municipal Income Fund, Inc., was one of the
reasons they have requested a reduction in the Fund's contractual fee rate.
