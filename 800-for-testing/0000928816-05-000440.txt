Dear Fellow Shareholder:

During the past several months, Putnam has introduced a number of reforms
for the benefit of shareholders, including increasing the amount of
disclosure for our funds. We are now including additional disclosure about
your fund's management team. Following the Outlook for Your Fund, we
provide manager compensation information that pertains to your fund and
list any changes in your fund's Portfolio Leader and Portfolio Members
during the prior year period, as well as these individuals' other fund
management responsibilities at Putnam. We also show how much these
individuals have invested in the fund (in dollar ranges), and fund
ownership (in dollar ranges) is also shown for the members of Putnam's
Executive Board. Finally, on page 13, we provide certain information about
the most recent approval of your fund's management contract with Putnam by
the Trustees.

We are also pleased to announce that three new Trustees have joined your
fund's Board of Trustees. Nominated by your fund's independent Trustees,
these individuals have had outstanding careers as leaders in the
investment management industry. Myra R. Drucker is a Vice Chair of the
Board of Trustees of Sarah Lawrence College and serves as ex-officio
member and past Chair of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Pension
Managers Advisory Committee and as a Trustee of Commonfund, a
not-for-profit asset management firm. Richard B. Worley is Managing
Partner of Permit Capital LLC, an investment management firm. Both Ms.
Drucker and Mr. Worley are independent Trustees (i.e., Trustees who are
not "interested persons" of your fund or its investment advisor). Charles
E. Haldeman, Jr., the third new Trustee, is President and Chief Executive
Officer of Putnam Investments. We also announce the departure of one of
your fund's Trustees, A.J.C. Smith, formerly Chairman of Putnam
Investments and Consultant to Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Finally, we would like to welcome shareholders of Putnam Master Income
Trust, a multi-sector fixed-income fund with a similar objective and
strategy as your fund, who have become shareholders of this fund as a
result of a recently completed merger between the two funds.

In the following pages, your fund's management team discusses performance,
strategy, and its outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2005.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

 * See the Performance Summary beginning on page 10 for additional fund
   performance,  comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

During the past six months, shorter-maturity bond yields have risen as
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has continued its gradual
series of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, yields on longer-term
bonds declined somewhat, responding to generally moderate global
inflation. Longer-maturity bond performance was also bolstered by
increased demand from pension funds. The fund's high-yield and
emerging-market bonds performed well, enabling the fund to outperform
its benchmark by a significant margin although results at NAV lagged the
average for the fund's Lipper category. It is important to note that a
fund's performance at market price may differ from its results at NAV.
Although market price performance generally reflects investment results,
it may also be influenced by several other factors, including changes in
investor perceptions of the fund or its investment advisor, market
conditions, fluctuations in supply and demand for the fund's shares, and
changes in fund distributions.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Premier Income Trust is designed for investors seeking a high
level of current income. The fund maintains flexibility across three
sectors -- U.S. government and agencies, high-yield corporate, and
international -- to seek maximum current income without undue risk to
capital. The fund may be appropriate for investors seeking a higher
level of income who can accept a moderately higher level of risk.



Market overview

Global bond markets have enjoyed a favorable set of circumstances during
the past six months. Most sectors have produced positive returns, with
riskier sectors -- including corporate high-yield bonds and
emerging-market bonds -- continuing to outperform the higher-quality
investment-grade corporate, government, and agency sectors. While
short-term interest rates generally rose during the period, following
the Fed's lead, the Fed's clear communication of its tightening policy
and its measured pace of rate increases resulted in no surprises. This
clarity was beneficial for longer-term bondholders, who remained focused
on economic data. Consequently, while the federal funds rate rose from
1.00% in June 2004 to 2.50% on February 2, 2005 (just after the end of
the reporting period), long-term rates moved downward, as low inflation
and stable economic conditions helped investors remain generally
positive. The rise in short rates and decline in long rates therefore
caused a narrowing in the spread between the two, causing the yield
curve -- a graphical depiction of all bond yields -- to flatten.

Although turmoil continued in Iraq and the Middle East, other
uncertainties that have preoccupied investors -- including fears of
terrorism and the close U.S. presidential election -- have lessened.
Generally positive economic conditions, low interest rates on
high-quality bonds, and a weak dollar drew investors into riskier bond
sectors that provided higher income levels. As a result, high-yield
corporate bonds and emerging-market securities outperformed. In the
high-yield sector, default rates continued to decline, and, combined
with positive global economic growth, attracted investors and resulted
in strong demand for these securities. Emerging markets generally
benefited from high energy and commodities prices, solid economic
growth, and an overall reduction of perceived risk. The weak dollar also
helped bolster returns in emerging-market securities for U.S. investors.

Strategy overview

While the fund's emerging-market and high-yield corporate bond holdings
provided the strongest performance, we had begun trimming these
positions before the period began and reduced these weightings further
during the period. These sectors have seen such strong performance over
the past few years that we believed they were no longer attractively
valued. Moreover, although global economic growth continued at a solid
pace, it has slowed from prior years.

Within the high-yield corporate sector, we upgraded credit quality by
selling CCC-rated and B-rated bonds and buying bonds with BB-ratings. We
used the proceeds of the sales to increase the fund's weighting in
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), asset-backed securities (ABSs), and
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), all of which had solid
returns during the period. These securities are generally high in credit
quality and have shorter maturities, or durations, meaning that they are
likely to be less sensitive to an increase in interest rates. Moreover,
their shorter maturities give us the flexibility to reinvest more
frequently, which would be beneficial if interest rates were to rise. We
found CMBSs particularly attractive because they offered higher yields
than corporate bonds of roughly the same credit quality.

We increased the fund's position in bank loans during the period. These
securities offer a higher level of credit quality than high-yield bonds.
In addition, they offer floating interest rates that, like an adjustable
home mortgage, move with market rates and therefore can provide
protection of principal from interest-rate risk.

How fund holdings and sectors affected performance

As already mentioned, we reduced the fund's exposure to corporate
high-yield bonds and increased its allocation to mortgage-backed
securities (MBSs), asset-backed securities (ABSs), and commercial
mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). Within the MBS group, we acquired
high-coupon GNMA (Government National Mortgage Association) securities,
which were less likely to be prepaid and therefore performed well. The
fund also owned reperforming GNMAs, which are traditional MBSs in which
the borrowers have become delinquent in making payments for a period of
time. As a result, these securities are less likely to be refinanced
than other types of MBSs. We believed the reperforming GNMAs did not
represent a major credit risk, and the fund benefited from the higher
income that they produced.

The fund's CMBS holdings performed well, as investors were attracted to
their combination of relatively high income and strong credit quality.
These securities are backed both by the issuers that pool the securities
and the individual corporations issuing the mortgages. Given the
relative strength of the economic recovery over the past few years, this
credit quality has generally been strong.

The fund's holdings will change over time.


The fund's international government bond holdings, including bonds from
the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Canada, performed well,
responding to solid economic growth and declining longer-term interest
rates. The fund's European government holdings were also bolstered by
the currency effect of the weak dollar.

Although the fund's emerging-market weighting had been reduced prior to
the beginning of the period, we continued to pare back these  holdings
during their strong performance of the past six months. These securities
have performed well over the past several years as a result of strong
growth in many emerging-market countries, due to gains in manufacturing
and exports to other rapidly growing countries, as well as exports of
metals, oil, and natural gas, all of which have risen significantly in
price. Bonds from Russia, Colombia, and Brazil delivered particularly
strong performance.

Finally, with over 10% of the fund's assets invested in foreign bonds,
currency appreciation due to the decline in the dollar versus other
major currencies -- especially the euro -- made a significant and
positive contribution to returns.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in
the future.

OF SPECIAL INTEREST

Merger with Putnam Master Income Trust completed

During the period, shareholders of Putnam Master Income Trust and Putnam
Premier Income Trust approved a merger of Putnam Master Income Trust
into Putnam Premier Income Trust, and the merger was recently completed
on February 28, 2005. Putnam Master Income Trust is a closed-end,
multi-sector fixed-income fund whose objectives, strategy, and
investments are substantially similar to those of your fund. The merger,
which occurred on February 25, 2005, should result in lower expenses for
shareholders of each fund due to the larger asset base of the combined
fund.



The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

The past two years have seen strong returns in the emerging and
high-yield corporate bond markets, reflecting a global economic
recovery. We continue to believe, as we did six months ago, that certain
headwinds could have a negative impact on the performance of
lower-quality bond sectors. First, the current high level of energy
prices may act as a tax and reduce both consumer and corporate spending.
And second, higher short-term interest rates and lower long-term
interest rates have resulted in a flattening of the yield curve, which
represents yields on bonds of all maturities. This flattening has
reduced the incentive for investors to take more risk by buying
longer-maturity bonds. Similarly, the narrowing of the credit yield
spread -- the difference in yield between lower- and higher-quality
bonds -- has also reduced the incentive for investors to take on greater
credit risk because lower-quality bonds are not paying as high an
interest rate as they did a year or two ago.

On the positive side, inflation remains low and there do not appear to
be any imminent threats to the stability of the global economy, which is
still growing at a solid, positive rate. Nevertheless, we have
positioned the fund to have a shorter average maturity and shorter
duration -- or lower interest-rate sensitivity -- and we have generally
improved the overall credit quality in the portfolio. We believe these
are prudent measures given the current state of the global economy and
bond markets.


The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. International
investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations,
economic instability, and political developments. Additional risks may
be associated with emerging-market securities, including illiquidity and
volatility. Mutual funds that invest in bonds are subject to certain
risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation risk. As
interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds are more
exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike bonds, bond
funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher
yields in return for more risk. Mutual funds that invest in government
securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to
prepayment risk.

assuming you held the shares through the entire period and reinvested
all distributions in the fund.

Net asset value (NAV) is the value of all your fund's assets, minus any
liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares.

Market price is the current trading price of one share of the fund.
Market prices are set by transactions between buyers and sellers on
exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock
Exchange.

Trustee approval of
management contract

General conclusions

The Board of Trustees of the Putnam funds oversees the management of
each fund and, as required by law, determines annually whether to
approve the continuance of each fund's management contract with Putnam
Management. In this regard the Board of Trustees, with the assistance of
its Contract Committee consisting solely of Independent Trustees,
requests and evaluates all information it deems reasonably necessary in
the circumstances. Over the course of several months beginning in March
and ending in June of 2004, the Contract Committee reviewed the
information provided by Putnam Management and other information
developed with the assistance of the Board's independent counsel and
independent staff. The Contract Committee reviewed and discussed key
aspects of this information with all of the Independent Trustees. Upon
completion of this review, the Contract Committee recommended and the
Independent Trustees approved the continuance of your fund's contract,
effective July 1, 2004.

This approval was based on the following conclusions:

* That the fee schedule currently in effect for your fund represents
  reasonable compensation in light of the nature and quality of the
  services being provided to the fund, the fees paid by competitive funds
  and the costs incurred by Putnam Management in providing such service,
  and

* That such fee schedule represents an appropriate sharing between fund
  shareholders and Putnam Management of such economies of scale as may
  exist in the management of the fund at current asset levels.

These conclusions were based on a comprehensive consideration of all
information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any
single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the
Trustees' deliberations are described below.

Model fee schedules and categories; total expenses

The Trustees, working in cooperation with Putnam Management, have
developed and implemented a series of model fee schedules for the Putnam
funds designed to ensure that each fund's management fee is consistent
with the fees for similar funds in the Putnam complex and compares
favorably with fees paid by competitive funds sponsored by other advisors.
The Trustees reviewed the model fee schedule currently in effect for the
fund, including fee levels and breakpoints, and the assignment of the fund
to a particular fee category under this structure. The Trustees also
reviewed comparative fee and expense information for competitive funds.
The Trustees concluded that no changes should be made in the fund's
current fee schedule at this time. The Trustees noted that expense ratios
for a number of Putnam funds had been increasing recently as a result of
declining net assets and the natural operation of fee breakpoints. They
noted that such expense ratio increases were currently being controlled by
expense limitations implemented in January 2004. They also noted that the
competitive landscape regarding mutual fund fees may be changing as a
result of fee reductions accepted by various other fund groups in
connection with recent regulatory settlements and greater focus on fees
and expenses in the mutual fund industry generally. The Trustees indicated
an intention to monitor these developments closely.

Economies of scale

As noted above, the Trustees concluded that the fee schedule currently
in effect for your fund represents an appropriate sharing of economies
of scale at current asset levels. The Trustees indicated their intention
to continue their ongoing consideration of economies of scale and in
particular to consider further the possible operation of such economies
in the event that a significant recovery in the equity markets or net
fund sales were to raise asset levels substantially above current
levels. In this regard, the Trustees noted that they had reviewed data
relating to the substantial increase in asset levels of the Putnam funds
that occurred during the years leading up to the market peak in 2000,
the subsequent decline in assets and the resulting impact on revenues
and expenses of Putnam Management. The Trustees also noted that recent
declines in net assets in many Putnam funds, together with significant
changes in the cost structure of Putnam Management have altered the
economics of Putnam Management's business in significant ways. The
Trustees concluded that they would monitor these changes carefully and
evaluate the resulting impact on Putnam Management's economics and the
sharing of economies of scale between the parties.

Investment performance

The quality of the investment process provided by Putnam Management
represented a major factor in the Trustees' evaluation of the quality of
services provided by Putnam Management under the Management Contracts.
The Trustees recognized that a high quality investment process -- as
measured by the experience and skills of the individuals assigned to the
management of fund portfolios, the resources made available to such
personnel, and in general the ability of Putnam Management to attract
and retain high-quality personnel -- does not guarantee favorable
investment results for every fund in every time period. The Trustees
considered the investment performance of each fund over multiple time
periods and considered information comparing the fund's performance with
various benchmarks and with the performance of competitive funds. The
Trustees noted the satisfactory investment performance of many Putnam
funds.


They also noted the disappointing investment performance of certain
funds in recent years and continued to discuss with senior management of
Putnam Management the factors contributing to such under-performance and
actions being taken to improve performance. The Trustees recognized
that, in recent years, Putnam Management has made significant changes in
its investment personnel and processes and in the fund product line in
an effort to address areas of underperformance. The Trustees indicated
their intention to continue to monitor performance trends to assess the
effectiveness of these changes and to evaluate whether additional
remedial changes are warranted. As a general matter, the Trustees
concluded that consultation between the Trustees and Putnam Management
represents the most effective way to address investment performance
problems. The Trustees believe that investors in the Putnam funds and
their financial advisors have, as a general matter, effectively placed
their trust in the Putnam organization, under the supervision of the
funds' Trustees, to make appropriate decisions regarding the management
of the funds. The Trustees believe that the termination of the
Management Contract and engagement of a new investment adviser for
under-performing funds, with all the attendant disruptions, would not
serve the interests of fund shareholders at this time and would not
necessarily provide any greater assurance of improved investment
performance.

Brokerage and soft-dollar allocations; other benefits

The Trustees considered various potential benefits that Putnam
Management may receive in connection with the services it provides under
the Management Contract with your fund. These include principally
benefits related to brokerage and soft-dollar allocations, which pertain
mainly to funds investing in equity securities. The Trustees believe
that soft-dollar credits and other potential benefits associated with
the allocation of fund brokerage represent assets of the funds that
should be used for the benefit of fund shareholders. The Trustees noted
recent trends in the allocation of fund brokerage, including commission
costs, the allocation of brokerage to firms that provide research
services to Putnam Management, and the sources and application of
available soft-dollar credits. Effective December 31, 2003, reflecting a
decision made by the Trustees earlier that year, Putnam Management
ceased allocating brokerage in connection with the sale of fund shares.
In addition, in preparing its budget for commission allocations in 2004,
Putnam Management voluntarily reduced substantially the allocation of
brokerage commissions to acquire research services from third-party
service providers. In light of evolving best practices in the mutual
fund industry, the Trustees concluded that this practice should be
further curtailed and possibly eliminated in the near future. The
Trustees indicated that they would continue to monitor the allocation of
the funds' brokerage to ensure that the principle of "best price and
execution" remains paramount in the portfolio trading process.


Comparison of retail and institutional fee schedules

The information examined by the Trustees as part of the annual contract
reviews included information regarding fees charged by Putnam Management
and its affiliates to institutional clients such as defined benefit
pension plans and college endowments. This information included
comparison of such fees with fees charged to the Putnam funds, as well
as a detailed assessment of the differences in the services provided to
these two types of clients. The Trustees devoted special attention to
these issues and reviewed recent articles by critics of mutual fund
fees, articles by the ICI defending such fee differences, and relevant
guidance provided by decisions of the courts. The Trustees observed, in
this regard, that the differences in fee rates between institutional
clients and mutual funds are by no means uniform when examined by
individual asset sectors, suggesting that differences in the pricing of
investment management services to these types of clients reflects to a
substantial degree historical competitive forces operating in separate
market places. In reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered
the fact that fee rates across all asset sectors are higher on average
for mutual funds than for institutional clients, and also considered the
differences between the services that Putnam provides to the Putnam
funds and those that it provides to institutional clients of the firm.

Settlement of regulatory charges related to market timing

Finally, in reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered all
matters pertinent to the administrative charges filed against Putnam
Management by the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in October
2003 relating to market timing, the firm's settlement of those charges,
and the conclusions and recommendations of the Trustees' Audit and
Pricing Committee based on its review of these matters. The Trustees
considered the actions taken by the owner of Putnam Management and its
new senior management to terminate or discipline the individuals
involved, to implement new compliance systems, to indemnify the funds
against all costs and liabilities related to these matters, and
otherwise to ensure that the interests of the funds and their
shareholders are fully protected. The Trustees noted that, in addition
to the settlements of the regulatory charges which will provide
comprehensive restitution for any losses suffered by shareholders, the
new senior management of Putnam Management has moved aggressively to
control expense ratios of funds affected by market timing, to reduce
charges to new investors, to improve disclosure of fees and expenses,
and to emphasize the paramount role of investment performance in
achieving shareholders' investment goals.

Notes to financial statements
January 31, 2005 (Unaudited)


Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Premier Income Trust (the "fund"), a Massachusetts business
trust, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
The fund's investment objective is to seek high current income
consistent with the preservation of capital by allocating its
investments among the U.S. government sector, high yield sector and
international sector of the fixed-income securities market. The fund
invests in higher yielding, lower-rated bonds that have a higher rate of
default due to the nature of the investments.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at fair value on the basis
of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or dealers,
approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine valuations
for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using
methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and
various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders,
between securities. Many securities markets and exchanges outside the
U.S. close prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange and
therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such
exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain
days, the fund will fair value foreign securities taking into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. securities markets.
The number of days on which fair value prices will be used will depend
on market activity and it is possible that fair value prices will be
used by the fund to a significant extent. Securities quoted in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other
investments, including certain restricted securities, are valued at fair
value following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account Pursuant to an exemptive order from the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the fund may transfer
uninvested cash balances, including cash collateral received under
security lending arrangements, into a joint trading account along with
the cash of other registered investment companies and certain other
accounts managed by Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Putnam, LLC. These balances may be invested in issues of high-grade
short-term investments having maturities of up to 397 days for
collateral received under security lending arrangements and up to 90
days for other cash investments.

C) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income, net
of applicable withholding taxes, is recognized on the ex-dividend date
except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recognized as
soon as the fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash
dividends, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the
securities received. All premiums/discounts are amortized /accreted on a
yield-to-maturity basis. The fund earned certain fees in connection with
its senior loan purchasing activities. These fees are treated as market
discount and are recorded as income in the statement of operations.

D) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

E) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the
statement of assets and liabilities. Forward currency contracts
outstanding at period end, if any, are listed after the fund's
portfolio.

F) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures and
options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the hedged
instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the value of
the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for
the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is unable to
perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of assets
and liabilities. When the contract is closed, the fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at
the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Realized
gains and losses on purchased options are included in realized gains and
losses on investment securities. If a written call option is exercised,
the premium originally received is recorded as an addition to sales
proceeds. If a written put option is exercised, the premium originally
received is recorded as a reduction to the cost of investments.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in
the value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as "variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last
sale price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for
purchased options and the last ask price for written options. Options
traded over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers.
Futures and written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

G) Interest rate swap contracts The fund may enter into interest rate
swap contracts, which are arrangements between two parties to exchange
cash flows based on a notional principal amount, to manage the fund's
exposure to interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are marked to
market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if
any, is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made
are recorded as realized gains or loss. The fund could be exposed to
credit or market risk due to unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of
interest rates or if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to
perform. Risk of loss may exceed amounts recognized on the statement of
assets and liabilities. Interest rate swap contracts outstanding at
period end, if any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

H) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront or
periodic payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange
for the right to receive a contingent payment. The maximum amount of the
payment may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index
or security as a result of a related credit event. An upfront payment
received by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a
liability on the fund's books. An upfront payment made by the fund, as
the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset on the fund's books.
Periodic payments received or paid by the fund are recorded as realized
gains or losses. The credit default contracts are marked to market daily
based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is
recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a
result of a credit event or termination of the contract are recognized,
net of a proportional amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains
or losses. In addition to bearing the risk that the credit event will
occur, the fund could be exposed to market risk due to unfavorable
changes in interest rates or in the price of the underlying security or
index, the possibility that the fund may be unable to close out its
position at the same time or at the same price as if it had purchased
comparable publicly traded securities or that the counterparty may
default on its obligation to perform. Risks of loss may exceed amounts
recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities. Credit default
contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed after the fund's
portfolio.

I) TBA purchase commitments The fund may enter into "TBA" (to be
announced) commitments to purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a
future date beyond customary settlement time. Although the unit price has
been established, the principal value has not been finalized. However, the
amount of the commitments will not significantly differ from the principal
amount. The fund holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or
high-grade debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase
price, or the fund may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward
sale of other securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be
earned until settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered
securities themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the
security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date, which risk
is in addition to the risk of decline in the value of the fund's other
assets. Unsettled TBA purchase commitments are valued at fair value of the
underlying securities, according to the procedures described under
"Security valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market" daily and
the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an unrealized gain
or loss.

Although the fund will generally enter into TBA purchase commitments
with the intention of acquiring securities for its portfolio or for
delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, the fund may
dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if Putnam Management deems
it appropriate to do so.

J) TBA sale commitments The fund may enter into TBA sale commitments to
hedge its portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it
owns under delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale
commitments are not received until the contractual settlement date.
During the time a TBA sale commitment is outstanding, equivalent
deliverable securities or an offsetting TBA purchase commitment
deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as "cover"
for the transaction.

Unsettled TBA sale commitments are valued at fair value of the
underlying securities, generally according to the procedures described
under "Security valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market"
daily and the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an
unrealized gain or loss. If the TBA sale commitment is closed through
the acquisition of an offsetting purchase commitment, the fund realizes
a gain or loss. If the fund delivers securities under the commitment,
the fund realizes a gain or a loss from the sale of the securities based
upon the unit price established at the date the commitment was entered
into. TBA sale commitments outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

K) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk
of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will
bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the cash
collateral. Income from securities lending is included in investment
income on the statement of operations. At January 31, 2005, the value of
securities loaned amounted to $142,736. The fund received cash
collateral of $148,891 which is pooled with collateral of other Putnam
funds into 25 issuers of high grade short-term investments.

L) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable
to regulated investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund
to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At July 31, 2004, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $221,029,478
available to the extent allowed by the Code to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover   Expiration
- --------------------------------
   $26,204,240   July 31, 2007
    44,857,570   July 31, 2008
    24,930,247   July 31, 2009
    44,917,486   July 31, 2010
    80,119,935   July 31, 2011

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $1,088,282,090,
resulting in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
$56,574,185 and $40,426,967, respectively, or net unrealized
appreciation of $16,147,218.

M) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.


Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the following annual rates: 0.75% of the first $500 million
of average weekly net assets, 0.65% of the next $500 million, 0.60% of
the next $500 million and 0.55% thereafter.

Effective September 13, 2004, Putnam Investments Limited ("PIL"), an
affiliate of Putnam Management, is authorized by the Trustees to manage
a separate portion of the assets of the fund as determined by Putnam
Management from time to time. Putnam Management pays a quarterly
sub-management fee to PIL for its services at an annual rate 0.40% of
the average net assets of the portion of the fund managed by PIL.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended January 31, 2005, the
fund paid PFTC $430,587 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended January 31,
2005, the fund's expenses were reduced by $15,710 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $1,940, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund,
and an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees
receive additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of assets
and liabilities. The Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with
respect to any Trustee first elected after 2003.


Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended January 31, 2005, purchases and proceeds
from sales of investment securities other than U.S. government
securities and short-term investments aggregated $1,070,017,708 and
$1,075,493,879, respectively. Purchases and sales of U.S. government
securities aggregated no monies and $9,566,797, respectively.


Note 4
Investment in Putnam
Prime Money Market Fund

Pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC, the fund invests in Putnam
Prime Money Market Fund, an open-end management investment company managed
by Putnam Management. Management fees paid by the fund are reduced by an
amount equal to the management fees paid by Putnam Prime Money Market Fund
with respect to assets invested by the fund in Putnam Prime Money Market
Fund. For the period ended January 31, 2005, management fees paid were
reduced by $95,997 relating to the fund's investment in Putnam Prime Money
Market Fund. Income distributions earned by the fund are recorded as
income in the statement of operations and totaled $1,232,497 for the
period ended January 31, 2005.


Note 5
Senior loan commitments

Senior loans are purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery
basis and may be settled a month or more after the trade date; interest
income is accrued based on the terms of the securities. Senior loans can
be acquired through an agent, by assignment from another holder of the
loan, or as a participation interest in another holder's portion of the
loan. When the fund invests in a loan or participation, the fund is
subject to the risk that an intermediate participant between the fund
and the borrower will fail to meet its obligations to the fund, in
addition to the risk that the borrower under the loan may default on its
obligations.


Note 6
Merger of Putnam Master Income
Trust into the fund

On February 25, 2005 Putnam Master Income Trust transferred of all of
its assets into the fund in exchange for the shares of the fund and the
assumption by the fund of all of the liabilities of Putnam Master Income
Trust.


Note 7
Regulatory matters and litigation

Putnam Management has entered into agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division settling
charges connected with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees
and, in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities
Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.
Pursuant to these settlement agreements, Putnam Management will pay a
total of $193.5 million in penalties and restitution, with $153.5
million being paid to shareholders and the funds. The restitution amount
will be allocated to shareholders pursuant to a plan developed by an
independent consultant, with payments to shareholders currently expected
by the end of the summer.

The SEC's and Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and
related matters also serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits,
including purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam
Management and certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds.
Putnam Management will bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits.  Putnam Management believes that the
likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class action
lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the fund is
remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially affect its
ability to provide investment management services to its clients,
including the Putnam funds.
