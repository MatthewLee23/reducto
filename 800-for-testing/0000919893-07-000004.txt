                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management groups--
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                              Templeton offers investors a truly global
                              perspective.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                              it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                              arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to different investment approaches,
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                              typically have distinct portfolios. That's why our
                              funds can be used to build truly diversified
                              allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                              that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                              names in financial services.

Important Notice to Shareholders

REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was
originally implemented in October 1997. The Fund's Board of Directors had
discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Templeton Dragon Fund covers the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative total returns of +49.56% in market price
terms and +35.27% in net asset value terms for the year under review. You can
find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2006 was robust at 10.7%. 1
However, accelerating growth and concerns of overheating led the government to
implement policies to discourage overinvestment in certain economic sectors.
China's efforts began to show results in the latter part of the year, reflected
in moderating major economic data. In addition, China and India signed a series
of agreements in November that included energy cooperation and cultural
exchange. In the area of trade, the countries announced plans to double
bilateral trade to US$40 billion by 2010.

The Taiwanese economy grew 5.0% in third quarter 2006 compared with third
quarter 2005 (year-over-year) as strong exports compensated for weak domestic
consumption. 2 The government forecasts full-year GDP to grow 4.4% in 2006 and
4.1% in 2007. 2 Despite the robust growth, inflationary pressures remained
benign with CPI increasing 0.2% in November. 2

2 | Annual Report

<PAGE>

Hong Kong's economic recovery accelerated in 2006 with quarterly year-over-year
GDP growth rising from 5.5% in the second quarter to 6.8% in the third quarter.
1 Stronger exports and healthy private consumption were key drivers. We believe
the retail sector could benefit after the government dropped an unpopular
general sales tax (GST) proposal. Unemployment maintained a downward trend, and
declined to 4.4% as of the end of November. 1

Chinese equities were among the top-performing investments in the emerging
markets asset class during the year under review. China's rapid economic growth
coupled with the government's accelerated efforts on corporate reforms resulted
in significant fund inflows that pushed Chinese equity markets to a record high
in December. Robust investment, export and consumer demand, and high commodity
prices further supported performance.

With returns of about 30%, Hong Kong stocks, as measured by the Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) Hong Kong Index, performed in line with their
emerging markets counterparts, as strong investor interest in China-related
shares boosted the Hong Kong market to a record high. 3 Signs of an easing U.S.
monetary policy led Hong Kong interest rates to stabilize during the year, which
boosted retail sales and the luxury property market, thus benefiting corporate
earnings and further supporting stock prices. Despite double-digit returns, the
Taiwanese market lagged the Chinese and Hong Kong markets in 2006. Political
instability resulting from corruption allegations against the president and his
family members seemed to keep investors on the sidelines.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

For the year under review, the Fund's overweighted positions and stock selection
in the energy and telecommunication services sectors were among the largest
contributors to performance relative to the MSCI Golden Dragon Index. 4 Energy
stocks that had the greatest impact included China Petroleum and Chemical
Corporation (Sinopec), one of China's largest integrated energy companies; and
PetroChina, a dominant player in the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry. Overweighted positions in China Mobile and China Telecom
led the positive contribution made by the telecommunications industry. High oil
prices and China's growing energy needs continue to benefit corporate earnings
in energy-related stocks. Moreover, China's growing use of telecommunication
services has improved the sector's outlook while adoption of new technologies
such as the implementation of 3G is expected to bring forth industry
restructuring and thus unlock hidden value.

Underweighted positions in the semiconductors and semiconductor equipment
industry, and the technology hardware and equipment industry, and stock
selection in the capital goods industry further supported relative performance.
5 The Fund's overweighted position in China International Marine Containers was
the greatest contributor to performance in the capital goods sector. The Fund's
lack of exposure to Mediatek and Chi Mei Optoelectronics and an underweighted
position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing benefited relative performance as
these stocks underperformed the indexes during the reporting period.

In contrast, the Fund's exposure to the food and staples retailing industry,
with our single position in Dairy Farm International Holdings, which is not in
the MSCI Golden Dragon Index, had the largest negative impact on relative
performance because the stock recorded a decline during the period. Dairy Farm
operates supermarkets, drug stores, convenience stores and restaurants in Asia.
Consistent with our long-term view, we continued to include the stock in the
portfolio because the company continues to benefit from growing consumer demands
in Asia. The stock has contributed to the Fund's long-term performance since we
initially bought it in 1994.

4.    Source: Standard & Poor's Micropal. The MSCI Golden Dragon Index is an
      aggregate of the MSCI Hong Kong Index, the MSCI China Free Index and the
      MSCI Taiwan@65% Index. The MSCI Taiwan Index has an inclusion weight at
      65% of its market capitalization in the MSCI index series. For the 12
      months ended December 31, 2006, the MSCI Golden Dragon Index had a +39.50%
      total return.

5.    The technology hardware and equipment industry comprises communications
      equipment, computers and peripherals, electronic equipment and
      instruments, and office electronics in the SOI. The capital goods industry
      comprises construction and engineering, electrical equipment, industrial
      conglomerates, and machinery in the SOI.

The Fund's underweighted positions in insurance and diversified financial
companies also had an adverse impact on relative performance. This was mainly
because the Fund had an underweighted position in China Life Insurance, the
principal life insurance company in China, and no exposure to Hong Kong
Exchanges & Clearing, owner and operator of Hong Kong's stock and futures
exchange. Both stocks significantly outperformed the indexes. We did not own
these because we considered their valuations expensive.

During the reporting period, the Fund increased its exposure to China "H"
shares. Key purchases included major commercial banks Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China and Bank of China; China Shenhua Energy, an integrated coal-based
energy company that is also China's largest coal producer; and China Telecom,
the country's leading integrated telecommunications services provider. We
believe ongoing restructuring efforts in the Chinese banking and
telecommunications sectors could unlock hidden value in companies in these
sectors. Moreover, China's growing energy demand and high coal prices should
support corporate earnings in the coal, oil and gas sectors. Another key
purchase in the energy sector was CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil and
natural gas exploration and production company.

Conversely, the Fund reduced its exposure to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Major sales
included Hang Lung Group, a Hong Kong real estate company; Delta Electronics, a
major Taiwanese electronic equipment manufacturer; and Hongkong and Shanghai
Hotels, the owner and operator of eight hotels, including Hong Kong's Peninsula
Hotel. The Fund also reduced its position in certain stocks by realizing gains
during the period. These sales subsequently reduced the Fund's holdings in the
real estate management and development, wireless telecommunication services and
hotels sectors.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements
following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of
country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository
Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements
are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market
proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred. If such an event
occurs, the securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may
include the use of independent pricing services. All security valuation
procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund intends to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.


                                                              Annual Report | 17

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign
securities are recognized as soon as the Fund is notified of the ex-dividend
date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

At December 31, 2006, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par
value). During the year ended December 31, 2006 and the year ended December 31,
2005, there were no share transactions; all reinvested distributions were
satisfied with previously issued shares purchased in the open market.

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Under the program,
the Fund may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, there were no share repurchases.

4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of

5. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, was as follows:

                                       -------------------------
                                           2006          2005
                                       -------------------------
Distributions paid from:
   Ordinary income .................   $19,999,276   $18,394,047
   Long term capital gain ..........    68,858,697    10,579,409
                                       -------------------------
                                       $88,857,973   $28,973,456
                                       =========================

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions and passive foreign
investment company shares.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, and passive foreign investment company shares.

At December 31, 2006, the cost of investments, net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation), undistributed ordinary income and undistributed long term
capital gains for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments ...............................   $ 569,735,913
                                                      =============

an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees paid by the Sweep
Money Fund.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. REORGANIZATION TO A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares ("marketing support"), Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"),
entered into settlements with certain of those regulators. Specifically, the
Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among others, concerning market
timing and marketing support.

On June 23, 2006, the SEC approved the proposed plan of distribution for the
marketing support settlement, and disbursement of the settlement monies to the
designated funds, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that settlement
and plan, was completed in September 2006. The Fund did not participate in that
Settlement.

The plan of distribution for the market timing settlement is currently under
review by the SEC staff. After publication of notice of the plan and a 30-day
comment period, the proposed plan of distribution will be submitted to the SEC
for approval. Following the SEC's approval of the plan of distribution, with
modifications as appropriate, distribution of the settlement monies will begin
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement and plan.

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above, as well as to allegedly excessive commissions and
advisory and distribution fees.


                                                              Annual Report | 21

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

11. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition,
classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the
related interest and penalties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006, and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
date of effectiveness. On December 22, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission extended the implementation date to no later than the last net asset
value calculation in the first semi-annual reporting period in 2007. The Fund is
currently evaluating the impact, if any, of applying the various provisions of
FIN 48.

In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement"
("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Fund believes the adoption of SFAS 157
will have no material impact on its financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2006, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2006 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan, unless he elects to withdraw.
Shareholders holding their shares through Japan Securities Depository Center,
Inc., will not be enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and
they elect to participate. If shares are registered in the name of a
broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the broker-dealer or
nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the shareholder's behalf unless
the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless the reinvestment service is
not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for a
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attention:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares on the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Under Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $92,708,488 as a long
term capital gain dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

Under Section 871(k)(2)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $6,852,371 as a short term capital gain dividend for
purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of the Code for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $5,176,526 as qualified dividends for purposes of the
maximum rate under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006. In January 2007, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV
which will include their share of qualified dividends distributed during the
calendar year 2006. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors
for information on the treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax
returns.

Under Section 871(k)(1)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $1,467,787 as interest related dividends for purposes

ended December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2006, more than 50% of the Fund's total assets were invested in
securities of foreign issuers. In most instances, foreign taxes were withheld
from dividends paid to the Fund on these investments. As shown in the table
below, the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign source income and foreign
taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This designation will allow
shareholders of record on December 29, 2006, to treat their proportionate share
of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid directly by them. The
shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year
in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by
the Fund, to shareholders of record.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Tax Paid per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or, as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income. 1

Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. 1

In January 2007, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2006. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2006 individual income
tax returns.

1     Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in
      the 10% and 15% income tax brackets). In determining the amount of foreign
      tax credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of
      individuals receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may
      be required to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect
      the rate differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules
      however permit certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate
      differential adjustments for capital gains and/or dividends for any
      taxable year. Please consult your tax advisor and the instructions to Form
      1116 for more information.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.   N/A


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Limited in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies
and Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
will refer the matter, along with the recommended course of action by the
manager to an interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include
portfolio managers and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for
evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the
voting recommendation of ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third
party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with a
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. Where the Proxy Review Committee
refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board of directors or a committee of the
board.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the ISS quantitative model utilized to assess such plans
and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by

proxy voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on
the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV and reflect the 12-month period beginning July 1,
2005, and ending June 30, 2006.

</TABLE>
1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         a Franklin Templeton fund which vest over a three-year period (17.5% to
         25%) and other mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%). The deferred
         equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested interest of the
         portfolio manager in the financial performance of both Franklin
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

         o    INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to
              the historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         o    NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative
              contributions of a portfolio manager to the manager's business and
              the investment management team, including business knowledge,
              contribution to team efforts, mentoring of junior staff, and
              contribution to the marketing of the Fund, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         o    RESEARCH. Where the portfolio management team also has
              research responsibilities, each portfolio manager is evaluated on
              the number and performance of recommendations over time.

         o    RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of
              funds managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the
              manager's appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds,
         and options to purchase common shares of a Franklin Templeton fund.
         Awards of such deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over
         time, so as to create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager as of December 31, 2006 (such amounts may change from
time to time):

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered

relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
