and economic  changes,  and market risks. This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   July 22, 2005

Dear Shareholders,

      In the  first  half of the year  (2005),  global  markets  struggled  with
concerns  over  the  rising  price  of oil and its  impact  on  demand.  Markets
succumbed to the pressure in April caused by concerns of slowing economic growth
in the United  States.  Global  markets dipped lower again in June when oil rose
above $60 per barrel,  but recovered when prices moderated to $57 per barrel. In
Europe,  markets  were  impacted by political  uncertainty,  with the French and
Dutch rejecting the European Union constitution at the end of May.  Nonetheless,
European  markets  performed  relatively  well. The  announcement  of Chancellor
Schroder  calling  for early  polls in Germany  was the main  driver  behind the
German  market's strong  performance in the second quarter.  After a weak April,
the DAX index  rallied  during the rest of the period to its highest level since
July 2002,  decoupling  from the negative  impact of rising oil prices.(1)  Even
though stocks have rallied since the start of the year,  the German stock market
continues to trade at a discount to its European peers.

      As in  the  first  quarter,  takeover  rumors  and  actual  takeover  bids
supported  performance  of German  small and mid caps.  As a result,  the Midcap
Market  Performance Index (the fund's benchmark) reached its highest level since
the end of boom year 2000.(2)

      For the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  the total  return  based on net
asset  value of The New  Germany  Fund was 3.68% and the total  return  based on
market  price  was  4.58%,  while  the  fund's  benchmark,   the  Midcap  Market
Performance  Index,  returned 2.08% in US dollar terms.  (Past performance is no
guarantee of future  results.  Please see page 2, for more complete  performance
information.)

      The fund benefited from its position in Solarworld, initiated in the first
quarter.  Solarworld  was  once  more the top  performer  of the  Midcap  Market
Performance  Index during the second quarter  despite fears that early elections
may trigger regulatory changes for renewable energy sources.  The share price of
the  company  increased  by more than 40% in US dollar  terms  (and up 95% in US
dollar terms in the first six months of 2005). The share price strength was used
to  realize  profits  and  the  fund  has  since  reduced  its  position.  Stada
Arzneimittel  also contributed  positively to the fund's overall  performance as
the stock  rose due to  takeover  speculation.  Over the  course  of the  second
quarter, the fund increased its position in the information technology sector by
initiating  positions in Software AG and Utimaco Safeware.  Software AG develops
computer software and offers database management software.  The company released
strong financial  figures,  and the fund's  investment  management team believes
that the growth  potential  of the  company  has not yet been  discounted.  Poor
performance of the fund's long-term  holdings in Funkwerk and Kontron  detracted
from the fund's performance. The fund was also negatively affected by not owning
shares of  KarstadtQuelle,  whose share price was driven by ongoing  speculation
about a breakup or going  private  rather than  fundamentals.  The fund kept its
cautious approach,  which was underpinned by the profit warning that the company
issued in the middle of July.

      The strong recent performance of smaller and medium-sized  companies could
provide for a more difficult general investment environment.  The fund therefore
emphasized  its  focus  on  stock  selection.   Earnings   growth,   merger  and
acquisition,  and increasing venture capital activities should remain supporting
factors for this  universe.  The early  elections in September  could see rising
interest  among  international  investors and also for German small- and mid-cap
companies.

      The New Germany Fund  continued its  open-market  purchases of its shares,
buying 370,400 shares during the first six months of 2005.* The fund's  discount
to its net asset value averaged 13.87% during this period.

Investments in funds involve risk including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified  and primarily  focuses its investments in Germany,
thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country.  Investing
in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic
investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and
market risks. This may result in greater share price volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund.  Therefore,  the Fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares  will trade at,  below or above net asset  value.  Closed-end
funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.  There is a one-time
public  offering,  and once issued,  shares of closed-end  funds are sold in the
open market through a stock exchange.

The  Fund  has  elected  to  not  be  subject  to  the  statutory   calculation,
notification  and  publication  requirements  of the German  Investment  Tax Act
(Investmentsteuergesetz).  As a  result  German  investors  in the  Fund  may be
subject to less favorable lump-sum taxation under German law.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      QUESTION:  THIS PAST  SPRING,  FRANCE AND THE  NETHERLANDS  REJECTED A NEW
CONSTITUTION FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHAT ARE THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
FUTURE OF THE EU? IS THIS A SIGN THAT MONETARY UNION IS NOT WORKING?

      ANSWER:  While the "no" vote is a setback for the EU, it does not have any
immediate  implications for the German market. Member countries remain committed
to monetary union,  and the EU will continue to be governed by the  constitution
that was in place  before  the vote  this  spring.  Perhaps  the most  important
consequence of the  constitutional  defeat is that  enlargement of the 25-member
union is likely to pause  until the  current  members  get their house in order.
This may be  marginally  positive for Germany as a net payer to the EU. In terms
of monetary  union,  the  failure of recent EU  budgetary  negotiations  has put
pressure  on the euro and could  result in delays to  planned  expansion  of the
Eurozone.

      QUESTION:  GERMAN  ELECTIONS THAT WERE SCHEDULED FOR 2006 HAVE BEEN CALLED
EARLY FOR SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GERMAN MARKET?

      ANSWER:  At the  beginning of July,  Chancellor  Schroeder  requested  and
received a vote of no confidence from the Bundestag  (lower house) to call early
elections.  In mid-September  they are expected to bring increased  momentum for
reforms.  Schroeder  has had  difficulty  implementing  some of the Agenda  2010
reforms due to lack of support within his coalition. Depending on the outcome of
the elections,  a broad CDU/FDP coalition (CDU:  Christich-Demokratische  Union;
FDP:  Frele  Demokratische  Partei)  with  majority  control  in both  houses of
parliament could be established, giving the government power to forge ahead with
labor market,  tax, and health care reforms.  In terms of the stock market,  the
DAX  has  historically  performed  well in  election  years,  outperforming  its
European peers by more than 20%(1).  Given that many of the reforms would have a
favorable impact on German  companies,  it is expected that the DAX would follow
this  historical  trend. Of course,  past  performance is no guarantee of future
results.

      QUESTION:  GERMAN  SHARES  HAVE  PERFORMED  WELL  DESPITE  AN  UNFAVORABLE
DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT. ASIDE FROM THEIR FOCUS ON EXPORT MARKETS, WHAT HAVE GERMAN
COMPANIES  BEEN DOING TO  ACHIEVE  SUCH  STRONG  PERFORMANCE  RELATIVE  TO THEIR
EUROPEAN PEERS?

      ANSWER:  Developing a global market for their products has been one of the
most  effective  strategies  for German  companies  to remain  profitable  in an
environment of weak domestic consumption.  However,  German businesses recognize
the importance of remaining  competitive on the production  side as well. One of
the most significant costs for German companies is labor. Because the government
was slow to implement labor reforms,  several German companies took matters into
their  own  hands  and  successfully  bargained  with  labor  unions,   securing
agreements for employees to work longer hours at the same pay.  Other  companies
built production  facilities overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and
tax rates,  a strategy that worked well with the  development  of global markets
for their products.  Now that the outgoing government's reform program looks set
for better speed,  German companies operating primarily in Germany are likely to
be the main beneficiaries.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

      The first half of the year (2005) brought a series of ups and downs on the
economic front. Business confidence,  as measured by the ZEW index, and consumer
confidence,  as  measured  by the IFO  index,  both  fell in May (the IFO  index
reached a 20-month low) before  rebounding  in June.  Meanwhile  gross  domestic
product (GDP) grew by 1%  quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter of 2005, the
fastest rate since 2001. In the face of weak domestic  demand,  growth continues
to be driven by net exports.  This trend should  continue,  as the euro weakened
steadily throughout the second quarter,  making German products more competitive
overseas.  Unemployment peaked at 12% during the first quarter and remained well
above 11%  throughout  the half.  As expected,  the  European  Central Bank kept
interest rates unchanged at 2%.

      For the second  half of the year,  the early  elections  in Germany can be
expected to affect the economic  environment,  as  uncertainty  surrounding  the
future of government  reforms will likely stifle  domestic  demand.  A potential
increase in the VAT rate could hinder private consumption, which would limit GDP
growth  through the end of the year.  Once a new  government is in place and the
reform  program is  announced,  demand could pick up again as  consumers  regain
confidence  about the future.  Overall,  we expect  modest GDP growth of 1.0% in
2005.  Investment may also be constrained until German companies gain clarity on
the direction of future reforms, but inflation should remain low and is forecast
to be 1.6% in 2005.  From a fiscal  perspective,  the new  government's  biggest
challenge  will be financing the reforms,  as the budget  deficit is expected to
decrease only slightly from last year,  from 3.7% of GDP to 3.6%.  However,  the
prospects  for  German  growth  should  improve  significantly  in  2006  as the
structural reforms that have been set in motion begin to gain traction.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

      The  observations  in this letter  reflect our own opinions as of July 22,
2005 and are based on our own analysis,  and others may have different opinions.
Events may not transpire as we or they currently  expect.  Also,  while economic
events can influence broad market trends, political,  monetary and other factors
are also relevant to stock  performance.  In any event,  investment results will
depend on our success in identifying  individual stocks, which are influenced by
many factors  beyond general  economic  matters.  We cannot  predict  investment
results or whether they will be successful.

THE NEW GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The New Germany Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on January
16, 1990 as a non-diversified,  closed-end  management  investment company.  The
Fund  commenced  investment  operations on January 30, 1990.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

SECURITIES LENDING: The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions.  The
Fund retains beneficial  ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues
to receive  interest and dividends  paid by the securities and to participate in
any changes in their  market  value.  The Fund  requires  the  borrowers  of the
securities  to  maintain   collateral   with  the  Fund  consisting  of  liquid,
unencumbered assets having a value at least equal to the value of the securities
loaned.  The Fund may invest the cash collateral into a joint trading account in
an affiliated  money market fund pursuant to Exemptive Orders issued by the SEC.
The Fund receives  compensation for lending its securities either in the form of
fees or by earning  interest on invested cash  collateral  net of fees paid to a
lending agent.  Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the loan. The Fund
is  subject  to all  investment  risks  associated  with  the  value of any cash
collateral  received,  including,  but not limited to, interest rate, credit and
liquidity risk associated with such investments.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange  prevailing on the respective  settlement  dates of such
transactions.  The  resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate
fluctuations  are identified  separately in the Statement of Operations,  except
for such amounts  attributable to investments which are included in net realized
and unrealized gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts with service providers that contain general  indemnification  clauses.
The Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown as this would
involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been
made.  However,  based on  experience,  the Fund  expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

THE NEW GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL--JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

The Fund had a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager").  At its July 12, 2004 Board meeting, the Board approved transferring
the Fund's  Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  to an
affiliated company,  Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. The transfer,
which became effective  September 1, 2004, did not involve any change in control
or actual management of the investment manager, which provides the same scope of
services, utilizes the same people for work on Fund matters and charges the same
fees under the  agreement.  The Fund has an Investment  Advisory  Agreement with
Deutsche Asset Management  International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The
Manager and the Investment Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100 million,  .55% of such assets in excess of $100 million and up
to $500  million,  and  .50% of such  assets  in  excess  of $500  million.  The
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  the  Investment  Adviser  with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million.  Accordingly,  for the period ended June 30, 2005, the combined
fee pursuant to the Management and Investment Advisory Agreements was equivalent
to an annualized effective rate of .87% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders and  selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions  on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

For the period ended June 30, 2005,  Deutsche  Bank AG, the German parent of the
Manager and Investment Adviser, and its affiliates received $64,316 in brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Fund,  that the board  determined  were  effected in compliance
with the Fund's Rule 17e-1 procedures.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee  meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for  the  period  ended  June  30,  2005,  were   $58,682,771  and  $69,334,408,
respectively.

The cost of  investments  at June 30, 2005 was  $219,425,703  for United  States
Federal  income tax purposes.  Accordingly,  as of June 30, 2005, net unrealized
appreciation of investments  aggregated  $86,232,624,  of which  $88,234,220 and
$2,001,596  related to unrealized  appreciation and depreciation,  respectively.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at December 31, 2004 of approximately $172,136,000, of which $83,896,000
and  $88,240,000  will expire in 2009 and 2010,  respectively.  No capital gains
distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders  until future net gains have
been realized in excess of such carry forward.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

On June 30, 2005, the market value of the  securities  loaned and its collateral
were  $44,104,785 and $46,362,180,  respectively.  For the period ended June 30,
2005,  the Fund earned  $321,960 as  securities  lending  fees,  net of borrower
rebates and agency fees.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL

During the period ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended  December 31, 2004, the
Fund  purchased  370,400 and 1,245,300 of its shares of common stock on the open
market at a total cost of $3,405,787 and $9,625,399,  respectively. The weighted
average  discount of these purchased shares comparing the purchased price to the
net asset value at the time of purchase was 13.6% and 16.9%, respectively. These
shares are held in treasury.

The Fund offers  stockholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:

                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating

                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

(b)               Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                  caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
                  designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable

                  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

                  filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and

(d)               Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

5.                The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
                  disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
                  of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
                  the equivalent functions):

(a)               All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial

                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

(b)               Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the

                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely

                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

(b)               Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
