Chairman's
Letter to Shareholders

[PHOTO OF ROBERT P. BREMNER]

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

The financial markets in which your Fund operates continue to reflect the larger
economic crosscurrents. The illiquidity that infected global credit markets over
the last year continues to recede but there is concern about the impact of a
reduction in official liquidity support programs. The major institutions that
are the linchpin of the international financial system have strengthened their
capital structures, but many still struggle with losses in their various
portfolios. Global trends include increasing trade and concern about the ability
of the U.S. government to address its substantial budgetary deficits.

While the fixed-income and equity markets have recovered from the lows recorded
in the first quarter of 2009, identifying those developments that will define
the future is never easy, and rarely is it more difficult than at present. A
fundamental component of a successful investment program is a commitment to
remain focused on long-term investment goals even during periods of heightened
market uncertainty. Another component is to re-evaluate investment disciplines
and tactics and to confirm their validity following periods of extreme
volatility and market dislocation, such as we have recently experienced. Your
Board carried out an intensive review of investment performance with these
objectives in mind during April and May of 2009 as part of the annual management
contract renewal process. I encourage you to read the description of this
process in the Annual Investment Management Agreement Approval Process section
of this report. Confirming the appropriateness of a long term investment
strategy is as important for our shareholders as it is for our professional
investment managers. For that reason, I again encourage you to remain in
communication with your financial consultant on this subject.

In September 2009, Nuveen completed the refinancing at par of all the auction
rate preferred shares issued by its taxable closed-end funds. On October 15,
Nuveen announced the first successful offering of an issue of MuniFund Term
Preferred Shares. This new form of preferred securities joins the Variable Rate
Demand Preferred securities as vehicles for refinancing existing municipal fund
auction rate preferred shares (ARPS). By the beginning of December 2009, six of
the leveraged municipal closed-end funds had redeemed all of their outstanding
ARPS. Nuveen remains committed to resolving the issues connected with
outstanding auction rate preferred shares. Please consult the Nuveen web site
for the most recent information on this issue and all recent developments on
your Nuveen Funds at: www.nuveen.com.

On behalf of the other members of your Fund's Board, we look forward to
continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE
TWELVE-MONTH REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2009?

During this reporting period, municipal bond prices generally rose as strong
cash flows into municipal bond funds combined with tighter supply of new
tax-exempt issuance to provide favorable supply and demand conditions. As the
period began, there continued to be considerable downward pressure on the
economy. In an effort to improve conditions, the Federal Reserve (Fed) lowered
the fed funds rate to a target range of zero to 0.25% in December 2008, the
lowest level on record. In February 2009, the federal government augmented its
efforts to boost the economy by passing a $787 billion stimulus package, which
joined the $700 billion financial industry rescue package it had passed in late
2008. In March 2009, the Fed announced that, in addition to maintaining the
current rate, it would buy $300 billion in long-term Treasury securities in an
effort to support private credit markets and up to an additional $750 billion in
agency mortgage-backed securities to bolster the credit and housing markets.

In recent months, the measures taken by the Fed and others to ease the economic
recession have produced some incipient signs of improvement. In the third
quarter of 2009, the U.S. economy, as measured by the U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP) posted positive growth (2.8% annualized) for the first time since
the second quarter of 2008. Housing prices also provided a bright spot between
June and September 2009 by recording four consecutive months of positive
returns, the first following three years of decline. At the same time, inflation
remained muted, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), reflecting a 14% drop in
energy prices, fell 0.2% year-over-year as of October 2009. This marked the
seventh straight month that consumer prices dropped from their levels of a year
earlier, the longest such decline since 1954-1955. The core CPI (which excludes

food and energy) rose 1.7% over the year, within the Fed's unofficial objective
of 2.0% or lower for this measure. However, the economy continued to be stressed
by weakness in the labor markets. October 2009 marked the 22nd consecutive month
of net job losses, with a total of 7.3 million jobs lost since the recession
began in December 2007. This is the biggest decline since the Great Depression.
The national unemployment rate for October 2009 was 10.2%, a 26-year high, up
from 6.6% in October 2008.

Municipal market conditions began to show general signs of improvement in
mid-December 2008 and municipal bonds continued to improve throughout most of
2009. This trend was bolstered by the reduced supply of tax-exempt municipal
debt in the marketplace, due in part to the introduction of the Build America
Bond program in April 2009. Build America Bonds are a new class of taxable
municipal debt created as part of the February 2009 economic stimulus package.
These bonds offer municipal issuers a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the
security's interest payments, and therefore provide issuers with an attractive
alternative to traditional tax-exempt debt. As of October 31, 2009, taxable
Build America Bonds issuance totaled $48.5 billion, accounting for almost 20% of
new bonds issued in the municipal market during the period since their
introduction.

Over the twelve months ended October 31, 2009, tax-exempt municipal bond
issuance nationwide totaled $404.5 billion, a drop of approximately 10% compared
with the twelve-month period ended October 31, 2008. As mentioned earlier,
demand for tax-exempt bonds was strong, especially on the part of individual
investors and broker/dealers. The combination of lower tax-exempt supply and
increased demand provided support for municipal bond prices.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THIS REPORTING
PERIOD?

During the majority of this twelve-month period, the tax-exempt municipal bond
market was characterized by strong demand, constrained supply of new tax-exempt
bonds and generally improving valuations.

In this environment, our trading activity continued to focus on finding relative
value by taking a bottom-up approach to discover undervalued sectors and
individual credits with the potential to perform well over the long term. In
NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NXZ, we generally were purchasing investment-grade
quality bonds offering good call protection. Many of the additions to the
portfolios were in the health care sector, primarily bonds rated AA, A or BBB.
While the overall supply of new tax-exempt bonds declined, supply was more
plentiful in the health care sector because hospitals generally do not qualify
for the Build America Bond program and so must continue to issue bonds in the
tax-exempt municipal market. In addition, many hospitals were issuing fixed rate
bonds during this period in order to refinance and retire outstanding debt that
had initially been issued as variable rate debt.

In NZF, our focus was on purchasing bonds with longer maturities in two
categories: essential services and health care. In essential services, our
purchases included bonds backing water and sewer projects, utilities, schools
and roads. We also bought bonds in the health care sector, most of which were
rated AA or A.

                                                            Nuveen Investments 3

<PAGE>

Cash for new purchases during this period was generated largely by maturing or
called bonds. NZF also sold some bonds with shorter maturities, including
pre-refunded holdings. While there was considerable issuance of Build America
Bonds over the last half of this period, these bonds do not represent good
investment opportunities for all these Funds because their interest payments are
considered taxable income.

All of these Funds continued to use inverse floating rate securities.(1) as a
form of leverage for a variety of reasons, including duration management, income
enhancement and total return enhancements. During the first part of the period,
NZF also invested in additional types of derivative instruments(2) designed to
help lengthen its duration. These derivatives were removed before the end of the
reporting period.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2009, the total returns on common share
net asset value (NAV) for all six of these Funds exceeded the returns for the
Standard & Poor's (S&P) National Municipal Bond Index. All of the Funds
underperformed the Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds Average.

Key management factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this period
included yield curve and duration positioning, credit exposure and sector
allocation. In addition, leverage was an important positive factor affecting the
Funds' performances over this period. The impact of leverage is discussed in
more detail on page six.

      Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance
      may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns do not reflect the
      deduction of taxes that shareholders may have to pay on Fund distributions
      or upon the sale of Fund shares.

(1)   An inverse floating rate security, also known as an inverse floater, is a
      financial instrument designed to pay long-term tax-exempt interest at a
      rate that varies inversely with a short-term tax-exempt interest rate
      index. For the Nuveen Funds, the index typically used is the Securities
      Industry and Financial Markets (SIFM) Municipal Swap Index (previously
      referred to as the Bond Market Association Index or BMA). Inverse
      floaters, including those inverse floating rate securities in which the
      Funds invested during this reporting period, are further defined within
      the Notes to Financial Statements and Glossary of Terms Used in this
      Report sections of this report.

(2)   Each Fund may invest in derivative instruments such as forwards, futures,
      options and swap transactions. For additional information on the
      derivative instruments in which each Fund was invested during and at the
      end of the reporting period, see the Portfolio of Investments, Financial
      Statements and Notes to Financial Statements sections of this report.

(3)   The Standard & Poor's (S&P) National Municipal Bond Index is an
      unleveraged, market value-weighted index designed to measure the
      performance of the investment-grade U.S. municipal bond market. This index
      does not reflect any initial or ongoing expenses and is not available for
      direct investment.

(4)   The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds Average is calculated
      using the returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period
      as follows: 1-year, 54 funds; 5-year, 52 funds; and 10-year, 38 funds.
      Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of dividends. You cannot
      invest directly in a Lipper Average.

During this period, yields on tax-exempt bonds generally declined and bond
prices rose, especially at the longer end of the municipal yield curve. As a
result, longer-term bonds generally outperformed credits with shorter
maturities. In general, the greater a Fund's exposure to the longer part of the
yield curve, the greater the positive impact on the Fund's return. Among these
six Funds, NAD benefited from being the most heavily weighted in the longer part
of the curve, while NMO's duration was slightly short of our target, which
hampered its performance.

As mentioned earlier, our duration strategies in NZF included using derivative
positions during the first part of this period to synthetically extend its
duration. These derivative positions performed well and had a positive impact on
NZF's total return performance.

While yield curve positioning and duration played important roles in
performance, credit exposure was also a significant factor. As noted earlier,
demand for municipal bonds increased among both institutional and individual
investors during this period. This increase was driven by a variety of factors,
including concerns about potential tax increases, the need to rebalance
portfolio allocations and a growing appetite for additional risk. At the same
time, the supply of new tax-exempt municipal securities declined. As investors
bid up municipal bond prices, bonds rated BBB or below and non-rated bonds
generally outperformed those rated AAA. In this environment, allocations of
bonds rated BBB or below and non-rated bonds generally made positive relative
contributions to the Funds' performances.

Holdings that generally contributed positively to the Funds' performances
included industrial development revenue (IDR), housing and health care bonds, as
well as education, water and sewer, transportation and special tax bonds. Zero
coupon bonds and credits backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement agreement
also posted strong returns.

Pre-refunded bonds, which are often backed by U.S. Treasury securities and which
had been one of the top performing segments of the municipal bond market over
the past two years, performed especially poorly during this period. This
underperformance can be attributed primarily to these bonds' shorter effective
maturities and higher credit quality. As of October 31, 2009, NXZ and NMO had
the heaviest weightings in pre-refunded bonds, while NAD had the smallest. Other
market segments that detracted from relative performance included resource
recovery, leasing and electric utility bonds. These were the only three revenue
sectors that failed to outperform the overall municipal market during this
period. Many general obligation bonds also failed to keep pace with the overall
municipal market.

All six Funds' returns were negatively impacted to varying degrees by their
holdings of AMBAC-Insured bonds issued for the Las Vegas monorail project, that
links various casinos on the Las Vegas strip. The project has struggled to build
ridership and turn a profit, and proposals to extend the monorail to McCarran
International Airport remained on hold.

IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

One important factor impacting the returns of these Funds relative to the
comparative index was the Funds' use of financial leverage. The Funds use
leverage because their managers believe that, over time, leveraging provides
opportunities for additional income and total returns for common shareholders.
However, use of leverage also can expose common shareholders to additional
risk-- especially when market conditions are unfavorable. For example, as the
prices of securities held by a Fund decline, the negative impact of these
valuation changes on common share net asset value and common shareholder total
return is magnified by the use of leverage. Conversely, leverage may enhance
common share returns during periods when bond prices generally are rising.

Over the early part of this period, leverage hampered the performance of the
Funds using this strategy. However, leverage made a significant positive
contribution to those Funds returns over much of 2009, which can be seen in
their twelve-month performance shown on page four.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE FUNDS' LEVERAGED CAPITAL STRUCTURE

As noted in the last several shareholder reports, the auction rate preferred
shares issued by many closed-end funds, including these Nuveen Funds, have been
hampered by a lack of liquidity since February 2008. Since that time, more
auction rate preferred shares have been submitted for sale in their regularly
scheduled auctions than there have been offers to buy. In fact, offers to buy
have been almost completely non-existent since late February 2008. This means
that these auctions have "failed to clear," and that many, or all, of the
auction rate preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their shares in these
auctions were unable to do so. This lack of liquidity in auction rate preferred
shares did not lower the credit quality of these shares, and auction rate
preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the
"maximum rate" applicable to failed auctions, as calculated in accordance with
the pre-established terms of the auction rate preferred shares. In the recent
market, with short-term rates at multi-generational lows, those maximum rates
also have been low.

One continuing implication for common shareholders from the auction failures is
that each Fund's cost of leverage likely has been incrementally higher at times
than it otherwise might have been had the auctions continued to be successful.
As a result, each Fund's common share earnings likely have been incrementally
lower at times than they otherwise might have been.

As noted in past shareholder reports, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees
authorized a plan to use tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as floating rate
securities, to refinance a portion of the Funds' outstanding auction rate
preferred shares. The amount of TOBs that a Fund may use varies according to the
composition of each Fund's portfolio. Some Funds have a greater ability to use
TOBs than others. As of October 31, 2009, some Funds have issued Variable Rate
Demand Preferred Shares (VRDP), but these issuances have been limited since it
has been difficult to find liquidity facilities on economically viable terms
given the constrained credit environment. Some Funds also have issued MuniFund
Term Preferred (MTP), a fixed-rate form of preferred stock with a mandatory
redemption period of five years. However, the Funds cannot provide any assurance
on when the remaining outstanding auction rate preferred shares might be
redeemed.

As of October 31, 2009, the amount of auction rate preferred securities redeemed
by the Funds are as shown in the accompanying table.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the past shareholder reports, all of NXZ's redemptions were achieved
through the issuance of VRDP in conjunction with the proceeds from the creation
of TOBs. VRDP is a new instrument designed to replace the auction rate preferred
shares used as leverage in Nuveen closed-end funds. VRDP is offered only to
qualified institutional buyers, defined pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933. As of October 31, 2009, NXZ had issued $196 million of
VRDP.

As of October 31, 2009, 75 out of the 88 Nuveen closed-end municipal funds that
had issued auction rate preferred shares have redeemed, at par, all or a portion
of these shares. These redemptions bring the total amount of Nuveen's municipal
closed-end funds' auction rate preferred share redemptions to approximately $2.4
billion of the original $11 billion outstanding.

Common Share Dividend and Share Price Information

During the twelve-month reporting period ended October 31, 2009, NPP, NMA, NMO
and NZF each had three monthly dividend increases, NAD had two increases and NXZ
had one monthly dividend increase.

Due to normal portfolio activity, common shareholders of the following Funds
received net ordinary income distributions at the end of December 2008 as
follows:

                                                             NET ORDINARY INCOME

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2009, all of
the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances for both tax and financial
statement purposes.

(1)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

(1)   Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS
NUVEEN PERFORMANCE PLUS MUNICIPAL FUND, INC.
NUVEEN MUNICIPAL ADVANTAGE FUND, INC.
NUVEEN MUNICIPAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY FUND, INC.
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 2
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 3

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 2, and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (the "Funds")
as of October 31, 2009, and the related statements of operations and cash flows
(Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 3 only) for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2009, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2, and Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 3 at October 31, 2009, the results of their operations
and cash flows (Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen
Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 only) for the year then ended, changes in
their net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended in
conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                               Ernst & Young LLP

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc. (NPP), Nuveen
Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD), Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3
(NZF) (collectively, the "Funds"). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage
(NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend
Advantage 3 (NZF) are traded on the NYSE Amex. The Funds are registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, management
investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a portfolio of municipal obligations issued by state
and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification(TM) (the "Codification") as the single
source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The Codification supersedes existing
non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. The Codification
did not change GAAP but rather organized it into a hierarchy where all guidance
within the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification
became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods
ending after September 15, 2009. The Codification did not have a material effect
on the Funds' financial statements.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with US
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

Exchange-listed securities are generally valued at the last sales price on the
securities exchange on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities
traded on a securities exchange for which there are no transactions on a given
day or securities are not listed on a securities exchange are valued at the mean
of the closing bid and asked prices. Securities traded on NASDAQ are valued at
the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's
investment portfolio are provided by a pricing service approved by the Fund's
Board of Directors/Trustees. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided
by an independent pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of
Directors/Trustees. Futures contracts are valued using the closing settlement
price, or, in the absence of such a price, at the mean of the bid and asked
prices. When market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the
case for municipal securities), the pricing service or, in the absence of a
pricing service for a particular investment or derivative instrument, the Board
of Directors/Trustees of the Fund, or its designee, may establish fair value
using a wide variety of market data including yields or prices of investments of
comparable quality, type of issue, coupon, maturity and rating, market quotes or
indications of value from security dealers, evaluations of anticipated cash
flows or collateral, general market conditions and other information and
analysis, including the obligor's credit characteristics considered relevant.
Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate and demand features
qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates value.

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2009,
Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and
Dividend Advantage (NAD) had outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery purchase
commitments of $6,408,325, $19,528,605, $17,477,313 and $7,274,876,
respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the
other Funds.

Investment Income

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividend income is recorded
on the ex-dividend date when information is available. Interest income, which
includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for financial
reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis. Investment income also
includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain
such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. Net
realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by the Funds are
subject to federal taxation.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions, management of the
Funds has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that
would require recognition in the financial statements. Open tax years are those
that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the last
four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). Furthermore,
management of the Funds is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from US
generally accepted accounting principles.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares

The following Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares,
$25,000 stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each
Fund's Auction Rate Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The
dividend rate paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days,
pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is
payable at the end of each rate period. As of October 31, 2009, the number of
Auction Rate Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund
is as follows:

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the Auction Rate Preferred shares issued by the Funds
than there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear,"
and that many Auction Rate Preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their
shares in these auctions were unable to do so. Auction Rate Preferred
shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the "maximum
rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with the
pre-established terms of the Auction Rate Preferred shares.

These developments have generally not affected the management or investment
policies of the Funds. However, one continuing implication of these auction
failures for Common shareholders is that the Funds' cost of leverage likely has
been incrementally higher at times, than it otherwise would have been had the
auctions continued to be successful. As a result, the Funds' future Common share
earnings may likely have been incrementally lower than they otherwise would have
been. As of October 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of outstanding Auction Rate
Preferred shares redeemed by each Fund is as follows:

Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares

On August 7, 2008, Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) issued 1,960 Series 1 Variable
Rate Demand Preferred shares, $100,000 liquidation value per share, in a
privately negotiated offering. Proceeds of this offering along with the proceeds
from the Fund's creation of tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as "floaters"
or floating rate obligations, were used to redeem all of the Fund's outstanding
Auction Rate Preferred shares totaling $222,000,000. The Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shares were offered to institutional buyers as defined pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, have a maturity date of August 1,
2038 and include a liquidity feature that allows the Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shareholders to have their shares purchased by the liquidity provider
in the event that sell orders are not matched with purchase orders in a
remarketing. Dividends on the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares (which are
treated as interest payments for financial reporting purposes) are set weekly at
a rate established by a remarketing agent; therefore, the liquidation value of
the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares approximates fair value.

Subject to certain conditions, Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares may be
redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund
may also redeem certain of the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares if the Fund
fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements and such failures are not
cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption price per share is equal to
the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any accumulated but unpaid
dividends.

Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) had all $196,000,000 of its Variable Rate Demand
Preferred shares outstanding during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, with
an annualized interest rate of .73%.

For financial reporting purposes only, the liquidation value of Variable Rate
Demand Preferred shares is recorded as a liability on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities and the dividends paid on the Variable Rate Demand Preferred
shares are included as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of
offering costs" on the Statement of Operations. In addition to interest expense,
the Fund also paid a per annum liquidity fee which is recognized as "Liquidity
fees" on the Statement of Operations.

Inverse Floating Rate Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying
bond but also on the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates,
and because the inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of
loss of the greater face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as "(IF) - Inverse floating rate investment." An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction. In
such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as "(UB) - Underlying bond of an
inverse floating rate trust reflected as a financing transaction," with the Fund
accounting for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as
"Floating rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In
addition, the Fund reflects in "Investment Income" the entire earnings of the
underlying bond and recognizes the related interest paid to the holders of the
short-term floating rate certificates as "Interest expense and amortization of
offering costs" on the Statement of Operations.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, each Fund invested in
externally-deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is recognized as
"Unrealized depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

Futures Contracts

Each Fund is subject to interest rate risk in the normal course of pursuing its
investment objectives and is authorized to invest in futures contracts in
attempt to manage such risk. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund is
required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or liquid securities equal
to a specified percentage of the contract amount. This is known as the "initial
margin." Cash held by the broker to cover initial margin requirements on open
futures contracts, if any, is recognized as "Deposits with brokers for open
futures contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Subsequent
payments ("variation margin") are made or received by a Fund each day, depending
on the daily fluctuation of the value of the contract. Variation margin is
recognized as a receivable or payable for "Variation margin on futures
contracts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, when applicable.

During the period the futures contract is open, changes in the value of the
contract are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss by "marking-to-market" on a
daily basis to reflect the changes in market value of the contract and is
recognized as "Change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of futures
contracts" on the Statement of Operations. When the contract is closed or
expired, a Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the contract on the closing date and value of the contract when
originally entered into and is recognized as "Net realized gain (loss) from
futures contracts" on the Statement of Operations.

Risks of investments in futures contracts include the possible adverse movement
of the securities or indices underlying the contracts, the possibility that
there may not be a liquid secondary market for the contracts and/or that a
change in the value of the contract may not correlate with a change in the value
of the underlying securities or indices. Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) invested in
futures contracts during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009.

The average number of futures contracts outstanding during the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2009, was as follows:

                                                                       DIVIDEND

                                                                           (NZF)

Average number of futures contracts outstanding                              31*
================================================================================

*     The average number of contracts is calculated based on the outstanding
      contracts at the beginning of the fiscal year and at the end of each
      fiscal quarter within the current fiscal year. The Fund was not invested
      in futures contracts at the end of the current fiscal year.

Refer to Footnote 3 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further
details on futures contract activity.

Forward Swap Contracts

Each Fund is authorized to enter into forward interest rate swap contracts
consistent with their investment objectives and policies to reduce, increase or
otherwise alter its risk profile or to alter its portfolio characteristics (i.e.
duration, yield curve positioning and credit quality).

Each Fund is subject to interest rate risk in the normal course of pursuing its
investment objectives. Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap
transactions is intended to help the Fund manage its overall interest rate
sensitivity, either shorter or longer, generally to more closely align the
Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that of the broader municipal market.
Forward interest rate swap transactions involve each Fund's agreement with a
counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or variable rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable or fixed rate payment, the
accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the future (the "effective
date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional amount of
the swap contract and the termination date of the swap (which is akin to a
bond's maturity). The value of the Fund's swap commitment would increase or
decrease based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swap's termination date increases or decreases.
Forward interest rate swap contracts are valued daily. The net amount recorded
on these transactions for each counterparty is recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities as "Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on forward
swaps" with the change during the fiscal period recognized on the Statement of
Operations as "Change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of forward
swaps."

                                                           Nuveen Investments 89

<PAGE>

| Notes to
| Financial Statements (continued)

The Funds may terminate a swap contract prior to the effective date, at which
point a realized gain or loss is recognized. When a forward swap is terminated,
it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying
assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis. Net realized
gains and losses during the fiscal period are recognized on the Statement of
Operations as "Net realized gain (loss) from forward swaps." Each Fund intends,
but is not obligated, to terminate its forward swaps before the effective date.
Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such
transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with a counterparty
failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon
termination. The Funds did not invest in forward interest rate swap transactions
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009.

Market and Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business each Fund may invest in financial instruments
and enter into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to
changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to the
transaction to perform (counterparty credit risk). The potential loss could
exceed the value of the financial assets recorded on the financial statements.
Financial assets, which potentially expose each Fund to counterparty credit
risk, consist principally of cash due from counterparties on forward, option and
swap transactions. The extent of each Fund's exposure to counterparty credit
risk in respect to these financial assets approximates their carrying value as
recorded on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Futures contracts expose a
Fund to minimal counterparty credit risk as they are exchange traded and the
exchange's clearinghouse, which is counterparty to all exchange traded futures,
guarantees the futures contracts against default.

Each Fund helps manage counterparty credit risk by entering into agreements only
with counterparties the Adviser believes have the financial resources to honor
their obligations and by having the Nuveen Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"), monitor the
financial stability of the counterparties. Additionally, counterparties may be
required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of the
financial asset) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the
amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally,
when each Fund has an unrealized loss, the Funds have instructed the custodian
to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to
the amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral
pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the valuations
fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

Zero Coupon Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the Portfolios of Investments
with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description. The market prices of zero coupon
securities generally are more volatile than the market prices of securities that
pay interest periodically.

Offering Costs

Costs incurred by Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) in connection with its offering of
the Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares ($2,270,000) were recorded as a
deferred charge which will be amortized over the 30-year life of the shares and
are included as a component of "Interest expense and amortization of offering
costs" on the Statement of Operations.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

During the current fiscal period, the Funds adopted authoritative guidance under
GAAP on determining fair value measurements. This guidance defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosure
about fair value measurements. In determining the value of each Fund's
investments various inputs are used. These inputs are summarized in the three
broad levels listed below:

      Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

      Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
      similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

90 Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

      Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including management's
      assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities. The following is a
summary of each Fund's fair value measurements as of October 31, 2009:

3. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

During the current fiscal period, the Funds adopted amendments to authoritative
guidance under GAAP on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This guidance is intended to enhance financial statement disclosures
for derivative instruments and hedging activities and enable investors to better
understand: a) how and why a fund uses derivative instruments; b) how derivative
instruments are accounted for; and c) how derivative instruments affect a fund's
financial position, results of operations and cash flows, if any. The Funds
record derivative instruments at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized on the Statement of Operations, when applicable. Even though the
Funds' investments in derivatives may represent economic hedges, under this
guidance they are considered to be non-hedge transactions for financial
reporting purposes. For additional information on the derivative instruments in
which each Fund was invested during and at the end of the reporting period,
refer to the Portfolio of Investments, Financial Statements and Footnote 1 -
General Information and Significant Accounting Policies.

The following tables present the amount of net realized gain (loss) and change
in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) recognized for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2009, on derivative instruments, as well as the primary risk
exposure associated with each. Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) invested in derivative
instruments during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009. None of the Funds had
derivative contracts outstanding at October 31, 2009.

6. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
securities reflected as financing transactions, if any. To the extent that
differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented
in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences
do not impact the net asset values of the Funds.

At October 31, 2009, the cost of investments was as follows:

7. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate daily managed net assets of all Nuveen
      funds, with such daily managed net assets defined separately for each fund
      in its management agreement, but excluding assets attributable to
      investments in other Nuveen funds. For the complex-level and fund-level
      fee components, daily managed net assets include assets managed by the
      Adviser that are attributable to financial leverage. For these purposes,
      financial leverage includes the funds use of preferred stock and
      borrowings and investments in the residual interest certificates (also
      called inverse floating rate securities) in tender option bond (TOB)
      trusts, including the portion of assets held by the TOB trust that has
      been effectively financed by the trust's issuance of floating rate
      securities, subject to an agreement by the Adviser to limit the amount of
      such assets for determining managed net assets in certain circumstances.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

8. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets

During June 2009, the FASB issued changes to the authoritative guidance under
GAAP on accounting for transfers of financial assets. The objective of this
guidance is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its
financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a
transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a
transferor's continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets.

This guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first
annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods
within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting
periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. The recognition and
measurement provisions of this guidance must be applied to transfers occurring
on or after the effective date. Additionally, the disclosure provisions of this
guidance should be applied to transfers that occurred both before and after the
effective date of this guidance. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of this guidance and the impact it will have on the financial
statement amounts and disclosures, if any.

====================================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

Evaluation Date

In May 2009, the FASB issued changes to authoritative guidance under GAAP for
subsequent events. This guidance requires an entity to recognize in the
financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide
additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance
sheet. This guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting
and for disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance
requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated
subsequent events and the basis for that date - that is, whether that date
represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be
issued. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
June 15, 2009. The Funds have performed an evaluation of subsequent events
through December 28, 2009, which is the date the financial statements were
issued.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After expense reimbursement from Adviser, where applicable. Expense ratios
      do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the Fund's
      net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares.

(a)   The expense ratios in the above table reflect, among other things, the
      interest expense deemed to have been paid by the Fund on the floating rate
      certificates issued by the special purpose trusts for the self-deposited
      inverse floaters held by the Fund, as described in Footnote 1 - Inverse
      Floating Rate Securities.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After expense reimbursement from Adviser, where applicable. Expense ratios
      do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the Fund's
      net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares.

(a)   The expense ratios in the above table reflect, among other things, the
      interest expense deemed to have been paid by the Fund on the floating rate
      certificates issued by the special purpose trusts for the self-deposited
      inverse floaters held by the Fund, as described in Footnote 1 - Inverse
      Floating Rate Securities.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

*     Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
      market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
      period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
      month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
      reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
      over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
      price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
      used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

      Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
      changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
      asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
      if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
      on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
      reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for
      the last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
      market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
      from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**    After expense reimbursement from Adviser, where applicable. Expense ratios
      do not reflect the reduction of custodian fee credits earned on the Fund's
      net cash on deposit with the custodian bank, where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
      Preferred shareholders; Net Investment Income ratios reflect income earned
      and expenses incurred on assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred
      shares or Variable Rate Demand Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   The expense ratios in the above table reflect, among other things,
      payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred shareholders and the interest
      expense deemed to have been paid by the Fund on the floating rate
      certificates issued by the special purpose trusts for the self-deposited
      inverse floaters held by the Fund, as described in Footnote 1 - Variable
      Rate Demand Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating Rate Securities,
      respectively.

Annual Investment Management Agreement Approval Process

The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), provides, in
substance, that each investment advisory agreement between a fund and its
investment adviser will continue in effect from year to year only if its
continuance is approved at least annually by the fund's board members, including
by a vote of a majority of the board members who are not parties to the advisory
agreement or "interested persons" of any parties (the "Independent Board
Members"), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of considering
such approval. In connection with such approvals, the fund's board members must
request and evaluate, and the investment adviser is required to furnish, such
information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the advisory
agreement. Accordingly, at a meeting held on May 27-29, 2009 (the "May
Meeting"), the Boards of Trustees or Directors (as the case may be) (each, a
"Board" and each Trustee or Director, a "Board Member") of the Funds, including
a majority of the Independent Board Members, considered and approved the
continuation of the advisory agreements (each an "Advisory Agreement") between
each Fund and Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM") for an additional one-year period.
In preparation for their considerations at the May Meeting, the Board also held
a separate meeting on April 21-22, 2009 (the "April Meeting"). Accordingly, the
factors considered and determinations made regarding the renewals by the
Independent Board Members include those made at the April Meeting.

In addition, in evaluating the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board
Members reviewed a broad range of information relating to the Funds and NAM,
including absolute performance, fee and expense information for the Funds as
well as comparative performance, fee and expense information for a comparable
peer group of funds, the performance information of recognized and/or customized
benchmarks (as applicable) of the Funds, the profitability of Nuveen for its
advisory activities (which includes its wholly owned subsidiaries other than
Winslow Capital Management, Inc. ("Winslow Capital"), which was recently
acquired in December 2008), and other information regarding the organization,
personnel, and services provided by NAM. The Independent Board Members also met
quarterly as well as at other times as the need arose during the year and took
into account the information provided at such meetings and the knowledge gained
therefrom. Prior to approving the renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the
Independent Board Members reviewed the foregoing information with their
independent legal counsel and with management, reviewed materials from
independent legal counsel describing applicable law and their duties in
reviewing advisory contracts, and met with independent legal counsel in private
sessions without management present. The Independent Board Members considered
the legal advice provided by independent legal counsel and relied upon their
knowledge of NAM, its services and the Funds resulting from their meetings and
other interactions throughout the year and their own business judgment in
determining the factors to be considered in evaluating

                                                          Nuveen Investments 109

the Advisory Agreements. Each Board Member may have accorded different weight to
the various factors in reaching his or her conclusions with respect to a Fund's
Advisory Agreement. The Independent Board Members did not identify any single
factor as all-important or controlling. The Independent Board Members'
considerations were instead based on a comprehensive consideration of all the
information presented. The principal factors considered by the Board and its
conclusions are described below.

A.    NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

In considering renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board Members
considered the nature, extent and quality of NAM's services, including advisory
services and administrative services. The Independent Board Members reviewed
materials outlining, among other things, NAM's organization and business; the
types of services that NAM or its affiliates provide and are expected to provide
to the Funds; the performance record of the applicable Fund (as described in
further detail below); and any initiatives Nuveen had taken for the applicable
fund product line.

In reviewing the services provided and the initiatives undertaken during the
past year, the Independent Board Members recognized the severe market turmoil
experienced in the capital markets during recent periods, including sustained
periods of high volatility, credit disruption and government intervention. The
Independent Board Members considered NAM's efforts, expertise and other actions
taken to address matters as they arose that impacted the Funds. The Independent
Board Members recognized the role of the Investment Services group which, among
other things, monitors the various positions throughout the Nuveen fund complex
to identify and address any systematic risks. In addition, the Capital Markets
Committee of NAM provides a multi-departmental venue for developing new policies
to mitigate any risks. The Independent Board Members further recognized NAM's
continuous review of the Nuveen funds' investment strategies and mandates in
seeking to continue to refine and improve the investment process for the funds,
particularly in light of market conditions. With respect to closed-end funds
that issued auction rate preferred shares ("ARPs") or that otherwise utilize
leverage, the Independent Board Members noted, in particular, NAM's efforts in
refi-nancing the preferred shares of such funds frozen by the collapse of the
auction rate market and managing leverage during a period of rapid market
declines, particularly for the non-equity funds. Such efforts included
negotiating and maintaining the availability of bank loan facilities and other
sources of credit used for investment purposes or to satisfy liquidity needs,
liquidating portfolio securities during difficult times to meet leverage ratios,
and seeking alternative forms of debt and other leverage that may over time
reduce financing costs associated with ARPs and enable the funds that have
issued ARPs to restore liquidity to ARPs holders. The Independent Board Members
also noted Nuveen's continued commitment and efforts to keep investors and
financial advisers informed as to its progress with the ARPs through, among
other things, conference calls, emails, press releases, information posted on
its website, and telephone calls and in-person meetings with financial advisers.
In addition to the foregoing, the Independent Board Members also noted the
additional services that NAM or its affiliates provide to closed-end funds,
including, in particular, Nuveen's continued commitment to supporting the
secondary market for the common shares of its closed-end funds

110 Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

through a variety of programs designed to raise investor and analyst awareness
and understanding of closed-end funds. These efforts include maintaining an
investor relations program to provide timely information and education to
financial advisers and investors; providing advertising and marketing for the
closed-end funds; maintaining websites; and providing educational seminars.

As part of their review, the Independent Board Members also evaluated the
background, experience and track record of NAM's investment personnel. In this
regard, the Independent Board Members considered any changes in the personnel,
and the impact on the level of services provided to the Funds, if any. The
Independent Board Members also reviewed information regarding portfolio manager
compensation arrangements to evaluate NAM's ability to attract and retain high
quality investment personnel, preserve stability, and reward performance but not
provide an incentive for taking undue risks.

In addition to advisory services, the Independent Board Members considered the
quality of administrative services provided by NAM and its affiliates including
product management, fund administration, oversight of service providers,
shareholder services, administration of Board relations, regulatory and
portfolio compliance and legal support. Given the importance of compliance, the
Independent Board Members considered NAM's compliance program, including the
report of the chief compliance officer regarding the Funds' compliance policies
and procedures.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members found that, overall, the
nature, extent and quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to
the respective Funds under the Advisory Agreements were satisfactory.

B.    THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS AND NAM

The Board considered the investment performance of each Fund, including the
Fund's historic performance as well as its performance compared to funds with
similar investment objectives (the "Performance Peer Group") based on data
provided by an independent provider of mutual fund data as well as recognized
and/or customized benchmarks (as applicable). The Independent Board Members
reviewed performance information including, among other things, total return
information compared with the Fund's Performance Peer Group and recognized
and/or customized benchmarks (as applicable) for the quarter-, one-, three- and
five-year periods (as applicable) ending December 31, 2008 and for the same
periods (as applicable) ending March 31, 2009. The Independent Board Members
also reviewed performance information of the Nuveen municipal funds managed by
NAM in the aggregate ranked by peer group and the performance of such funds, in
the aggregate, relative to their benchmark. This information supplemented the
Fund performance information provided to the Board at each of its quarterly
meetings.

In comparing a fund's performance with that of its Performance Peer Group, the
Independent Board Members took into account that the closest Performance Peer
Group in certain instances may not adequately reflect the respective fund's
investment objectives and strategies thereby hindering a meaningful comparison
of the fund's performance with that of the Performance Peer Group. The
Independent Board Members further considered the performance of the Funds in the
context of the volatile

                                                          Nuveen Investments 111

<PAGE>

Annual Investment Management Agreement Approval Process (continued)

market conditions during the past year, and their impact on various asset
classes and the portfolio management of the Funds.

Based on their review and factoring in the severity of market turmoil in 2008,
the Independent Board Members determined that each Fund's investment performance
over time had been satisfactory.

C.    FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY

      1. Fees and Expenses

      The Board evaluated the management fees and expenses of each Fund
      reviewing, among other things, such Fund's gross management fees, net
      management fees and total expense ratios (before and after expense
      reimbursements and/or waivers) in absolute terms as well as compared to
      the fee and expenses of a comparable universe of unaffiliated funds based
      on data provided by an independent fund data provider (the "Peer
      Universe") and in certain cases, to a more focused subset of funds in the
      Peer Universe (the "Peer Group").

      The Independent Board Members further reviewed data regarding the
      construction of the applicable Peer Universe and Peer Group. In reviewing
      the comparisons of fee and expense information, the Independent Board
      Members took into account that in certain instances various factors such
      as the asset level of a fund relative to peers, the size and particular
      composition of the Peer Universe or Peer Group, the investment objectives
      of the peers, expense anomalies, changes in the funds comprising the Peer
      Universe or Peer Group from year to year, levels of reimbursement and the
      timing of information used may impact the comparative data, thereby
      limiting the ability to make a meaningful comparison. In addition, the
      Independent Board Members considered, among other things, the differences
      in the use and type of leverage compared to the peers. In reviewing the
      fee schedule for a Fund, the Independent Board Members also considered the
      fund-level and complex-wide breakpoint schedules (described in further
      detail below) and any fee waivers and reimbursements provided by Nuveen
      (applicable, in particular, for certain closed-end funds launched since
      1999).

      Based on their review of the fee and expense information provided, the
      Independent Board Members determined that each Fund's management fees and
      net total expense ratio were reasonable in light of the nature, extent and
      quality of services provided to the Fund.

      2. Comparisons with the Fees of Other Clients

      The Independent Board Members further reviewed information regarding the
      nature of services and fee rates offered by NAM to other clients. Such
      other clients include NAM's municipal separately managed accounts. In
      evaluating the comparisons of fees, the Independent Board Members noted
      that the fee rates charged to the Funds and other clients vary, among
      other things, because of the different services involved and the
      additional regulatory and compliance requirements associated with
      registered investment companies, such as the Funds. Accordingly, the
      Independent Board Members considered the differences in the product types,
      including, but not limited to, the services provided, the structure and
      operations, product distribution and

112 Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

      costs thereof, portfolio investment policies, investor profiles, account
      sizes and regulatory requirements. The Independent Board Members noted, in
      particular, that the range of services provided to the Funds (as discussed
      above) is much more extensive than that provided to separately managed
      accounts. Given the inherent differences in the products, particularly the
      extensive services provided to the Funds, the Independent Board Members
      believe such facts justify the different levels of fees.

      3. Profitability of Nuveen

      In conjunction with its review of fees, the Independent Board Members also
      considered the profitability of Nuveen for its advisory activities (which
      incorporated Nuveen's wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisers other than
      Winslow Capital) and its financial condition. The Independent Board
      Members reviewed the revenues and expenses of Nuveen's advisory activities
      for the last two years, the allocation methodology used in preparing the
      profitability data and an analysis of the key drivers behind the changes
      in revenues and expenses that impacted profitability in 2008. In addition,
      the Independent Board Members reviewed information regarding the financial
      results of Nuveen for 2008 based on its Form 8-K filed on March 31, 2009.
      The Independent Board Members noted this information supplemented the
      profitability information requested and received during the year to help
      keep them apprised of developments affecting profitability (such as
      changes in fee waivers and expense reimbursement commitments). In this
      regard, the Independent Board Members noted that they had also appointed
      an Independent Board Member as a point person to review and keep them
      apprised of changes to the profitability analysis and/or methodologies
      during the year. The Independent Board Members also considered Nuveen's
      revenues for advisory activities, expenses, and profit margin compared to
      that of various unaffiliated management firms with similar amounts of
      assets under management and relatively comparable asset composition
      prepared by Nuveen.

      In reviewing profitability, the Independent Board Members recognized the
      subjective nature of determining profitability which may be affected by
      numerous factors including the allocation of expenses. Further, the
      Independent Board Members recognized the difficulties in making
      comparisons as the profitability of other advisers generally is not
      publicly available and the profitability information that is available for
      certain advisers or management firms may not be representative of the
      industry and may be affected by, among other things, the adviser's
      particular business mix, capital costs, types of funds managed and expense
      allocations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Board Members
      reviewed Nuveen's methodology and assumptions for allocating expenses
      across product lines to determine profitability. In reviewing
      profitability, the Independent Board Members recognized Nuveen's
      investment in its fund business.

      Based on their review, the Independent Board Members concluded that
      Nuveen's level of profitability for its advisory activities was reasonable
      in light of the services provided.

                                                          Nuveen Investments 113

<PAGE>

Annual Investment Management Agreement Approval Process (continued)

      In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the Independent
      Board Members also considered other amounts paid to NAM by the Funds as
      well as any indirect benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any)
      NAM and its affiliates receive, or are expected to receive, that are
      directly attributable to the management of the Funds, if any. See Section
      E below for additional information on indirect benefits NAM may receive as
      a result of its relationship with the Funds. Based on their review of the
      overall fee arrangements of each Fund, the Independent Board Members
      determined that the advisory fees and expenses of the respective Fund were
      reasonable.

D.    ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

With respect to economies of scale, the Independent Board Members have
recognized the potential benefits resulting from the costs of a fund being
spread over a larger asset base, although economies of scale are difficult to
measure and predict with precision, particularly on a fund-by-fund basis. One
method to help ensure the shareholders share in these benefits is to include
breakpoints in the advisory fee schedule. Generally, management fees for funds
in the Nuveen complex are comprised of a fund-level component and a
complex-level component, subject to certain exceptions. Accordingly, the
Independent Board Members reviewed and considered the applicable fund-level
breakpoints in the advisory fee schedules that reduce advisory fees as asset
levels increase. In this regard, the Independent Board Members noted that
although closed-end funds may from time-to-time make additional share offerings,
the growth of their assets will occur primarily through the appreciation of such
funds' investment portfolio. While economies of scale result when costs can be
spread over a larger asset base, the Independent Board Members also recognized
that the asset levels generally declined in 2008 due to, among other things, the
market downturn. Accordingly, for funds with a reduction in assets under
management, advisory fee levels may have increased as breakpoints in the fee
schedule were no longer surpassed.

In addition to fund-level advisory fee breakpoints, the Board also considered
the Funds' complex-wide fee arrangement. Pursuant to the complex-wide fee
arrangement, the fees of the funds in the Nuveen complex generally are reduced
as the assets in the fund complex reach certain levels. The complex-wide fee
arrangement seeks to provide the benefits of economies of scale to fund
shareholders when total fund complex assets increase, even if assets of a
particular fund are unchanged or have decreased. The approach reflects the
notion that some of Nuveen's costs are attributable to services provided to all
its funds in the complex and therefore all funds benefit if these costs are
spread over a larger asset base. Generally, the complex-wide pricing reduces
Nuveen's revenue because total complex fund assets have consistently grown in
prior years. As noted, however, total fund assets declined in 2008 resulting in
a smaller downward adjustment of revenues due to complex-wide pricing compared
to the prior year.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members concluded that the
breakpoint schedules and complex-wide fee arrangement were acceptable and
reflect economies of scale to be shared with shareholders when assets under
management increase.

E.    INDIRECT BENEFITS

In evaluating fees, the Independent Board Members received and considered
information regarding potential "fall out" or ancillary benefits NAM or its
affiliates may receive as a result of its relationship with each Fund. In this
regard, the Independent Board Members considered revenues received by affiliates
of NAM for serving as agent at Nuveen's trading desk.

In addition to the above, the Independent Board Members considered whether NAM
received any benefits from soft dollar arrangements whereby a portion of the
commissions paid by a Fund for brokerage may be used to acquire research that
may be useful to NAM in managing the assets of the Funds and other clients. The
Independent Board Members noted that NAM does not currently have any soft dollar
arrangements; however, to the extent certain bona fide agency transactions that
occur on markets that traditionally trade on a principal basis and riskless
principal transactions are considered as generating "commissions," NAM intends
to comply with the applicable safe harbor provisions.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members concluded that any indirect
benefits received by NAM as a result of its relationship with the Funds were
reasonable and within acceptable parameters.

F.    OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The Independent Board Members did not identify any single factor discussed
previously as all-important or controlling. The Board Members, including the
Independent Board Members, unanimously concluded that the terms of the Advisory
Agreements are fair and reasonable, that NAM's fees are reasonable in light of
the services provided to each Fund and that the Advisory Agreements be renewed.

Reinvest Automatically Easily and Conveniently

NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET UP YOUR
REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price

116 Nuveen Investments

<PAGE>

per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of Terms Used in this Report

o     AUCTION RATE BOND: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
      payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
      process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
      Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
      sale are deemed to have "failed," with current holders receiving a
      formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

o     AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
      investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time
      period. It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year
      to equal the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change
      in NAV or market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains
      distributions, if any) over the time period being considered.

o     AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
      of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
      to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
      security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments
      or the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
      established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
      for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
      portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
      not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

o     INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities, also known as inverse
      floaters, are created by depositing a municipal bond, typically with a
      fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
      broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a) issues floating rate certificates
      typically paying short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties in
      amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or
      market value, and (b) issues an inverse floating rate certificate
      (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") to an investor (such as a
      Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure to a long-term municipal
      bond. The income received by the holder of the inverse floater varies
      inversely with the short-term rate paid to the floating rate certificates'
      holders, and in most circumstances the holder of the inverse floater bears
      substantially all of the underlying bond's downside investment risk. The
      holder of the inverse floater typically also benefits disproportionately
      from any potential appreciation of the underlying bond's value. Hence, an
      inverse floater essentially represents an investment in the underlying
      bond on a leveraged basis.

<PAGE>

o     LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
      over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
      is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to
      changes when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's
      or Fund's duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as
      interest rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the
      leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of
      the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

o     MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
      investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
      price.

o     NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's NAV per common share is calculated by
      subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares
      issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then
      dividing the remainder by the number of common shares outstanding. Fund
      NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

o     PRE-REFUNDING: Pre-refunding, also known as advanced refundings or
      refinancings, is a procedure used by state and local governments to
      refinance municipal bonds to lower interest expenses. The issuer sells new
      bonds with a lower yield and uses the proceeds to buy U.S. Treasury
      securities, the interest from which is used to make payments on the
      higher-yielding bonds. Because of this collateral, pre-refunding generally
      raises a bond's credit rating and thus its value.

o     TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
      investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
      investment.

o     ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest
      coupon to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to
      the holder of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the
      original purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the
      bond at maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of
      zero coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of
      bonds that pay interest periodically.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a
code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or

(To view the code, click on Fund Governance and then click on Code of Conduct.)

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees ("Board") determined that the
registrant has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in
Item 3 of Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit
committee financial expert is Jack B. Evans, who is "independent" for purposes
of Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other
filings with various regulatory authorities. In such capacity, Mr. Evans was
actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation
of financial statements. Mr. Evans also formerly chaired the audit committee of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                   Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP the Audit Committee approved in advance all
audit services and non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the
Fund, except for those non-audit services that were subject to the pre-approval
exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The
pre-approval exception for services provided directly to the Fund waives the
pre-approval requirement for services other than audit, review or attest
services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes
no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its
accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (B) the
Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the
engagement; and (C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's
attention, and the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the
audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

                 SERVICES THAT THE FUND'S AUDITOR BILLED TO THE
                  ADVISER AND AFFILIATED FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The following tables show the amount of fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP to
Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM" or the "Adviser"), and any entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with NAM that provides ongoing services to
the Fund ("Affiliated Fund Service Provider"), for engagements directly related
to the Fund's operations and financial reporting, during the Fund's last two
full fiscal years.

The tables also show the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval
exception. The pre-approval exception for services provided to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider (other than audit, review or attest
services) waives the pre-approval requirement if: (A) the aggregate amount of
all such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid to Ernst & Young LLP by the Fund, the Adviser and Affiliated Fund
Service Providers during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that
would have to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; (B) the Fund did not
recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and
the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the Fund's audit is
completed.

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. The Audit
Committee is required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP
provides to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the
engagement related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting
(except for those subject to the pre-approval exception described above). The
Audit Committee requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about
any non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last
fiscal year to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The
Committee considered this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's
independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit
Committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the Audit Committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the Audit Committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the Audit Committee at
the next Audit Committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board has a separately designated Audit Committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The members of the audit committee are
Robert P. Bremner, Jack B. Evans, Terence J. Toth, William J. Schneider and
David J. Kundert.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

      a)  See Portfolio of Investments in Item 1.

      b)  Not applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant invests its assets primarily in municipal bonds and cash
management securities. On rare occasions the registrant may acquire, directly or
through a special purpose vehicle, equity securities of a municipal bond issuer
whose bonds the registrant already owns when such bonds have deteriorated or are
expected shortly to deteriorate significantly in credit quality. The purpose of
acquiring equity securities generally will be to acquire control of the
municipal bond issuer and to seek to prevent the credit deterioration or
facilitate the liquidation or other workout of the distressed issuer's credit
problem. In the course of exercising control of a distressed municipal issuer,
NAM may pursue the registrant's interests in a variety of ways, which may entail
negotiating and executing consents, agreements and other arrangements, and
otherwise influencing the management of the issuer. NAM does not consider such
activities proxy voting for purposes of Rule 206(4)-6 under the 1940 Act, but
nevertheless provides reports to the registrant's Board on its control
activities on a quarterly basis.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer were to issue a proxy or that the
registrant were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security, NAM
would either engage an independent third party to determine how the proxy should
be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the instructions, of
the registrant's Board or its representative. A member of NAM's legal department
would oversee the administration of the voting, and ensure that records were
maintained in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6, reports were filed with the SEC on
Form N-PX, and the results provided to the registrant's Board and made available
to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER

The following individual has primary responsibility for the day-to-day
implementation of the registrant's investment strategies:

NAME                  FUND
PAUL BRENNAN          Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3.

Other Accounts Managed. In addition to managing the registrant, the portfolio
manager is also primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of
the following accounts:

                   TYPE OF ACCOUNT                   NUMBER OF
PORTFOLIO MANAGER  MANAGED                           ACCOUNTS     ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Brennan       Registered Investment Company     13           $13.3 billion
                   Other Pooled Investment Vehicles  0            $0
                   Other Accounts                    1            $1.06 million

*    Assets are as of October 31, 2009. None of the assets in these accounts are
     subject to an advisory fee based on performance.

Compensation. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of three basic
elements--base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. The
compensation strategy is to annually compare overall compensation, including
these three elements, to the market in order to create a compensation structure
that is competitive and consistent with similar financial services companies. As
discussed below, several factors are considered in determining each portfolio
manager's total compensation. In any year these factors may include, among
others, the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended by the
portfolio manager's investment team, the investment performance of the accounts
managed by the portfolio manager, and the overall performance of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. (the parent company of NAM). Although investment performance
is a factor in determining the portfolio manager's compensation, it is not
necessarily a decisive factor. The portfolio manager's performance is evaluated
in part by comparing manager's performance against a specified investment
benchmark. This fund-specific benchmark is a customized subset (limited to bonds
in each Fund's specific state and with certain maturity parameters) of the
S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index, an index comprised of bonds held by
managed municipal bond fund customers of Standard & Poor's Securities Pricing,
Inc. that are priced daily and whose fund holdings aggregate at least $2
million. As of October 31, 2009, the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index was
comprised of 54,552 securities with an aggregate current market value of $1,178
billion.

Base salary. Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary that is set at a level
determined by NAM in accordance with its overall compensation strategy discussed
above. NAM is not under any current contractual obligation to increase a
portfolio manager's base salary.

Cash bonus. Each portfolio manager is also eligible to receive an annual cash
bonus. The level of this bonus is based upon evaluations and determinations made
by each portfolio manager's supervisors, along with reviews submitted by his
peers. These reviews and evaluations often take into account a number of
factors, including the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended to
the NAM's investment team, the performance of the accounts for which he serves
as portfolio manager relative to any benchmarks established for those accounts,
his effectiveness in communicating investment performance to stockholders and
their representatives, and his contribution to the NAM's investment process and
to the execution of investment strategies. The cash bonus component is also
impacted by the overall performance of Nuveen Investments, Inc. in achieving its
business objectives.

Long-term incentive compensation. In connection with the acquisition of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., by a group of investors led by Madison Dearborn Partners in
November 2007, certain employees, including portfolio managers, received profit
interests in Nuveen's parent. These profit interests entitle the holders to
participate in the appreciation in the value of Nuveen beyond the issue date and
vest over five to seven years, or earlier in the case of a liquidity event. In
addition, in July 2009, Nuveen Investments created and funded a trust, as part
of a newly-established incentive program, which purchased shares of certain
Nuveen Mutual Funds and awarded such shares, subject to vesting, to certain
employees, including portfolio managers.

Material Conflicts of Interest. Each portfolio manager's simultaneous management
of the registrant and the other accounts noted above may present actual or
apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation and aggregation of
securities orders placed on behalf of the registrant and the other account. NAM,
however, believes that such potential conflicts are mitigated by the fact that
the NAM has adopted several policies that address potential conflicts of
interest, including best execution and trade allocation policies that are
designed to ensure (1) that portfolio management is seeking the best price for
portfolio securities under the circumstances, (2) fair and equitable allocation
of investment opportunities among accounts over time and (3) compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. All accounts are to be treated in a
non-preferential manner, such that allocations are not based upon account
performance, fee structure or preference of the portfolio manager, although the
allocation procedures may provide allocation preferences to funds with special
characteristics (such as favoring state funds versus national funds for
allocations of in-state bonds). In addition, NAM has adopted a Code of Conduct
that sets forth policies regarding conflicts of interest.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of October 31, 2009, the portfolio
manager beneficially owned the following dollar range of equity securities
issued by the registrant and other Nuveen Funds managed by NAM's municipal
investment team.
