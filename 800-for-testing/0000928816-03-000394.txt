SEMIANNUAL REPORT ON PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK

4-30-03

FROM THE TRUSTEES

[GRAPHIC OMITTED: PHOTO OF JOHN A. HILL AND GEORGE PUTNAM, III]

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you news of positive performance by Putnam Managed
Municipal Income Trust for the semiannual period ended April 30, 2003. Your
fund outperformed its benchmark index and came in well ahead of its peers as
measured by its Lipper category average. You will find details on page 7.

As you will see in the following report from your fund's management team,
these results were achieved in large measure by the fund's duration strategy
and a generally favorable interest-rate environment during the period.
Duration is a measure of a fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
The fund's weighting in high-quality bonds also enhanced results as the
demand for these securities by risk-averse investors helped elevate their
prices. The management team also offers its views on prospects for the fund
in the fiscal year's second half.

As we look back on one of the most challenging periods in recent investment
history, we would like you to know how much we appreciate your continued
confidence in Putnam. We believe that those who ride out the current
turbulence will be rewarded for their patience over the long term.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III
Chairman of the Trustees      President of the Funds

June 18, 2003


REPORT FROM FUND MANAGEMENT

FUND HIGHLIGHTS

* For the first six months of its fiscal year, Putnam Managed Municipal
  Income Trust had a total return at net asset value of 5.44%. The fund's
  return at market price was 5.95%.

* The fund's longer duration helped it to outperform its benchmark, the
  Lehman Municipal Bond Index, which returned 3.59% for the six-month period.

* The fund's duration and portfolio mix of high- and lower-quality bonds
  helped it outperform the average return for its Lipper category, High Yield
  Municipal Debt Funds, which was 3.14%.

* Index and Lipper results should be compared to fund performance at net
  asset value. See the Performance Summary on page 7 for complete fund
  performance, comparative index performance, and Lipper data.

PERFORMANCE COMMENTARY

The fund's solid returns were due in large part to a duration strategy that
made it more responsive to changes in interest rates relative to its
benchmark and many of its peers. (Duration is a measure of interest-rate
sensitivity; the longer its duration, the more responsive the portfolio will
be to rate changes.) Our high-quality bond position also proved to be an
asset, as investors continued to prefer relatively secure investments amidst
the uncertainty at home and abroad. Consequently, lower-rated bonds, which
contribute considerably to the portfolio's monthly income, underperformed
their higher-quality counterparts. This disparity in the performance of
higher- and lower-rated municipal securities is exhibited by the fact that
credit spreads -- the difference in bond yields at either end of the credit
quality spectrum -- widened for much of the six-month period.

The fund's results should also be considered in the context of a generally
favorable interest-rate environment. However, after a three-year rally in
fixed-income investments, the markets are beginning to ponder the return of
higher interest rates. We've been gradually positioning the fund for this
possibility to limit the price depreciation that typically accompanies a
rising-rate market.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust seeks to provide as high a level of
current income free from federal income tax as is consistent with
preservation of capital through investments in  investment-grade and
higher-yielding, lower-rated municipal bonds. The fund is designed for
investors seeking tax-exempt income and willing to accept the risks
associated with below-investment-grade bonds.

MARKET OVERVIEW

In what was a challenging semiannual period, municipal-bond yields fell
slightly, resulting in modest returns overall. Municipal bonds slightly
outperformed Treasuries for the period. Several factors contributed to the
difficult environment. The sluggish economy caused many state and local
municipalities to experience significant declines in tax revenues and
subsequent downgrades in credit quality. Difficulties in two sectors --
airlines and utilities -- dampened the performance of industrial development
bonds (IDBs), which are issued by municipalities but backed by the credit of
companies. Airline-backed IDBs suffered as United Airlines followed US
Airways into bankruptcy. In late April, American Airlines narrowly avoided a
similar fate. The electric power sector came under  pressure, affecting
performance of utility IDBs as well.

Lastly, the supply of municipal bonds grew throughout 2002. In terms of
supply, the California Department of Water Resources' bond issue was the
largest ever brought to market. New tobacco settlement bonds further boosted
supply. All told, over $320 billion in municipal bonds was issued in 2002 --
an all-time record. Supply has continued to swell in 2003, and has had a
dampening effect on municipal-bond prices.

STRATEGY OVERVIEW

The fund maintained its moderate exposure to higher-yielding securities. We
positioned the portfolio defensively in anticipation of the October
sell-off, but later returned to a more neutral stance by extending the
fund's duration. We diversified the fund further, and increased its exposure
to California tax-exempt bonds. We also reduced exposure to tobacco
settlement bonds, discussed further on page 5.

During the period, tax-exempt municipal bonds offered investors almost the
same yield as comparable Treasury bonds. This was an unusual situation, and
we expect the yield ratios will return to normal levels as the supply of
municipal offerings moderates and demand increases. To take advantage of
this opportunity, we established a cross-market arbitrage position, in which
we bought intermediate-term municipal bonds and shorted 10-year Treasury
futures contracts. Our thesis is that if interest rates should rise (causing
bond prices to fall), the fund would have a loss on the municipal bonds, and
yet, potential gains on the Treasury futures contracts may more than
compensate for the loss. On the other hand, if rates should fall (causing
bond prices to rise), a loss on the Treasury futures contracts may be
mitigated by a gain on the municipal bonds.

HOW KEY HOLDINGS AND ALLOCATIONS AFFECTED THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE

While the fund holds over 75% of its assets in high-quality investment-grade
bonds, it does selectively downgrade when the right market conditions and
investment opportunities present themselves. We think the fund's position in
lower-rated municipal bonds, which have been out of favor for some time, is
advantageous at this point and we believe these bonds can perform well in
the coming months, especially as the economy recovers.

We've seen a large supply of uninsured investment-grade hospital bonds come
to market in recent months, improving the number and quality of prospects
for your portfolio. In addition to refinancing older, more expensive debt at
today's historically low interest rates, hospitals in high-growth locations
are requiring more resources to finance their expansion in order to meet
increasing patient demand. Furthermore, hospitals are becoming more
specialized and moving beyond their core medical services. This trend has
meant that hospitals are developing a niche in such fields as cardiology or
oncology.

Several issues in the A to BBB credit-quality range were attractive to us.
Recent purchases include Mother Frances Hospital bonds, which were issued by
Tyler Health Facilities Corp. in Texas. These bonds are helping to finance a
new facility that will serve a growing population and a large cardiac
business, which we expect to improve operating revenues. The fund also holds
the A-rated Cleveland Clinic Health System bonds, issued by Cuyahoga County.
The Cleveland Clinic, which serves northeast Ohio and southwest Florida, has
a medical and educational reputation on par with Johns Hopkins and the Mayo
Clinic. While the Cleveland Clinic previously incurred investment losses, we
believe the steady, high-quality delivery of its core health services in its
target markets should eventually restore much of its diminished cash flow.

As percentages of market value. A bond rated Baa or higher is considered
investment grade. The chart reflects Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings;
percentages may include unrated bonds considered by Putnam Management to be
of  comparable quality. Ratings will vary over time.

The electric power sector is another industry undergoing great change,
providing unique investment opportunities as it transforms itself. In the
aftermath of the power crisis in 2002, utility companies that strayed into
non-utility-related activities such as telecommunications are in the process
of refocusing on their core business of power generation and distribution.
Overall, we think this trend is a positive one that will contribute to
improvements in credit-quality ratings throughout the sector. The fund's
A2-rated Georgia Power Company bonds, issued by Burke County, exemplify this
trend. This electric utility owns its own generation resources, receives 88%
of its revenues from cost-based regulated rates, and has a history of
regulatory support.

Tobacco settlement bonds, which are issued by municipalities and secured by
cash payments made in satisfaction of legal judgments against the tobacco
industry, are a relatively new class of municipal securities, which we
always approach with caution. These bonds tend to be higher-quality debt,
but because they are subject to special risks, they generally offer higher
yields than other bonds of comparable quality. During the reporting period,
we reduced the fund's exposure to tobacco settlement bonds, due to concerns
about the market becoming overwhelmed by the growing supply of new issuance.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to review
in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in the
future.

THE OUTLOOK FOR YOUR FUND

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could affect
your fund over the next six months, as well as the fund's management team's
plans for responding to them.

Our current outlook for the municipal-bond market is cautiously optimistic.
Fear of war has subsided. The focus is now on rebuilding Iraq and addressing
economic concerns on the home front. While much remains to be answered, the
level of uncertainty in the world seems to have eased a bit. We expect
business activity will accelerate slowly.

Although the tax-free marketplace is certainly not immune to the forces that
buffet other markets, it has historically been less volatile. We believe
municipal bonds should perform well relative to other fixed-income sectors
as some measure of calm returns to financial markets. We believe that
municipal budgets will continue to face significant pressures in the months
ahead. And we believe that governments will need to determine how to
implement costly home-front protection measures while at the same time
pushing tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. Historically, improvement in
the credit quality of state and local governments has lagged a general
economic recovery by six to nine months, so we expect municipal credit
quality to remain fragile for some time to come.

Currently, municipal-bond yields remain unusually high relative to yields on
taxable issues. In time, we expect that relationship will revert to a normal
range. In our opinion, the market continues to offer attractive value and
compelling risk/reward characteristics. We believe that we have positioned
your fund to take advantage of this potential.

A GUIDE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes, constitute
the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values as of
the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by asset type
and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of concentration and
diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together.  Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to determine
the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately for each class
of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount subtracted from
total assets includes the net assets allocated to remarketed preferred
shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss. This
is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from dividends and
interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses to determine net
investment income (or loss).  Then, any net gain or loss the fund realized
on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any unrealized gains or losses
over the period -- is added to or subtracted from the net investment result
to determine the fund's net gain or loss for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number of
the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net investment
income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting period and the
most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed here may not match the
sources listed in the Statement of operations because the distributions are
determined on a tax basis and may be paid in a different period from the one
in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment results,
per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment income ratios, and
portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting the five most recent
reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the highlight table also includes
the current reporting period. For open-end funds, a separate table is
provided for each share class.

      time of issuance. While the agencies may from time to time revise such
      ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings do not
      necessarily represent what the agencies would ascribe to these

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2003 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The fund's investment objective is to seek a
high level of current income exempt from federal income tax. The fund
intends to achieve its objective by investing in a diversified portfolio of
tax-exempt municipal securities which Putnam Investment Management, LLC
("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Putnam, LLC, believes does not involve undue risk to income or
principal. Up to 50% of the fund's assets may consist of high-yield
tax-exempt municipal securities that are below investment grade and involve
special risk considerations. The fund also uses leverage by issuing
preferred shares in an effort to increase the income to the common shares.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements is in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued on the basis of
valuations provided by an independent pricing service, approved by the
Trustees. Such services use information with respect to transactions in
bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable
securities and various relationships between securities in determining
value. Restricted securities are valued at fair value following procedures
approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security transactions
are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell is executed).
Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on the identified cost
basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts are
amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in excess of
the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date; thereafter, any
remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund owns
or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on securities it
owns or in which it may invest to increase its current returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures and
options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the hedged
instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the value of the
underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for the
contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is unable to perform. When
the contract is closed, the fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened
and the value at the time it was closed. Realized gains and losses on
purchased options are included in realized gains and losses on investment
securities.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the
value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
"variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last sale
price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for purchased options
and the last ask price for written options. Options traded over-the-counter
are valued using prices supplied by dealers. Futures and written option
contracts outstanding at period end are listed after The fund's portfolio.

D) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies.
It is also the intention of the fund to distribute an amount sufficient to
avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section 4982 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Therefore, no provision has been made for
federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized appreciation on
securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital gains.

At October 31, 2002, the fund had a capital loss carryover of approximately
$24,642,000 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future
capital gains, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates
are:

Loss Carryover      Expiration
- ------------------------------------
      $321,000      October 31, 2003
    11,188,000      October 31, 2005
     2,895,000      October 31, 2006
     3,629,000      October 31, 2007
     1,237,000      October 31, 2008
     1,642,000      October 31, 2009
     3,730,000      October 31, 2010

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $560,196,631, resulting in
gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $26,642,818 and
$52,429,919, respectively, or net unrealized depreciation of $25,787,101.

E) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on
the ex dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on re marketed
preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by the Trustees.
Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares is generally a
28-day period for Series A and Series B shares, and a 7-day period for
Series C shares. The applicable dividend rate for the remarketed preferred
shares on April 30, 2003 was 1.08% for Series A, 1.09% for Series B and
1.19% for Series C. The amount and character of income and gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Reclassifications
are made to the fund's capital accounts to reflect income and gains
available for distribution (or available capital loss carryovers) under
income tax regulations.

F) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares is
determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory services
quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee is based on
the following annual rates: 0.70% of the first $500 million of the average
weekly net assets, 0.60% of the next $500 million, 0.55% of the next $500
million and 0.50% thereafter.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred shares
for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to the proceeds
of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then the fee payable
to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by the amount of the
excess (but not more than .70% of the liquidation preference of the
remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and their
staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The aggregate amount
of all such reimbursements is determined annually by the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam Fiduciary
Trust Company (PFTC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Investor
servicing agent functions are provided by Putnam Investor Services, a
division of PFTC.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits realized
as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of the
fund's expenses. For the six months ended April 30, 2003, the fund's
expenses were reduced by $10,781 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $737 has been allocated to the fund, and an additional fee for each
Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive additional fees for attendance
at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan") which
allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of Trustees
fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain invested in
certain Putnam funds until  distribution in accordance with the Deferral
Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have served
as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension Plan are
equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and meeting fees for
the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense for the fund is
included in Compensation of Trustees in the Statement of operations. Accrued
pension liability is included in Payable for compensation of Trustees in the
Statement of assets and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended April 30, 2003, cost of purchases and proceeds
from sales of investment securities other than short-term investments
aggregated $89,403,022 and $77,040,786, respectively. There were no
purchases and sales of U.S. government obligations.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A (550), Series B (550) and Series C (650) shares are redeemable
at the option of the fund on any dividend payment date at a redemption price
of $100,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on
a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such
dividends have been declared) and, in certain circumstances, a call premium.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to maintain
asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed preferred
shares as of the last business day of each month in which any such shares
are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed preferred shares
and the shares' rating agencies. Should these requirements not be met, or
should dividends accrued on the remarketed preferred shares not be paid, the
fund may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain of the remarketed
preferred shares. At April 30, 2003, no such restrictions have been placed
on the fund.
