            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members of
 Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Company"),  including
the schedules of portfolio  investments and securities  sold, not yet purchased,
as of December 31, 2004,  and the related  statement of operations  for the year
then ended,  and the  statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the
two  years  in the  period  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis  for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal  control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities owned as of December 31, 2004, by  correspondence  with the custodian
and  brokers.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Advantage  Advisers  Xanthus
Fund,  L.L.C.  at December 31, 2004,  the results of its operations for the year
then ended, and the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended, in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

1.    ORGANIZATION

      Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized as a
      limited  liability company under the laws of Delaware in January 1999. The
      Company  is  registered  under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as
      amended,   (the  "Act")  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified   management
      investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless the Company is
      otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited  Liability  Company
      Agreement dated as of June 5, 2003. The Company's  investment objective is
      to achieve  maximum  capital  appreciation.  It pursues this  objective by
      actively  investing  in  a  portfolio   consisting   primarily  of  equity
      securities of technology  companies and of companies  which derive a major
      portion of their revenue directly or indirectly from technological  events
      and advances. The Company's portfolio of securities in the technology area
      is  expected  to  include  long and short  positions  primarily  in equity
      securities  of U.S.  and non-U.S.  companies.  Equity  securities  include
      common  and   preferred   stock  and  other   securities   having   equity
      characteristics,  including  convertible debt  securities,  stock options,
      warrants and rights.

      Responsibility   for  the  overall   management  and  supervision  of  the
      operations  of the Company is vested in the  individuals  who serve as the
      Board of  Managers  of the Company  ("Board of  Managers").  There are six
      members of the Board of Managers, one of whom is considered an "interested
      person"  under the Act.  The  Company's  investment  adviser is  Advantage
      Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability  company (the
      "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary of Oppenheimer  Asset  Management
      Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").
      The  Adviser  is  responsible   for  managing  the  Company's   investment
      activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory  agreement  dated June 5,
      2003. OAM is the managing  member and  controlling  person of the Adviser,
      and Alkeon Capital Management L.L.C.  ("Alkeon") is a non-managing  member
      of the Adviser.  Investment professionals employed by Alkeon including Mr.
      Takis Sparaggis, who serves as the Company's portfolio manager, manage the
      Company's portfolio on behalf of the Adviser under the supervision of OAM.
      Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation interest in Alkeon.

      The  acceptance of initial and  additional  contributions  from Members is
      subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  From  January 1, 2004 to
      December  31,  2004,  new  Members  were not  accepted  into the  Company,
      although  existing  Members as of December  31, 2003 were  allowed to make
      additional contributions. At a meeting held on November 1, 2004, the Board
      of  Managers  approved  the  acceptance  of initial  contributions  by the
      Company from new members on or after January 1, 2005. The Company may from
      time to time offer to repurchase  interests pursuant to written tenders by
      Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as
      may be  determined  by the  Board  of  Managers,  in  their  complete  and
      exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that generally it will recommend
      to the Board of Managers that the Company  offer to  repurchase  interests
      from Members  twice each year,  effective at the end of the second  fiscal
      quarter and again at the end of the year.

      Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not be
      liable for the Company's debts,  obligations and liabilities in any amount
      in  excess  of the  capital  account  balance  of such  Member,  plus such
      Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
      and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates  utilized
      in  preparing  the  Company's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and
      prudent; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

      A.    REVENUE RECOGNITION

      Securities  transactions,  including  related  revenue and  expenses,  are
      recorded  on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded  on  the
      ex-dividend date, net of applicable withholding taxes. Interest income and
      expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on fixed
      income securities are amortized using the effective interest rate method.

      B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted by
      the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

      (i)   Domestic  exchange traded  securities  (other than options and those
            securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

            (1)   at  their  last  composite  sale  prices  as  reported  on the
                  exchanges where those securities are traded; or

            (2)   If no sales of those  securities  are reported on a particular
                  day, the securities are valued based upon their  composite bid
                  prices for  securities  held long,  or their  composite  asked
                  prices for securities sold, not yet purchased,  as reported by
                  those exchanges.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      (ii)Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

            (1)   at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price ("NOCP")  (which is the
                  last trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern  Time) adjusted
                  up to NASDAQ's  best offer  price if the last traded  price is
                  below such bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best offer  price if the
                  last trade is above such offer price); or

            (2)   if no NOCP is available,  at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                  prior  to  the  calculation  of the  net  asset  value  of the
                  Company; or

            (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

            (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is  available,  the price
                  will be deemed  "stale"  and the value will be  determined  in
                  accordance  with  the  fair  valuation  procedures  set  forth
                  herein.

      Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange will be valued at their
      last sale  prices on the  exchange  where such  securities  are  primarily
      traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular day, at their
      bid prices (in the case of  securities  held long) or asked prices (in the
      case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported by such exchange.
      Listed  options will be valued at their bid prices (or asked prices in the
      case of listed  written  options)  as reported  by the  exchange  with the
      highest volume on the last day a trade was reported.  Other securities for
      which market  quotations are readily available will be valued at their bid
      prices (or asked prices in the case of securities sold, not yet purchased)
      as obtained from one or more dealers making markets for those  securities.
      If market  quotations  are not  readily  available,  securities  and other
      assets  will be valued at fair  value as  determined  in good faith by, or
      under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      Debt securities will be valued in accordance with the procedures described
      above,  which  with  respect to such  securities  may  include  the use of
      valuations  furnished  by a  pricing  service  which  employs  a matrix to
      determine  valuation  for  normal  institutional  size  trading  units  or
      consultation  with  brokers and dealers in such  securities.  The Board of
      Managers  will  periodically  monitor  the  reasonableness  of  valuations
      provided by any such  pricing  service.  Debt  securities  with  remaining
      maturities  of 60 days or less  will,  absent  unusual  circumstances,  be
      valued at amortized  cost, so long as such  valuation is determined by the
      Board of Managers to represent fair value.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      All assets and liabilities  initially expressed in foreign currencies will
      be converted into U.S.  dollars using foreign exchange rates provided by a
      pricing service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.  Trading in foreign
      securities  generally is completed,  and the values of such securities are
      determined,  prior to the close of securities  markets in the U.S. Foreign
      exchange rates are also determined  prior to such close. On occasion,  the
      values of such  securities  and  exchange  rates may be affected by events
      occurring  between the time such values or exchange  rates are  determined
      and the time that the net asset value of the Company is  determined.  When
      such events materially affect the values of securities held by the Company
      or its liabilities, such securities and liabilities will be valued at fair
      value as  determined  in good faith by, or under the  supervision  of, the
      Board of Managers.

      Fair value shall take into  account the relevant  factors and  surrounding
      circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing history (if
      any)  of the  security  or  other  investment;  (ii)  whether  any  dealer
      quotations are  available;  (iii) possible  valuation  methodologies  that
      could be used to  determine  fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation  of the
      Adviser  with  respect to the  valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
      securities or other  investments are held by other accounts or other funds
      managed by the Adviser and the  valuation  method used by the Adviser with
      respect thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value to be determined
      will  result from the use of data or  formulae  produced by third  parties
      independent of the Adviser;  and (vii) the liquidity or illiquidity of the
      market for the security or other investment.

      C.    CASH EQUIVALENTS

      The Company treats all  highly-liquid  financial  instruments  that mature
      within  three  months  at the time of  purchase  as cash  equivalents.  At
      December 31, 2004 $232,071 in cash equivalents were held at PNC Bank in an
      interest bearing money market deposit account.

      D.    INCOME TAXES

      No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes on
      the profits of the Company is made as the Members are individually  liable
      for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

      The  Company  has  reclassified   ($6,303,566)  and   ($15,588,707)   from
      accumulated  net  investment  loss and  accumulated  net realized  loss on
      investments,  respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year
      ended December 31, 2004. This  reclassification  was a result of permanent
      book to tax  differences  to  reflect,  as an  adjustment  to net  capital
      contributions,  the  amounts  of  taxable  loss and net  realized  loss on
      investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members and had no
      effect on net assets.

3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

      Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services  to  the  Company
      including,  among other things,  providing  office space and other support
      services.  In exchange for such services,  the Company pays  Oppenheimer a
      monthly  administration fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of the
      Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

      During the year ended December 31, 2004,  Oppenheimer  earned  $244,947 as
      brokerage  commissions from portfolio  transactions  executed on behalf of
      the Company.  Mainsail Group, L.L.C., a broker-dealer affiliate of Alkeon,
      earned  $835,156 as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio  transactions
      executed on behalf of the Company.

      Net  profits  or net  losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
      allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of
      all Members  (but not the Special  Advisory  Member) as of the last day of
      each fiscal  period in  accordance  with  Members'  respective  investment
      percentages  for the fiscal  period.  The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
      Special  Advisory  Member  of the  Company,  is  entitled  to  receive  an
      incentive allocation (the "Incentive Allocation"),  charged to the capital
      account of each Member as of the last day of each  allocation  period,  of
      20% of the  amount by which  net  profits,  if any,  exceed  the  positive
      balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive  Allocation
      is credited to the Special  Advisory  Account of the Adviser.  By the last
      business  day of the  month  following  the  date on  which  an  Incentive
      Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of the Incentive
      Allocation that was credited to the Special  Advisory Account with respect
      to the  allocation  period.  During  the year  ended  December  31,  2004,
      Incentive  Allocations  of $1,074 were  credited  to the Special  Advisory
      Member.

      Each  member of the Board of  Managers  (each a  "Manager")  who is not an
      "interested  person" of the  Company,  as defined by the Act,  receives an
      annual  retainer  of  $5,000  plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  Any
      Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive any annual or other
      fee  from the  Company.  Managers  who are not  "interested  persons"  are
      reimbursed  by the  Company  for  all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
      incurred by them in performing their duties.

      PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian")  serves as custodian of the Company's
      assets.

      PFPC Inc. ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to the
      Company and in that capacity provides certain  accounting,  recordkeeping,
      tax and investor related services. The Company pays PFPC an accounting and
      investor  services  fee based  primarily  on the average net assets of the
      Company as of the last day of each month,  payable  monthly,  subject to a
      minimum annual fee.

3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

      Oppenheimer  acts as the  non-exclusive  placement  agent for the Company,
      without special  compensation from the Company, and bears costs associated
      with its activities as placement  agent.  However,  the placement agent is
      entitled  to  charge  a  sales  commission  of up to 3% (up to 3.1% of the
      amount  invested)  in  connection  with a purchase  of  interests,  at its
      discretion.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, such sales  commissions
      earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $94,004.

4.    INDEMNIFICATIONS

      The  Company has entered  into  several  contracts  that  contain  routine
      indemnification  clauses.  The  Company's  maximum  exposure  under  these
      arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may be
      made against the Company  that have not yet  occurred.  However,  based on
      experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

5.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

      Aggregate  purchases  and  sales  of  investment   securities,   excluding
      short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2004, amounted to
      $1,679,923,806 and $1,637,808,347, respectively.

      At December 31, 2004,  the aggregate  cost for Federal income tax purposes
      of  portfolio  investments  and  securities  sold,  not yet  purchased  is
      $458,276,845, and $120,297,270, respectively.

      For Federal  income tax purposes,  at December 31, 2004,  accumulated  net
      unrealized  depreciation  on  investments  was  $2,166,571,  consisting of
      $22,746,492 gross unrealized appreciation and $24,913,063 gross unrealized
      depreciation.

      Due from broker  primarily  represents  proceeds from securities sold, not
      yet  purchased,  net of  unsettled  trade,  held at the prime broker as of
      December 31, 2004.

6.    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

      The Company  has the  ability to trade on margin and, in that  connection,
      borrow funds from brokers and banks for  investment  purposes.  Trading in
      equity   securities  on  margin  involves  an  initial  cash   requirement
      representing at least 50% of the underlying  security's value with respect
      to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with respect to
      transactions in foreign  markets.  The Act requires the Company to satisfy
      an  asset  coverage  requirement  of 300% of its  indebtedness,  including
      amounts   borrowed,   measured  at  the  time  the   Company   incurs  the
      indebtedness.  The Company pays interest on outstanding  margin borrowings
      at an annualized rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. The Company pledges securities
      as  collateral  for the  margin  borrowings,  which  are  maintained  in a
      segregated account held by the Custodian.  For the year ended December 31,
      2004,  the average daily amount of such  borrowings was $3,586,653 and the
      daily weighted average annualized interest rate was 1.71%.

7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE  SHEET RISK OR  CONCENTRATIONS  OF
      CREDIT RISK

      In the normal course of business,  the Company may trade various financial
      instruments and enter into various investment  activities with off-balance
      sheet risk.  These  financial  instruments  include options and securities
      sold, not yet purchased.  Generally, these financial instruments represent
      future  commitments  to purchase or sell other  financial  instruments  at
      specific  terms  at  specified  future  dates.  Each  of  these  financial
      instruments  contains  varying  degrees of off-balance  sheet risk whereby
      changes in the market value of the  securities  underlying  the  financial
      instruments may be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statement of
      assets, liabilities and members' capital.

      The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts which, at times, may
      exceed  federally  insured  limits.  The Company has not  experienced  any
      losses  in such  accounts  and  does  not  believe  it is  exposed  to any
      significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

      Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company to
      deliver  specified  securities and thereby creates a liability to purchase
      such  securities in the market at prevailing  prices.  Accordingly,  these
      transactions  result in off-balance  sheet risk as the Company's  ultimate
      obligation to satisfy the sale of securities  sold,  not yet purchased may
      exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of assets,  liabilities  and
      members' capital.

      The risk  associated  with purchasing an option is that the Company pays a
      premium whether or not the option is exercised.  Additionally, the Company
      bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value  should the
      counterparty  not  perform  under  the  contract.  Put  and  call  options
      purchased are accounted for in the same manner as investment securities.

      When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company is
      recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market
      value of the option written. If a call option is exercised, the premium is
      added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of the  underlying  security  in
      determining whether the Company has realized a gain or loss. In writing an
      option,  the Company bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the
      price of the security or index underlying the written option.  Exercise of
      an option  written by the Company  could result in the Company  selling or
      buying a security  at a price  different  from the current  market  value.
      During the year ended  December 31, 2004,  there were no  transactions  in
      written options.

                                  INTRODUCTION

Rule 206(4)-6 (the "Rule") adopted under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Advisers Act") requires all registered investment advisers that
exercise voting discretion over securities held in client portfolios to adopt
proxy voting policies and procedures.

Advantage Advisers, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Management, L.L.C., Advantage
Advisers Multi-Manager, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Private Equity Management,
L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Augusta Management, L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Troon
Management, L.L.C., and Oppenheimer Catalyst Management, L.P.(collectively, the
"Advisers") are registered investment advisers under the Advisers Act and are
therefore required to adopt proxy voting policies and procedures pursuant to the
Rule.

The Advisers act as investment advisers, managers or general partners to
registered and unregistered investment companies and managed accounts
(collectively, the "Accounts"). When an Adviser has investment discretion over
an Account's investment portfolio, then the Adviser votes proxies for the
Account pursuant to the policies and procedures set forth herein.

Investment discretion for a number of the Advisers' Accounts is exercised by
portfolio managers that are either non-managing members of limited partners of
an Adviser, or act as portfolio managers or subadvisers pursuant to agreements
with the Advisers and/or the Accounts (collectively, the "Portfolio Managers").
In all cases where Portfolio Managers exercise investment discretion over the
Accounts, the Portfolio Managers vote proxies for the Accounts in accordance
with the policies and procedures of the investment advisory firms with which the
Portfolio Managers are affiliated.

Appendix A hereto sets forth the Accounts for which each Adviser is responsible,
whether the Advisers' proxy policies or the proxy policies of the Portfolio
Managers are applicable to the Account.

                           VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES
                            IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS

These proposals seek shareholder votes for persons who have been nominated by a
corporation's board of directors to stand for election to serve as members of
that board. No candidates are opposing these board nominees.

In each analysis of an uncontested election of directors you should review:

      a)    Company performance

      b)    Composition of the board and key board committees

      c)    Attendance at board meetings

      d)    Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity

We may also consider:

      a)    Board decisions concerning executive compensation

      b)    Number of other board seats held by the nominee

      c)    Interlocking directorships

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       It is our policy to vote IN FAVOR of the
                                       candidates proposed by the board.

We will look carefully at each candidate's background contained in the proxy
statement. In the absence of unusual circumstances suggesting a nominee is
clearly not qualified to serve as a member of the board, we will vote with
management.

CHAIRMAN AND CEO ARE THE SAME PERSON

Shareholders may propose that different persons hold the positions of the
chairman and the CEO.

We would evaluate these proposals on a case by case basis depending on the size
of the company and performance of management.

6
<PAGE>

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS

Shareholders may request that the board be comprised of a majority of
independent directors and that audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the Board consists exclusively of independent directors. We believe that
independent directors are important to corporate governance.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       It is our policy to vote FOR proposals
                                       requesting that a majority of the Board
                                       be independent and that the audit,
                                       compensation and nominating committees of
                                       the board include only independent
                                       directors.

<PAGE>

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

      Shareholders may propose that directors be required to own a minimum
amount of company stock or that directors should be paid in company stock, not
cash. This proposal is based on the view that directors will align themselves
with the interest of shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. We
believe that directors are required to exercise their fiduciary duty to the
company and its shareholders whether or not they own shares in the company and
should be allowed to invest in company stock based on their own personal
considerations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals that require
                                       director stock ownership

<PAGE>

                            CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

Charitable contributions by companies are generally useful for assisting
worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill between the company and its
community. Moreover, there may be certain long-term financial benefits to
companies from certain charitable contributions generated from, for example,
movies spent helping educational efforts in the firm's primary employment areas.
Shareholders should not decide what the most worthwhile charities are.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       (Shareholders Proposals)
                                       Vote AGAINST proposals regarding
                                       charitable contribution.

Shareholders have differing and equally sincere views as to which charities the
company should contribute to, and the amount it should contribute. In the
absence of bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management should
determine which contributions are in the best interest of the company.

                      DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
                            AND LIABILITY PROTECTION

These proposals typically provide for protection (or additional protection)
which is to be afforded to the directors of a corporation in the form of
indemnification by the corporation, insurance coverage or limitations upon their
liability in connection with their responsibilities as directors.

When a corporation indemnifies its directors and officers, it means the
corporation promises to reimburse them for certain legal expenses, damages, and
judgements incurred as a result of lawsuits relating to their corporate actions.
The corporation becomes the insurer for its officers and directors.

<PAGE>

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals that eliminate
                                       entirely director and officers' liability
                                       for monetary damages for violating the
                                       duty of care.

                                       Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals
                                       that would expand coverage beyond just
                                       legal expenses to acts, such as
                                       negligence, that are more serious
                                       violations of fiduciary obligations than
                                       mere carelessness.

                                       Vote FOR only those proposals providing
                                       such expanded coverage in cases when a
                                       director's or officer's legal defense was
                                       unsuccessful if: a) the director was
                                       found to have acted in good faith, and b)
                                       only if the director's legal expenses
                                       would be covered.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The present environment in which directors operate provides
            substantial risk of claims or suits against against them in their
            individual capacities arising out of the discharge of their duties.

      2.    Attracting and retaining the most qualified directors enhances
            shareholder value.

                                SIZE OF THE BOARD

Typically there are three reasons for changing the size of the board. The first
reason may be to permit inclusion into the board of additional individuals who,
by virtue of their ability and experience, would benefit the corporation. The
second reason may be to reduce the size of the board due to expiration of terms,
resignation of sitting directors or, thirdly, to accommodate the corporation's
changing needs.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR the board's recommendation to
                                       increase or decrease the size of the
                                       board.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    These proposals may aim at reducing or increasing the influence of
            certain groups of individuals.

      2.    This is an issue with which the board of directors is uniquely
            qualified to deal, since they have the most experience in sitting on
            a board and are up-to-date on the specific needs of the corporation.

               VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS

Votes in contested elections of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

The following factors are considered:

      1.    management's track record

      2.    background to the proxy contest

      3.    qualifications of director nominees


13
<PAGE>

                                 TERM OF OFFICE

This is a shareholder's proposal to limit the tenure of outside directors. This
requirement may not be an appropriate one. It is an artificial imposition on the
board, and may have the result of removing knowledgeable directors from the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to
                                       limit the tenure of outside directors.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    An experienced director should not be disqualified because he or she
            has served a certain number of years.

      2.    The nominating committee is in the best position to judge the
            directors' terms in office due to their understanding of a
            corporation's needs and a director's abilities and experience.

      3.    If shareholders are not satisfied with the job a director is doing,
            they can vote him/her off the board when the term is up.

                             COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE

These proposals seek shareholder approval of a request that the board of
directors disclose the amount of compensation paid to officers and employees, in
addition to the disclosure of such information in the proxy statement as
required by the SEC regulations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       (shareholders policy)
                                       Vote AGAINST these proposals that require
                                       disclosure, unless we have reason to
                                       believe that mandated disclosures are
                                       insufficient to give an accurate and
                                       meaningful account of senior management
                                       compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Federal securities laws require disclosure in corporate proxy
            statements of the compensation paid to corporate directors and
            officers.

      2.    Employees other than executive officers and directors are typically
            not in policy-making roles where they have the ability to determine,
            in a significant way, the amount of their own compensation.

      3.    The disclosure of compensation of lower-level officers and employees
            infringes upon their privacy and might create morale problems.

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Shareholders must make certain that auditors are responsibly examining the
financial statements of a company, that their reports adequately express any
legitimate financial concerns, and that the auditor is independent of the
company it is serving.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR proposal to ratify auditors.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Although lawsuits are sometimes filed against accounting firms,
            including those nationally recognized, these firms typically
            complete their assignments in a lawful and professional manner.

      2.    Sometimes it may be appropriate for a corporation to change
            accounting firms, but the board of directors is in the best position
            to judge the advantages of any such change and any disagreements
            with former auditors must be fully disclosed to shareholders.

      3.    If there is a reason to believe the independent auditor has rendered
            an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
            financial position, then in this case vote AGAINST ratification.

                                  POISON PILLS

Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by
potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: a) dilute the acquirer's
equity in the target company, b) dilute the acquirer's voting interests in the
target company, or c) dilute the acquirer's equity holdings in the post-merger
company. Generally, poison pills accomplish these tasks by issuing rights or
warrants to shareholders that are essentially worthless unless triggered by a
hostile acquisition attempt.

A poison pill should contain a redemption clause that would allow the board to
redeem it even after a potential acquirer has surpassed the ownership threshold.
Poison pills may be adopted by the board without shareholder approval. But
shareholders must have the opportunity to ratify or reject them at least every
two years.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking
                                       that a company submit its poison pill for
                                       shareholder ratification.

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                       shareholder proposals to redeem a
                                       company's poison pill.

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                       management proposals to ratify a poison
                                       pill.

                                    GREENMAIL

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the
market, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Greenmail payments usually expose the company to negative press and may result
in lawsuits by shareholders. When a company's name is associated with such a
practice, company customers may think twice about future purchases made at the
expense of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti
                                       Greenmail or bylaw amendments or
                                       otherwise restrict a company's ability to
                                       make Greenmail payments

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                       anti-Greenmail proposals when they are
                                       bundled with other charter or bylaw
                                       amendments.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    While studies by the SEC and others show that Greenmail devalues the
            company's stock price, an argument can be made that a payment can
            enable the company to pursue plans that may provide long-term gains
            to the shareholders.

                               SUPERMAJORITY VOTE

Supermajority provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change regarding a company and
its corporate governance provisions. These proposals seek shareholder approval
to exceed the normal level of shareholder participation and approval from a
simple majority of the outstanding shares to a much higher percentage.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                       Vote AGAINST management proposals to
                                       require a Supermajority shareholder vote
                                       to approve mergers and other significant
                                       business combinations.

                                       Vote FOR shareholder proposals to lower
                                       Supermajority vote requirements for
                                       mergers and other significant business
                                       combinations.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Supermajority requirements ensure broad agreement on issues that may
            have a significant impact on the future of the company.

      2.    Supermajority vote may make action all but impossible.

      3.    Supermajority requirements are counter to the principle of majority
            rule.

                             CHANGING CORPORATE NAME

This proposal seeks shareholder approval to change the corporation's name. It is
probably better to vote for the proposed name change before management goes back
to the drawing board and spends another small fortune attempting again to change
the name.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR changing the corporate name.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    A name of a corporation symbolizes its substance.

      2.    There are many reasons a corporation may have for changing its name,
            including an intention to change the direction of the business or to
            have a contemporary corporate image.

      3.    The board of directors is well-positioned to determine the best name
            for the corporation because, among other reasons, it usually seeks
            professional advice on such matters.

                                 REINCORPORATION

These proposals seek shareholder approval to change the state in which a company
is incorporated. Sometimes this is done to accommodate the company's most active
operations or headquarters. More often, however, the companies want to
reincorporate in a state with more stringent anti-takeover provisions.
Delaware's state laws, for instance, including liability and anti-takeover
provisions, are more favorable to corporations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, carefully
                                       reviewing the new state's laws and any
                                       significant changes the company makes in
                                       its charter and by-laws.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The board is in the best position to determine the company's need to
            incorporate.

      2.    Reincorporation may have considerable implications for shareholders,
            affecting a company's takeover defenses, its corporate structure or
            governance features.

      3.    Reincorporation in a state with stronger anti-takeover laws may harm
            shareholder value.

<PAGE>

                 BOARD STRUCTURE: STAGGERED VS. ANNUAL ELECTIONS

A company that has classified, or staggered, board is one in which directors are
typically divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year terms;
each class's reelection occurs in different years. In contrast, all directors of
an annually elected board serve one-year and the entire board stands for
election each year.

Classifying the board makes it more difficult to change control of a company
through a proxy contest involving election of directors. Because only a minority
of the directors are elected each year, it will be more difficult to win control
of the board in a single election.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals to classify the
                                       board. Vote FOR proposals to repeal
                                       classified boards and to elect all
                                       directors annually.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The annual election of directors provides an extra check on
            management's performance. A director who is doing a good job should
            not fear an annual review of his/her directorship.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING

Most companies provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each
share owned, the so-called "one share, one vote" standard. This proposal seeks
to allow each shareholder to cast votes in the election of directors
proportionate to the number of directors times the number of shares owned by
each shareholder for one nominee.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals that permit
                                       cumulative voting.


The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Cumulative voting would allow a minority owner to create an impact
            disproportionate to his/her holdings.

      2.    Cumulative voting can be used to elect a director who would
            represent special interests and not those of the corporation and its
            shareholders.

      3.    Cumulative voting can allow a minority to have representation.

      4.    Cumulative Voting can lead to a conflict within the board which
            could interfere with its ability to serve the shareholders' best
            interests.

                 SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING

Most state corporation statutes allow shareholders to call a special meeting
when they want to take action on certain matters that arise between regularly
scheduled annual meetings.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or
                                       prohibit shareholder ability to call
                                       special meetings.

                                       Vote FOR proposals that remove
                                       restrictions on the right of shareholders
                                       to act independently of management.

                SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO ALTER SIZE OF THE BOARD

Proposals which would allow management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion are often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholders should support management proposals to fix the size of the board at
a specific number of directors, preventing management from increasing the size
of the board without shareholder approval. By increasing the size of the board,
management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                       Vote FOR proposal which seek to fix the
                                       size of the board.

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals which give
                                       management the ability to alter the size
                                       of the board without shareholder
                                       approval.

                               CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Confidential voting, also known as voting by secret ballot, is one of the key
structural issues in the proxy system. All proxies, ballots, and voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                       Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting
                                       that corporations adopt confidential
                                       voting.

                                       Vote FOR management proposals to adopt
                                       confidential voting.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Some shareholders elect to have the board not know how they voted on
            certain issues.

      2.    Should the board be aware of how a shareholder voted, the board
            could attempt to influence the shareholder to change his/her vote,
            giving itself an advantage over those that do not have access to
            this information.

      3.    Confidential voting is an important element of corporate democracy
            which should be available to the shareholder.

<PAGE>

                         SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES

These proposals request that the corporation establish a shareholder advisory
committee to review the board's performance. In some instances, it would have a
budget funded by the corporation and would be composed of salaried committee
members with authority to hire outside experts and to include reports in the
annual proxy statement.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals to establish a
                                       shareholder advisory committee.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Directors already have fiduciary responsibility to represent
            shareholders and are accountable to them by law, thus rendering
            shareholder advisory committees unnecessary.

      2.    Adding another layer to the current corporate governance system
            would be expensive and unproductive.

<PAGE>

                            FOREIGN CORPORATE MATTERS

These proposals are usually submitted by companies incorporated outside of the
United States seeking shareholder approval for actions which are considered
ordinary business and do not require shareholder approval in the United States
(i.e., declaration of dividends, approval of financial statements, etc.).

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR proposals that concern foreign
                                       companies incorporated outside of the
                                       United States.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The laws and regulations of various countries differ widely as to
            those issues on which shareholder approval is needed, usually
            requiring consent for actions which are considered routine in the
            United States.

      2.    The board of directors is well-positioned to determine whether or
            not these types of actions are in the best interest of the
            corporation's shareholders.


33
<PAGE>

                             GOVERNMENT SERVICE LIST

This proposal requests that the board of directors prepare a list of employees
or consultants to the company who have been employed by the government within a
specified period of time and the substance of their involvement.

Solicitation of customers and negotiation of contractual or other business
relationships is traditionally the responsibility of management. Compilation of
such a list does not seem to serve a useful purpose, primarily because existing
laws and regulations serve as a checklist on conflicts of interest.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST these proposals which a
                                       request a list of employees having been
                                       employed by the government.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    For certain companies, employing individuals familiar with the
            regulatory agencies and procedures is essential and, therefore, is
            in the best interests of the shareholders.

      2.    Existing laws and regulations require enough disclosure and serve as
            a check on conflicts of interest.

      3.    Additional disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of such
            individual's privacy.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals requesting that
                                       companies sign the CERES Principles.


The following factors should be considered:

      1.    We do not believe a concrete business case is made for this
            proposal. In our opinion, the company will be best served by
            continuing to carry on its business as it did before the proposal
            was made.

                              (MACBRIDE PRINCIPLES)

It is well documented that Northern Ireland's Catholic community faces much
higher unemployment figures then the Protestant community. Most proposals ask
companies to endorse or report on progress with respect to the MacBride
Principles.

In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, you must decide if
the principles will cause the company to divest, and worsen unemployment
problems.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       REFRAIN from voting on proposals that
                                       request companies to adopt the MacBride
                                       Principles.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    We believe that human and political rights are of the utmost
            importance for their own sake as well as for the enhancement of
            economic potential of a nation.

      2.    We do not believe a concrete business case has been made for this
            proposal. We will refrain from making social or political statements
            by voting for these proposals. We will only vote on proposals that
            maximize the value of the issuers' status without regard to (i.e.,
            we will not pass judgement upon) the non-economic considerations.

Proposals in this area generally request companies to report on or to adopt
certain principles regarding their operations in foreign countries.

The Maquiladora Standards are a set of guidelines that outline how U.S.
companies should conduct operations in Maquiladora facilities just across the
U.S.-Mexican border. These standards cover such topics as community development,
environmental policies, health and safety policies, and fair employment
practices.

                               AND DISCRIMINATION

In regards to equal employment and discrimination, companies without
comprehensive EEO programs will find it hard to recruit qualified employees and
find them at a long-term competitive disadvantage. Companies who are not
carefully watching their human resource practices could also face lawsuits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       REFRAIN from voting on any proposals

                                       and discrimination.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    We feel that the hiring and promotion of employees should be free
            from prohibited discriminatory practices. We also feel that many of
            these issues are already subject to significant state and federal
            regulations.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Needless cruelty to animals should never be tolerated. However, the
            testing of products on animals may be very important to the health
            and safety of consumers.

      2.    We also feel that this issue is already subject to significant state
            and federal regulation.

The ability to increase the number of authorized shares could accommodate the
sale of equity, stock splits, dividends, compensation-based plans, etc. The
board can usually be trusted to use additional shares for capital-raising and
other transactions that are in the corporation's best interests.

However, excessive escalation in the number of authorized shares may allow the
board to radically change the corporation's direction without shareholder
approval. Be careful to view that the increased number of shares will not enable
the company to activate a poison pill.

                                       is presented by the company.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Is this company going to make frequent business acquisitions over a
            period of time?

      2.    Is the company expanding its operations?

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

The terms of blank check preferred stock give the board of directors the power
to issue shares of preferred stock at their discretion, with voting, conversion,
distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of the
issue.

Blank check preferred stock can provide corporations with the flexibility to
meet changing financial conditions. However, once the blank check preferred
stock has been authorized, the shareholders have no further power over how or
when it will be allocated.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the

                                       other rights.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Blank check preferred stock can be used as the vehicle for a poison
            pill defense against hostile suitors, or it may be placed in
            friendly hands to help block a takeover bid.

                                PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

These proposals request that the corporation provide existing shareholders with
an opportunity to acquire additional shares in proportion to their existing
holdings whenever new shares are issued. In companies with a large shareholder
base and ease in which shareholders could preserve their relative interest
through purchases of shares on the open market, the cost of implementing
preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals seeking preemptive
                                       rights.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The existence of preemptive rights can considerably slow down the
            process of issuing new shares due to the logistics involved in
            protecting such rights.

      2.    Preemptive rights are not necessary for the shareholder in today's
            corporations, whose stock is held by a wide range of owners and is,
            in most cases, highly liquid.

                    ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK

The purpose of par value stock is to establish the maximum responsibility of
stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. It represents the
maximum amount that a shareholder must pay the corporation if the stock is to be
fully paid when issued.

The corporation requests permission to reduce the par value of its stock. In
most cases, adjusting par value is a routine financing decision and should be
supported.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR management proposals to reduce
                                       the par value of common stock.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    State laws sometimes prohibit issuance of new stock priced below
            that of the outstanding shares.

      2.    A corporation may be unable to raise capital if the par value is

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing shareholders
            be reduced and how extreme will dilution to future earnings be?

      2.    Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change of
            control of the company?

      3.    Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in
            severe losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the debt
            restructuring?

Directors represent shareholders and are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests. Companies state in the proxy material that they pay directors well in
order to attract the most qualified candidates. All compensation packages for
any executive, director or employee should include a pay-for-performance
component.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    As directors take an increasingly active role in corporate
            decision-making and governance, their compensation is becoming more
            performance-based.

            SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY

Shareholder compensation proposals that set limits or reduce executive
compensation should be closely scrutinized. Many of these proposals may be
flawed in their emphasis on an absolute dollar figure in compensation.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis


The following factors should be considered:

      1.    Executive compensation is established by a committee that consists
            of independent directors who have fiduciary responsibility to act in
            the best interest of the shareholders and who are best placed to
            make compensation decisions.

best-qualified corporate personnel and tie their interests more closely to those
of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       items are involved:

      1.    The exercise price for stock options is less than 85% of fair market
            value on the date of the grant.

      2.    It is an omnibus stock plan which gives directors broad discretion
            in deciding how much and what kind of stock to award, when and to
            whom.

      3.    The shares for issue exceed 8% of the company's outstanding shares;
            or, in the case of the evergreen plans, the amount of increase
            exceeds 1.5% of the total number of shares outstanding.

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals adopting share
                                       based compensation plans when the
                                       following items are involved:

      1.    Re-load options (new options issued for any exercised).

      2.    The plan would allow for management to pyramid their holdings by
            using stock to purchase more stock, without having to lay out cash.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a change in control. The change in control agreement will specify the
exact payments to be made under the golden parachutes. The calculation for
payout is usually based on some multiple of an employee's annual or monthly
compensation. Golden parachutes are generally given to employees whose annual
compensation exceeds $112,000.

Recent experience has shown a willingness of many managements to treat severance
agreements as equal to equity investments and to reward themselves as if
substantial amounts of equity were at risk.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote FOR proposals which seek to limit
                                       additional compensation payments.

                                       Vote FOR shareholder proposals to have
                                       golden parachutes submitted for
                                       shareholder ratification.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    The stability of management may be affected by an attempted
            acquisition of the corporation.

      2.    There is a tendency on the part of an entrenched management to
            overstate the value of their continuing control of and influence on
            the day-to-day functions of a corporation.

Based on the foregoing information:

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       We are FOR this proposal, which
                                       essentially bans golden parachutes,
                                       because we feel management's compensation
                                       should be solely based on real-time
                                       contributions to the corporation while
                                       they are serving it. Deferred current
                                       compensation is viewed differently than
                                       future, contingent compensation for

                       CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTES

These proposals suggest that the board of directors solicit shareholder approval
before committing acquisitions or divestiture of a business exceeding stipulated
threshold levels. Such statutes function by denying shares their voting rights
when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote AGAINST proposals which request the
                                       board to seek shareholder approval before
                                       committing to an acquisition.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    These proposals deprive the board of directors of its ability to act
            quickly in propitious circumstances.

      2.    Conforming to these requirements can be expensive.

      3.    The board of directors is uniquely qualified and positioned to be
            able to make these decisions without prior shareholder approval.

      4.    The threshold levels usually imposed by these proposals are much
            more stringent than required by law.

                       OPT-OUT OF STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES

These proposals seek shareholder approval to opt-out (not be governed by)
certain provisions of the anti-takeover laws of various states. Delaware law,
for instance, dictates that a bidder has to acquire at least 85% of a company's
stock before exercising control, unless he or she has board approval. This means
that a company may thwart an otherwise successful bidder by securing 15% of its
stock in friendly hands.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                       Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for these
                                       proposals.

The following factors should be considered:

      1.    It is the directors' responsibility to act on behalf of the
            shareholders in opposing coercive takeover attempts.

      2.    Creating deterrents to corporate takeovers may allow for
            entrenchment of inefficient management.

      3.    These statutes strengthen the board's ability to deal with potential
            buyers on fair and reasonable terms.

      4.    Shareholders should have the final say on whether the company should
            be merged or acquired.

CONFLICTS

From time to time, proxy voting proposals may raise conflicts between the
interests of the Advisers' clients and the interests of the Advisers, their
affiliates and their employees. Conflicts of interest may arise when:

      1.    Proxy votes regarding non-routine matters are solicited by an issuer
            that may have a separate account relationship with an affiliate of
            an Adviser or an investment banking relationship with Oppenheimer &
            Co. Inc., an affiliate of the Advisers.

      2.    A proponent of a proxy proposal has a business relationship with an
            Adviser or one of its affiliates or an Adviser or one of its
            affiliates has a business relationship with participants in proxy
            contests, corporate directors or director candidates.

      3.    An employee of an Adviser has a personal interest in the outcome of
            a particular matter before shareholders.

If an Adviser receives a proxy that to the knowledge of the Proxy Manager raises
a conflict of interest, the Proxy Manager shall advise the Governance Committee
which shall determine whether the conflict is "material" to any specific
proposal involved in the proxy. The Governance Committee will determine whether
the proposal is material as follows:

      1.    Routine proxy proposals are presumed not to involve a material
            conflict of interest.

      2.    Non-routine proxy proposals-Proxy proposals that are "non- routine"
            will be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest unless
            the Governance Committee determines that the conflict is unrelated
            to the proposal. Non-routine proposals would include a merger,
            compensation matters for management and contested elections of
            directors.


62
<PAGE>

CONFLICTS CONT'D

      3.    The Governance Committee may determine on a case by case basis that
            particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict
            of interest because the proposal is not directly related to an
            Adviser's conflict vis-a-vis the issue. The Governance Committee
            will record the basis for any such determination. With respect to
            any proposal that the Governance Committee determines presents a
            material conflict of interest, an Adviser may vote regarding that
            proposal in any of the following ways:

            a)    Obtain instructions from the client on how to vote.

            b)    Use existing proxy guidelines if the policy with respect to
                  the proposal is specifically addressed and does not involve a
                  case by case analysis.

            c)    Vote the proposal that involves the conflict according to the
                  recommendations of an independent third party, including, but
                  not limited to, Institutional Share Services Inc. or Investor
                  Responsibility Research Center.

                                 FOREIGN PROXIES

<PAGE>

SPECIAL ISSUES WITH VOTING FOREIGN PROXIES

      Voting proxies with respect to shares of foreign stock may involve
significantly greater effort and corresponding cost than voting proxies in the
U.S domestic market. Issues in voting foreign proxies include the following:

      1.    Each country has its own rules and practices regarding shareholder
            notification, voting restrictions, registration conditions and share
            blocking.

      2.    In some foreign countries shares may be "blocked" by custodian or
            depository or bearer shares deposited with specific financial
            institutions for a certain number of days before or after the
            shareholders meeting. When blocked, shares typically may not be
            traded until the day after the blocking period. The Advisers may
            refrain from voting shares of foreign stocks subject to blocking
            restrictions where in an Adviser's judgment, the benefit from voting
            the shares is outweighed by the interest in maintaining client
            liquidity in the shares. This decision is made on a case by case
            basis based on relevant factors including the length of the blocking
            period, the significance of the holding and whether the stock is
            considered a long-term holding.

      3.    Time frames between shareholder notification, distribution of proxy
            materials, book closures and the actual meeting date may be too
            short to allow timely action.

      4.    In certain countries, applicable regulations require that votes must
            be made in person at the shareholder meeting. The Advisers will
            weigh the costs and benefits of voting on proxy proposals in such
            countries on a case by case basis and make decisions on whether
            voting on a given proxy proposal is prudent. Generally, the Advisers
            will not vote shares in any such markets on routine matters such as
            uncontested elections of directors, ratification of auditors, etc.

                                 RECORD KEEPING


69
<PAGE>

RECORD KEEPING

The Advisers will maintain the following records:

      1.    Copies of these policies

      2.    A copy of each proxy statement that an Adviser receives regarding
            client securities. An Adviser may satisfy this requirement by
            relying on a third party to keep copies of proxy statements provided
            that the Adviser has an undertaking from the third party to provide
            a copy of the proxy statement promptly upon request.

      3.    A record of each vote cast on behalf of a client. A third party may
            keep these voting records provided that the Adviser has an
            undertaking from the third party to provide a copy of the record
            promptly upon request.

      4.    A copy of any document created by an Adviser that was material to
            making a decision on how to vote proxies or that memorializes the
            basis for that decision.

      5.    A copy of each written client request for information on how the
            Advisers voted proxies on behalf of the client and a copy of written
            response by an Adviser to any client request for information on how
            the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the client.

The above records shall be maintained for five years from the end of the fiscal
year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in
an appropriate office of the Advisers.

                         ALKEON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                               As of June 30, 2003

I.    POLICY

      Proxy voting is an important right of shareholders and reasonable care and
diligence must be undertaken to ensure that such rights are properly and timely
exercised. When Alkeon Capital Management, LLC ("Alkeon") has discretion to vote
the proxies of its clients, it will vote those proxies in the best interest of
its clients and in accordance with these policies and procedures.

II.   PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES

      (a)All proxies received by Alkeon will be sent to Alkeon's Compliance
Officer, currently Greg Boye. The Compliance Officer will:

            (1) Keep a record of each proxy received;

            (2) Determine if there are any routine proposals and vote them
accordingly (see Section III). If there are non-routine proposals, the
Compliance Officer will then forward the proxy to the Portfolio Manager or
Analyst responsible for that given security;

            (3) Determine which accounts managed by Alkeon hold the security to
which the proxy relates;

            (4) Provide the Portfolio Manager or Analyst with the date by which
Alkeon must vote the proxy in order to allow enough time for the completed proxy
to be submitted to the issuer prior to the vote taking place.

            (5) Absent material conflicts (see Section IV), the Portfolio
Manager or Analyst will determine how Alkeon should vote the proxy. The
Portfolio Manager or Analyst will send his or her decision on how Alkeon will
vote a proxy to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer is responsible
for completing the proxy and entering the vote information in the ADP ProxyEdge
system, or mailing the proxy in a timely manner if ADP ProxyEdge is not
available.

III.  VOTING GUIDELINES

      In the absence of specific voting guidelines from the client, Alkeon will
vote proxies in the best interests of each particular client, which may result
in different voting

<PAGE>

results for proxies for the same issuer. Alkeon believes that voting proxies in
accordance with the following guidelines is in the best interest of its clients.

            o     Generally, Alkeon will vote in favor of routine corporate
                  housekeeping proposals, including election of directors (where
                  no corporate governance issues are implicated) and selection
                  of auditors.

            o     Generally, Alkeon will vote against proposals that make it
                  more difficult to replace members of the issuer's board of
                  directors, including proposals to stagger the board, cause
                  management to be over represented on the board, introduce
                  cumulative voting, introduce unequal voting rights, and create
                  supermajority voting.

            o     Alkeon has determined that in most cases it will vote for the
                  expensing of stock options as the consensus feeling is that
                  options are an actual expense of a given issuer unless in
                  extraordinary circumstances approved by the Compliance
                  Officer.

      For other proposals, Alkeon shall determine whether a proposal is in the
best interests of its clients and may take into account the following factors,
among others:

      (1) whether the proposal was recommended by management and Alkeon's
opinion of management;

      (2) whether the proposal acts to entrench existing management; and

      (3) whether the proposal fairly compensates management for past and future
performance.

I.    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

      (1) The Compliance Officer will identify any conflicts that exist between
the interest of Alkeon and its clients. This examination will include a review
of the relationship of Alkeon and its affiliates with the issuer of each
security and any of the issuer's affiliates to determine if the issuer or its
management is a client of Alkeon or an affiliate of Alkeon or has some other
relationship with Alkeon or a client of Alkeon. Examples of conflicts would be
voting on any security of Bank of America or Fahnstock, as Alkeon manages funds
sponsored by both entities.

      (2) If a material conflict exists, the Compliance Officer will determine
whether voting in accordance with the voting guidelines and factors described
above is in the best interest of the client. The Compliance Officer will ensure
that all proposals are voted in the best interest of the client by having all
material conflicts reviewed by a proxy voting committee consisting of the
Compliance Officer and two Portfolio Managers.

<PAGE>

V.    DISCLOSURE

      (a) Alkeon will disclose in its Form ADV Part II that clients may contact
the Compliance Officer via e-mail at gboye@alkeoncapital.com or telephone at
(212) 389-8704 in order to obtain information on how Alkeon voted such client's
proxies, and to request a copy of these policies and procedures. If a client
requests this information, the Compliance Officer will prepare a report to the
client that lists, with respect to each voted proxy that the client has inquired
about, (1) the name of the issuer; (2) the proposal voted upon and (3) how
Alkeon voted the client's proxy.

      (b) A concise summary of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures will
be included in Alkeon's Form ADV Part II, and will be updated whenever these
policies and procedures are updated. The Compliance Officer will arrange for a
copy of this summary to be sent to all existing clients either as a separate

                                                                       July 2004

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES
        PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.    COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

      This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment companies
set forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

      o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships;

      o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Fund;

      o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

      o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or the Covered Officer's service to,
a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or
a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as
a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts

<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between a Fund
and its investment adviser or a third party service provider of which the
Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the applicable Fund or for its investment adviser or a
third party service provider, or for one or more of them), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationship between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company.

      Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o     not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund whereby
      the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

o     not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      the Fund; and

o     report at least annually his or her affiliations or other relationships
      that could potentially present a conflict of interest with the Fund.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o     Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

o     each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
      others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
      outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and auditors, and to
      governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o     each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within the
      Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
      necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
      other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser with
      the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
      disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or submits
      to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Fund; and


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

o     each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
      Fund with applicable standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
      laws, rules and regulations.

IV.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

      Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the Fund
      that the Covered Officer has received, read and understands the Code;

o     annually thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that the
      Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

o     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
      Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations of the
      Code that are made in good faith; and

o     notify the Compliance Officer of the Fund promptly if the Covered Officer
      knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a
      violation of this Code.

      The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to
the Fund and counsel to the Managers of the Fund who are not "interested
persons," as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, of the
Fund (the "Independent Managers"), and is encouraged to do so. However, any
approvals or waivers1 must be considered by the Independent Managers.

      Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
      Code:

o     the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate any
      reported potential violations;

o     if, after such investigation, the Compliance Officer believes that no
      violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take any
      further action;

o     any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
      reported to the Independent Managers;

o     if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the
      Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
      which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of, and
      appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
      notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment

- ----------
1     For this purpose, the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
      material departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the Fund's
      failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a
      material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been
      made known to Fund management.


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

      adviser or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to dismiss
      the Covered Officer; and

o     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act of each Fund, its investment adviser and principal
underwriter is a separate requirement applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and is not part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS

      Amendments to this Code may be made from time to time, as deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance Officer. The Board of each Fund shall be
informed of any such amendment to the extent deemed material by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

      All reports and records relating to a Fund prepared or maintained pursuant
to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such
matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

      (a)   All significant  deficiencies and material  weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial  reporting which are

      (b)   Any fraud,  whether or not  material,  that  involves  management or
