DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS

Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services,
L.L.C., at 800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If
you have shares registered in "street" name, contact your financial advisor or
the broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income
Fund, Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund, Delaware
Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, and Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund II, all distributions of net investment income and
capital gains to common stock shareholders are automatically reinvested in
additional shares unless shareholders elect to receive all dividends and other
distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to shareholders by the
dividend plan agent. Under the current policies of Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund and Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund III, distributions of net investment income and capital
gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash unless shareholders notify
Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. of their desire to participate in the dividend
reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.
You can contact Mellon at:

</TABLE>

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

(2) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that required
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    these changes for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.002, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.002, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.02%. Per share data for
    periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect these
    changes in accounting.

(3) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(4) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(5) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(6) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

(2) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that required
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. This change
    in accounting had no effect on the Fund's results of operations for the year
    ended March 31, 2002. Per share data for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have
    not been restated to reflect this change in accounting.

(3) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(4) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(5) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(6) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not

(2) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that required
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.006, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.006, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(3) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(4) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(5) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

(2) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that required
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.007, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.007, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(3) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(4) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(5) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(6) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

NOTES                       DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
 TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30, 2005 (Unaudited)


Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal
Fund"); Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.
("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal
Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund II") and Delaware
Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund
III") are organized as Minnesota corporations and Delaware Investments Florida
Insured Municipal Income Fund ("Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund") is
organized as a Massachusetts Business Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and
collectively as the "Funds"). Arizona Municipal Fund, Florida Insured Municipal
Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund II are considered diversified closed-end
management investment companies and Colorado Insured Municipal Fund, Minnesota
Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III are considered non-diversified
closed-end management investment companies under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Funds' common shares trade on the American Stock Exchange.
The Funds' preferred shares are traded privately through a remarketing agent.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide high current income exempt
from federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by the Funds.

Security Valuation - Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of each Fund's Board of
Directors. In determining whether market quotations are readily available or
fair valuation will be used, various factors will be taken into consideration,
such as market closures, aftermarket trading or significant events after local
market trading (e.g., government actions or pronouncements, trading volume or
volatility on markets, exchanges among dealers, or news events).

Federal Income Taxes - Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Other - Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of
Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of average net assets.
Management fees and some other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions
are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date).
Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest
income over the lives of the respective securities. Each Fund declares and pays
dividends from net investment income monthly and distributions from net realized
gain on investments, if any, annually. In addition, in order to satisfy certain
distribution requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Funds may declare
special year-end dividend and capital gains distributions during November or
December to shareholders of record on a date in such month. Such distributions,
if received by shareholders by January 31, are deemed to have been paid by the
Funds and received by shareholders on the earlier of the date paid or December
31 of the prior year.
<PAGE>

The Funds receive earnings credits from their custodian when positive cash
balances are maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. The expense paid
under the above arrangement is included in custodian fees on the Statements of
Operations with the corresponding expense offset shown as "expense paid
indirectly." The amount of this expense for the six months ended September 30,
2005 was as follows:

2. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
WITH AFFILIATES
In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%
which is calculated daily based on the average weekly net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

DMC has voluntarily agreed to waive that portion, if any, of its management fee
and reimburse the Minnesota Municipal Fund to the extent necessary to ensure
that annual operating expenses, exclusive of taxes, interest, brokerage
commissions, remarketing and rating agency fees, certain insurance costs and
extraordinary expenses, do not exceed 0.72% of average daily net assets of the
Fund, including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be
outstanding, through September 30, 2006. This waiver may be revoked at any time.

Delaware Service Company, Inc. (DSC), an affiliate of DMC, provides accounting
and administration services. Effective May 19, 2005, the Funds pay DSC a monthly
fee computed at the annual rate of 0.04% of the Funds' average daily net assets
for accounting and administration services. Prior to May 19, 2005, the Funds
paid DSC a monthly fee based on average net assets subject to certain minimums
for accounting and administration services.

4. DIVIDEND AND DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION
Income and long-term capital gain distributions are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Additionally, net short-term gains on sales of
investment securities are treated as ordinary income for federal income tax
purposes. The tax character of dividends and distributions paid during the six
months ended September 30, 2005 and the year ended March 31, 2005 was as
follows:

The difference between book basis and tax basis components of net assets are
primarily attributable to tax deferral of losses on wash sales and tax treatment
of market discount and premium on debt instruments.

For federal income tax purposes, capital loss carryforwards may be carried
forward and applied against future capital gains. Capital loss carryforwards
outstanding at March 31, 2005 will expire as follows:

For the six months ended September 30, 2005, each Fund had capital gains
(losses), which may reduce (increase) the capital loss carryforwards as follows:

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the
tax character of permanent book/tax differences. For the six months ended
September 30, 2005, the Funds recorded an estimate of these differences since
the final tax characteristics cannot be determined until fiscal year end.
Reclassifications are primarily due to tax treatment of market discount and
premium on certain debt instruments. Results of operations and net assets were
not affected by these reclassifications. For the six months ended September 30,
2005, the Funds recorded the following reclassifications.

5. CAPITAL STOCK (CONTINUED)
Dividends for the outstanding preferred shares of each Fund are cumulative at a
rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the six months ended September 30,
2005 as follows:

Fund                                                            Low       High

Arizona Municipal Fund                                         2.10%  to  2.95%
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund                                1.00%  to  2.85%
Florida Insured Municipal Fund                                 2.10%  to  3.00%
Minnesota Municipal Fund                                       1.75%  to  2.95%
Minnesota Municipal Fund II                                    1.90%  to  3.05%
Minnesota Municipal Fund III                                   2.20%  to  3.00%

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (formerly Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.), and
Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. (Colorado Insured Municipal Fund
only), as the remarketing agents, receive an annual fee from each of the Funds
of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred stock outstanding.

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant to Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassificiation as a closed-end
investment company or (c) changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS
The Funds use leverage in the form of preferred shares. Leveraging may result in
a higher degree of volatility because each Fund's net asset value could be more
sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates and changes in market
value of portfolio securities attributable to the leverage.

The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the states, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels
of supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment
for their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.
<PAGE>

Each Fund may invest in advanced refunded bonds, escrow secured bonds or
defeased bonds. Under current federal tax laws and regulations, state and local
government borrowers are permitted to refinance outstanding bonds by issuing new
bonds. The issuer refinances the outstanding debt to either reduce interest
costs or to remove or alter restrictive covenants imposed by the bonds being
refinanced. A refunding transaction where the municipal securities are being
refunded within 90 days or less from the issuance of the refunding issue is
known as a "current refunding". "Advance refunded bonds" are bonds in which the
refunded bond issue remains outstanding for more than 90 days following the
issuance of the refunding issue. In an advance refunding, the issuer will use
the proceeds of a new bond issue to purchase high grade interest bearing debt
securities which are then deposited in an irrevocable escrow account held by an
escrow agent to secure all future payments of principal and interest and bond
premium of the advance refunded bond. Bonds are "escrowed to maturity" when the
proceeds of the refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for
investment sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest on the original
interest payment and maturity dates. Bonds are considered "pre-refunded" when
the refunding issue's proceeds are escrowed only until a permitted call date or
dates on the refunded issue with the refunded issue being redeemed at the time,
including any required premium. Bonds become "defeased" when the rights and
interests of the bondholders and of their lien on the pledged revenues or other
security under the terms of the bond contract are substituted with an
alternative source of revenues (the escrow securities) sufficient to meet
payments of principal and interest to maturity or to the first call dates.
Escrowed secured bonds will often receive a rating of AAA from Moody's Investors
Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, and/or Fitch due to the strong
credit quality of the escrow securities and the irrevocable nature of the escrow
deposit agreement.

Each Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in illiquid securities, which
may include securities with contractual restrictions on resale, securities
exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and other securities which may not be readily marketable. The relative
illiquidity of these securities may impair each Fund from disposing of them in a
timely manner and at a fair price when it is necessary or desirable to do so. At
September 30, 2005, there were no Rule 144A securities and no securities have
been determined to be illiquid under the Funds' Liquidity Procedures. While
maintaining oversight, each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to
DMC the day-to-day functions of determining whether individual securities are
liquid for purposes of a Funds' limitation on investments in illiquid assets.

  TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Funds enter into contracts in the normal course of business that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts. Management has reviewed each Fund's existing
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENT.
On August 18, 2005, the Board of Directors of each of the Minnesota Municipal
Income Fund, Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II and Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund III approved an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition among Minnesota Municipal
Income Fund and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III (each, an "Acquired Fund,"
and collectively, the "Acquired Funds") and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II
(the "Acquiring Fund") and DMC providing for (i) the acquisition by the
Acquiring Fund of substantially all of the assets of the Acquired Funds in
exchange for common and/or preferred shares of the Acquiring Fund; (ii) the pro
rata distribution of those Acquiring Fund common and/or preferred shares to
shareholders of the Acquired Funds; and (iii) the subsequent dissolution of the
Acquired Funds (the "Reorganization"). The Reorganization is designed to be a
tax-free merger of investment companies. If approved by shareholders of both the
Acquired and Acquiring Funds, it is expected that the Reorganization would close
by the end of the first quarter of 2006.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
At a meeting held on May 18-19, 2005 (the "Annual Meeting"), the Board of
Directors, including a majority of disinterested or independent Directors, and
the Board of Trustees, including a majority of disinterested or indepentent
Trustees for the Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund, (a
"Fund"); approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreements for the
Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc.; Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.; Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund, Inc.; Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund II, Inc.; and Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III,
Inc. (each a "Fund" and together with Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund the "Funds"). In making its decision, the Board considered
information furnished throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as
information prepared specifically in connection with the Annual Meeting.
Information furnished and discussed throughout the year included reports
detailing Fund performance, investment strategies, expenses, compliance matters
and other services provided by Delaware Management Company ("DMC"), the
investment advisor. Information furnished specifically in connection with the
Annual Meeting included materials provided by DMC and its affiliates ("Delaware
Investments") concerning, among other things, the level of services provided to
the Funds, the costs of such services to the Funds, economies of scale and the
financial condition and profitability of Delaware Investments. In addition, in
connection with the Annual Meeting, the Board separately received and reviewed
independent historical and comparative reports prepared by Lipper Inc.
("Lipper"), an independent statistical compilation organization. The Lipper
reports compared each Fund's investment performance and expenses with those of
other comparable mutual funds. The Board also requested and received certain
supplemental

OTHER                       DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
  FUND INFORMATION (CONTINUED)


information regarding management's policy with respect to advisory fee levels
and its philosophy with respect to breakpoints; the structure of portfolio
manager compensation; the investment manager's profitability organized by client
type, including the Funds; and any constraints or limitations on the
availability of securities in certain investment styles which might inhibit the
advisor's ability to fully invest in accordance with the Funds' policies.

In considering such materials, the independent Directors/Trustees received
assistance and advice from and met separately with independent counsel and
representatives from Lipper. At the meeting with representatives from Lipper,
Jude Driscoll, Chairman of the Delaware Investments Family of Funds, and
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the investment advisor, was present to
respond to questions raised by Lipper and the independent Directors/Trustees.
While the Board considered the Investment Advisory Agreements for all of the
funds in the Delaware Investments Family of Funds at the same Board meeting,
information was provided and considered by the Board for each fund individually.
In approving the continuance of the Investment Advisory Agreements for the
Funds, the Board, including a majority of independent Directors/Trustees,
determined that the existing advisory fee structure was fair and reasonable and
that the continuance of the Investment Advisory Agreements was in the best
interests of the Funds and their shareholders. While attention was given to all
information furnished, the following discusses the primary factors relevant to
the Board's deliberations and determination, including those relating to the
selection of the investment advisor and the approval of the advisory fee.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. Consideration was given to the services
provided by Delaware Investments to the Funds and their shareholders. In
reviewing the nature, extent and quality of services, the Board emphasized
reports furnished to it throughout the year at regular Board meetings covering
matters such as the compliance of portfolio managers with the investment
policies, strategies and restrictions for the Funds, the compliance of
management personnel with the Code of Ethics adopted throughout the Delaware
Investments Family of Funds complex, the adherence to fair value pricing
procedures as established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. The Board noted that it was pleased with the current staffing of
the Funds' investment advisor during the past year, the emphasis on research and
the compensation system for advisory personnel. Favorable consideration was
given to DMC's efforts to maintain, and in some instances increase, financial
and human resources committed to fund matters. Other factors taken into account
by the Board were Delaware Investments' preparedness for, and response to, legal
and regulatory matters. The Board was satisfied with the nature, extent and
quality of the overall services provided by Delaware Investments.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board considered the investment performance of DMC
and the Funds. The Board was pleased by DMC's investment performance, noting
Barron's ranking of the Delaware Investments Family of Funds in the top quartile
of mutual fund families for 2002 -- 2004. The Board placed significant emphasis
on the investment performance of the Funds in view of its importance to
shareholders. While consideration was given to performance reports and
discussions with portfolio managers at Board meetings throughout the year,
particular attention in assessing performance was given to the Lipper reports
furnished for the Annual Meeting. The Lipper reports prepared for each Fund
showed the investment performance of its shares in comparison to a group of
similar funds as selected by Lipper (the "Performance Universe"). A fund with
the highest performance is ranked first, and a fund with the lowest is ranked
last. The highest/best performing 25% of funds in the Performance Universe make
up the first quartile; the next 25% -- the second quartile; the next 25% -- the
third quartile; and the lowest/worst performing 25% of funds in the Performance
Universe make up the fourth quartile. Comparative annualized performance for the
Funds was shown for the past one, three, five and 10 year periods ended February
28, 2005. The Board noted its objective that each Fund's performance be at or
above the median of its Performance Universe. The following paragraphs summarize
the performance results for the Funds and the Board's view of such performance.

Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The Performance
Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end other
states municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report comparison
showed that the Fund's total return for the one, five and 10 year periods was in
the second quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further showed that
the Fund's total return for the three year period was in the third quartile. The
Board noted that the Fund's performance results were mixed but on an overall
basis tended toward median, which was acceptable.

Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The
Performance Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged
closed-end other states municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper
report comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one year period
was in the fourth quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further
showed that the Fund's total return for the three and 10 year periods was in the
second quartile and the Fund's total return for the five year period was in the
first quartile. The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were mixed
but on an overall basis tended toward median, which was acceptable.
<PAGE>

Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund -- The Performance
Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end
Florida municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report comparison
showed that the Fund's total return for the one, three and five year periods was
in the fourth quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further showed
that the Fund's total return for the 10 year period was in the first quartile.
The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were not in line with the
Board's objective. The Board also noted that the Performance Universe is not
comprised solely of insured funds. Many of the funds (even certain of the
insured funds) in the Performance Universe can maintain exposure to BBB rated
bonds, which have significantly outperformed the AAA rated bonds that the Fund
invests in. Based upon the Fund's investment restrictions and the composition of
the Performance Universes, the Board was satisfied with the Fund's performance
results.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The Performance
Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end
Minnesota municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report
comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one period was in the
second quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further showed that the
Fund's total return for the three, five and 10 year periods was in the fourth
quartile. The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were mixed. The
Board also noted that DMC serves as advisor to three of the five funds in the
Performance Universe. Accordingly, poor relative performance can be misleading.
Given the size and composition of the Performance Universe, the Board was
satisfied with the Fund's performance results.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. -- The Performance
Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end
Minnesota municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report
comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one,

OTHER                       DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
  FUND INFORMATION (CONTINUED)


three, five and 10 year periods was in the first quartile of such Performance
Universe. The Board was satisfied with such performance.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc. -- The
Performance Universe for this Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged
closed-end Minnesota municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper
report comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one year period
was in the third quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further
showed that the Fund's total return for the three, five and 10 year periods was
in the first quartile. The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were
mixed. The Board also noted that DMC serves as advisor to three of the five
funds in the Performance Universe. Accordingly, poor relative performance can be
misleading. Given the size and composition of the Performance Universe, the
Board was satisfied with the Fund's performance results.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. The Board considered expense comparison data for the
Delaware Investments Family of Funds, Delaware Investments' institutional
separate account business and other lines of business at Delaware Investments.
The Board stated its belief that, given the differing level of service provided
to Delaware Investments' various clients and other factors that related to the
establishment of fee levels, variations in the levels of fees and expenses were
justified. The Board placed significant emphasis on the comparative analysis of
the management fees and total expense ratios of each Fund compared with those of
a group of similar leveraged closed-end funds as selected by Lipper (the
"Expense Group") and among the other Delaware Investments funds. In reviewing
comparative costs, each Fund's contractual management fee and the actual
management fee incurred by the Fund were compared with the contractual
management fees (assuming all funds in the Expense Group were similar in size to
the Fund) and actual management fees (as reported by each fund) of other funds
within the Expense Group, taking into effect any applicable breakpoints and fee
waivers. Each Fund's total expenses were also compared with those of its Expense
Group. The Board noted its objective to limit each Fund's total expense ratio to
an acceptable range as compared to the median of the Expense Group. The
following paragraphs summarize the expense results for the Funds and the Board's
view of such expenses.

Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee was in the quartile with
the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group and its total expenses were in
the quartile with the lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board was
satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in comparison
to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee and total expenses were
in the quartile with the lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board was
satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in comparison
to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee was in the quartile with
the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group and its total expenses were in
the quartile with the second highest of its Expense Group. The Board gave
favorable consideration to the Fund's management fee, but noted that the Fund's
total expenses were not in line with the Board's objective. In evaluating the
total expenses, the Board considered management's plans to implement an expense
cap as of June 1, 2005. The Board was satisfied with management's efforts to
improve the Fund's total expense ratio and bring it in line with the Board's
objective.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee and total expenses were
in the quartile with the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board
was satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in
comparison to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee and total expenses were
in the quartile with the lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board was
satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in comparison
to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc. -- The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee and total expenses were
in the quartile with the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board
was satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in
comparison to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board considered the level of profits, if any,
realized by Delaware Investments in connection with the operation of the Funds.
In this respect, the Board reviewed the Investment Management Profitability
Analysis that addressed the overall profitability of Delaware Investments'
business in providing management and other services to each of the individual
funds and the Delaware Investments Family of Funds as a whole. Specific
attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating costs for the
purpose of determining profitability. Management stated that the level of
profits of Delaware Investments, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by Delaware Investments. The Board considered
Delaware Investments' expenditures to improve services provided to fund
shareholders and to meet additional regulatory and compliance requirements
resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and recent SEC initiatives. The Board also
considered the extent to which Delaware Investments might derive ancillary
benefits from fund operations, including the potential for procuring additional
business as a result of the prestige and visibility associated with its role as
service provider to the Delaware Investments Family of Funds, the benefits from
allocation of fund brokerage to improve trading efficiencies and the use of
"soft" commission dollars to pay for proprietary and non-proprietary research.
At the Board's request, management also provided information relating to
Delaware Investments' profitability by client type. The information provided set
forth the revenue, expenses and pre-tax income/loss attributable to the Delaware
Investments Family of Funds, Delaware Investments' separate account business and
other lines of business at Delaware Investments. Emphasis was given to the level
and type of service provided to the various clients. The Board was satisfied
with the level of profits realized by Delaware Investments from the
relationships with the Funds and the Delaware Investments Family of Funds.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. As closed-end funds, the Funds do not issue shares on a
continuous basis. Fund assets increase only to the extent that the value of the
underlying securities in the Fund increase. Accordingly, the Board determined
that the Funds were not likely to experience significant economies of scale due
to asset growth and, therefore, a fee schedule with breakpoints to pass the
benefit of such economies of scale on to shareholders was not likely to provide
the intended effect.
