Muni Intermediate Duration
Fund, Inc.


Annual Report
May 31, 2004


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders
with high current income exempt from Federal income taxes by
investing primarily in a portfolio of municipal obligations, the
interest on which, in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer, is
exempt from Federal income taxes.

This report, including the financial information herein, is
transmitted to shareholders of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.
for their information. It is not a prospectus. The Fund has
leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain leveraged by
issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for
Common Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater
volatility of net asset value and market price of shares of the
Common Stock, and the risk that fluctuations in the short-term
dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect the yield to Common
Stock shareholders. Past performance results shown in this report
should not be considered a representation of future performance.
Statements and other information herein are as dated and are subject
to change.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to
determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is

Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek
to enhance the yield and net asset value of its Common Stock.
However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all interest rate
environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which
pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests
the proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on
these investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to
Common Stock shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of
these portfolio holdings is reflected in the per share net asset
value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to benefit
Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively
sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-
term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If
either of these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will
begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock
capitalization of $100 million and the issuance of Preferred
Stock for an additional $50 million, creating a total value of
$150 million available for investment in long-term municipal bonds.
If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3% and
long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million
of Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At
the same time, the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the
income based on long-term interest rates. Of course, increases in
short-term interest rates would reduce (and even eliminate) the
dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term
investments, and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the
beneficiaries of the incremental yield. However, if short-term
interest rates rise, narrowing the differential between short-term
and long-term interest rates, the incremental yield pickup on the
Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At the same
time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its
price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a result,
decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price
of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the fund's
Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in
net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in
certain securities whose potential income return is inversely
related to changes in a floating interest rate ("inverse floaters").
In general, income on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term
interest rates increase and increase when short-term interest rates
decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of
reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested
principal. In addition, inverse floaters have the effect of
providing investment leverage and, as a result, the market value
of such securities will generally be more volatile than that of
fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the
net asset value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than
if the Fund did not invest in such securities. As of May 31, 2004,
none of the Fund's net assets were invested in inverse floaters.


Swap Agreements


The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-
counter contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic
payments based on the change in market value of a specified bond,
basket of bonds, or index in return for periodic payments based on a
fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market value of a
different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be
used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk
that the party with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will
default on its obligation to pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund
will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to
the agreement.

A Letter From the President


Dear Shareholder

For the six-month and 12-month periods ended May 31, 2004, the
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index posted respective returns
of -.22% and -.03%. Its taxable counterpart, the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Bond Index, returned +.60% for the six-month period and
- -.44% for the 12-month period ended May 31, 2004. Amid considerable
month-to-month volatility, tax-exempt bond yields rose over the past
year, generally mimicking the movement of U.S. Treasury yields.
Given their tax-exempt status, however, municipal bonds continued to
be an attractive fixed income investment alternative.

By May month-end, the Federal Reserve Board appeared poised to raise
the Federal Funds target rate from its 45-year low of 1%. This
anticipated shift in monetary policy was largely prompted by better-
than-expected employment reports for the months of March, April and
May, as well as by rising producer prices. The good news on the
employment front - previously a dim spot in an otherwise bright
economic picture - helped cause the yield on the 10-year Treasury
bond to spike 75 basis points (.75%), from 3.91% on April 1 to 4.66%
on May 28.

Equity markets, in the meantime, gleaned support from the improving
economic environment and provided attractive returns. Although we
did experience a market correction toward the end of the period,
for the six months and 12 months ended May 31, 2004, the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index returned +6.79% and +18.33%, respectively.
Significant fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2003, including low
interest rates and tax cuts, opened the door to consumer spending,
capital spending, increases in exports and long-awaited job growth.
As expected, these developments led the way to improvements in
corporate earnings - a positive for stock markets.

The events and efforts of the past year leave us with a much
stronger economy today. Of course, markets will always fluctuate,
and there are many uncertainties - including the possibility of
geopolitical events - that can translate into negative market
movements. Keeping this in mind, however, we encourage you to
revisit your portfolio and your asset allocation strategy to ensure
you are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that
lie ahead. Importantly, your financial advisor can help you develop
a strategy most suitable for your circumstances through all types of
market and economic cycles.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with
your investment assets, and we look forward to serving you in the
months and years ahead.



Sincerely,



(Terry K. Glenn)

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager


We maintained the portfolio's defensive stance throughout the
period, as we believe this positioning readies the Fund for relative
outperformance once interest rates begin to rise.


Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Amid considerable volatility, yields on long-term fixed
income securities moved higher over the past 12 months as bond
prices - which move opposite of yields - fell. The rise in bond
yields was largely driven by robust economic activity and long-
awaited job growth.

At the start of the period, bond yields declined (and prices rose)
as the Federal Reserve Board lowered short-term interest rates
in order to bolster the then sputtering U.S. economic activity. Long-
term U.S. Treasury bond yields had fallen to their recent historic
low of 4.17% by mid-June 2003. As economic growth gained steam,
yields rose (and prices declined) dramatically until again turning
downward on continued reports of lackluster job growth. The trend
reversed once more in early April 2004 when a surprisingly strong
monthly employment report triggered fears that the long-
accommodative Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates
sooner than many had expected. As a result, bond yields rose (prices
fell) for the remainder of the period.

At the end of May, long-term bond yields had risen to 5.35%, an
increase of nearly 100 basis points (1.00%) over the 12-month
period. Ten-year U.S. Treasury note yields ended May at 4.65%,
an increase of more than 125 basis points during the past year.
Tax-exempt bond yields generally mimicked the movement of their
taxable counterparts, although volatility in the municipal market
was more subdued. Long-term revenue bond yields, as measured by the
Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, rose approximately 55 basis points
during the past 12 months. For the same period, yields on AAA-rated
issues maturing in 30 years rose approximately 65 basis points to
4.99% while yields on 10-year, AAA-rated issues increased more than
80 basis points to nearly 3.95%, according to Municipal Market Data.

The more marked increase in 10-year bond yields may be attributed to
the fact that recent issuance has been heavily concentrated in the
10-year - 20-year range. The resulting supply imbalance prompted
higher intermediate bond yields (and lower prices). Longer-maturity
and lower-rated issues continued to benefit from more favorable
supply/demand factors and, therefore, have seen less price
depreciation. Overall, in the past 12 months, nearly $385 billion
in long-term tax-exempt bonds was issued, comparable to the prior
year's issuance. In more recent months, however, the pace of
underwriting has quickened. More than $92 billion in long-term
municipal obligations was marketed in the past three months, an
increase of more than 12.5% compared to the same period a year ago.

While investor enthusiasm for stocks has taken some attention away
from fixed income markets, overall demand for tax-exempt municipal
bonds has remained positive. Recent Federal Reserve Board statistics
showed that U.S. household holdings of municipal securities
increased by more than $25 billion during the fourth quarter of 2003
to approximately $680 billion.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the
existing market conditions?

Since inception (August 1, 2003) through May 31, 2004, the Common
Stock of Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized
yields of 5.93% and 6.58%, based on a period-end per share net
asset value of $14.52 and a per share market price of $13.10,
respectively, and $.720 per share income dividends. Over the same
period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was
+6.09%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $14.33
to $14.52, and assuming reinvestment of $.648 per share ordinary
income dividends.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, the total investment
return on the Fund's Common Stock was +.62%, based on a change in
per share net asset value from $14.88 to $14.52, and assuming
reinvestment of $.432 per share income dividends.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2004, the Fund's Auction
Market Preferred Stock (AMPS) had an average yield of .91%.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, since inception
through May 31, 2004 lagged the +7.01% average return of the Lipper
General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the same
period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These
funds can be leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or
reverse repurchase agreements.)



MUNI INTERMEDIATE DURATION FUND, INC., MAY 31, 2004



Since its inception, we have positioned the Fund to be less
sensitive to interest rate changes than the average longer-maturity,
closed-end, leveraged municipal bond fund. Given the historically
low interest rate environment, our goal was to seek to protect the
Fund's net asset value from any negative price impact associated
with an eventual rise in interest rates. While this strategy
resulted in a lower relative total return than the Lipper category,
in a period generally characterized by falling interest rates (since
the Fund's inception on August 1, 2003) we believe it effectively
positions the Fund for relative outperformance when interest rates
ultimately head higher. In fact, we expect long-term interest rates
to rise in the coming months.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a
change in the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as
measured by the trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York
Stock Exchange), and assuming reinvestment of dividends, please
refer to the Financial Highlights section included in this report.
As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a
result, total investment returns based on changes in the market
value of the Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total
investment returns based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


How have you managed the Fund since its inception?

The Fund commenced operations on August 1, 2003, and we quickly
achieved a fully invested portfolio. Our strategy aims to provide a
lower-duration alternative to longer-maturity, closed-end, leveraged
funds. To that end, we invested the portfolio's assets predominantly
in 15-year - 20-year bonds and a combination of lower investment
grade and non-investment grade securities. Given the relative
steepness of the municipal yield curve, we felt longer intermediate
maturities (15 years - 20 years) represented the greatest value in
the high-grade municipal market. For example, purchasing bonds that
mature in 2023 captures 95% of the yield on the curve while avoiding
the significant duration risk associated with longer-dated bonds.

In our view, the lower investment grade and non-investment grade
securities represented value, given the historically wide credit
spreads that had existed for some time and the possibility that
these spreads would narrow significantly with an improving economy.
In fact, this contraction in spreads occurred, causing lower credit
quality issues to significantly outperform the broader municipal
market.

Since its inception, the Fund's borrowing costs generally remained
in the .85% - 1.15% range. These attractive funding levels, in
combination with the steep municipal yield curve, continued to
generate significant income to the Fund's Common Stock shareholders.
Currently, the Federal Reserve Board appears poised to begin raising
short-term interest rates. The increase, however, is expected to be
gradual and should not have a material impact on the positive
advantage leverage has had on the Fund's Common Stock yield.
However, should the spread between short-term and long-term interest
rates narrow, the benefits of leveraging will decline and, as a
result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common Stock. At the end of
the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to AMPS, was 34.04% of
total net assets. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits
and risks of leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the
period?

We remained fully invested at the close of the period and
defensively structured. In our opinion, the economy is on track for
continued growth, which we expect should push interest rates higher
over time. Therefore, the portfolio's defensive positioning should
ultimately serve to benefit relative performance.

We believe credit spreads will continue to narrow, although not at
the same pace seen in the last several months. Nevertheless, we
expect that the Fund's position in lower-quality issues should
continue to make a positive contribution to performance.

Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-
diversified, closed-end management investment company. Prior to
commencement of operations on August 1, 2003, the Fund had no
operations other than those relating to organizational matters and
the sale of 6,981 shares of Common Stock on July 17, 2003 to Fund
Asset Management, L.P. ("FAM") for $100,003. The Fund's financial
statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which may require the use of management
accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication
the net asset value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's
Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol MUI. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments--Municipal bonds are traded primarily
in the over-the-counter markets and are valued at the last available
bid price in the over-the-counter market or on the basis of yield
equivalents as obtained by the Fund's pricing service from one or
more dealers that make markets in the securities. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are
valued at their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges.
Options written or purchased are valued at the last sale price in
the case of exchange-traded options. In the case of options traded
in the over-the-counter market, valuation is the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap
agreements are valued by quoted fair values received daily by the
Fund from the counterparty. Short-term investments with a remaining
maturity of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value. Securities and assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund, including valuations furnished by a pricing
service retained by the Fund, which may utilize a matrix system for
valuations. The procedures of the pricing service and its valuations
are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general
supervision of the Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various
portfolio investment strategies both to increase the return of the
Fund and to hedge, or protect, its exposure to interest rate
movements and movements in the securities markets. Losses may arise
due to changes in the value of the contract or if the counterparty
does not perform under the contract.

* Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell
financial futures contracts and options on such futures contracts.
Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities
at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon
entering into a contract, the Fund deposits and maintains as
collateral such initial margin as required by the exchange on which
the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund
agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal
to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or
payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund
as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the
value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
time it was closed.

* Options--The Fund may write covered call options and purchase call
and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of
an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or
deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
(or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option
expires (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund
realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums
received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Forward interest rate swaps--The Fund may enter into forward
interest rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and
the counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a specified
notional contract amount, commencing on a specified future effective
date, unless terminated earlier. When the agreement is closed, the
Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount equal to the value
of the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


(c) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income tax
provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security
transactions are recorded on the dates the transactions are entered
into (the trade dates). Realized gains and losses on security
transactions are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates. Interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all premiums and
discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment
income are declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains
are recorded on the ex-dividend dates.

(f) Reclassification--U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
require that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect
permanent differences between financial and tax reporting.
Accordingly, during the current year, $20,538 has been reclassified
between undistributed net investment income and accumulated realized
capital gains on investment as a result of permanent differences

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund
Asset Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is
Princeton Services, Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML & Co."), which is the
limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain
other services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such
services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .55% of
the Fund's average daily net assets, including proceeds from the
issuance of Preferred Stock. FAM has contractually agreed to waive a
portion of its fee during the first seven years of the Fund's
operations ending July 31, 2010, as follows:

                                               Fee Waiver
                                            (As a Percentage
                                            of Average Daily
                                              Net Assets)

Years 1 through 5                                  .15%
Year 6                                             .10%
Year 7                                             .05%
Year 8 and thereafter                              .00%


FAM has not agreed to waive any portion of its fee beyond July 31,
2010.

For the period August 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004, FAM earned fees of
$3,761,844, of which $1,256,455 was waived.

During the period August 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004, Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), an affiliate of
FAM, received underwriting fees of $2,850,000 in connection with the
issuance of the Fund's Preferred Stock.

For the period August 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004, the Fund reimbursed
FAM $13,027 for certain accounting services.

MUNI INTERMEDIATE DURATION FUND, INC., MAY 31, 2004



Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited)


The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required
by Federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock
otherwise elects, all dividend and capital gains distributions will
be automatically reinvested by EquiServe (the "Plan Agent"), as
agent for shareholders in administering the Plan, in additional
shares of Common Stock of the Fund. Holders of Common Stock who
elect not to participate in the Plan will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of
record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name
then to such nominee) by EquiServe, as dividend paying agent. Such
participants may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive
all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash by sending
written instructions to EquiServe, as dividend paying agent, at the
address set forth below. Participation in the Plan is completely
voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
penalty by written notice if received by the Plan Agent not less
than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently
declared dividend or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains
distribution (collectively referred to as "dividends") payable
either in shares or in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the
equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired
by the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon
the circumstances described below, either (i) through receipt of
additional unissued but authorized shares of Common Stock from the
Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding
shares of Common Stock on the open market ("open-market purchases")
on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If on the payment date
for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common Stock
is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common
Stock plus estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being
referred to herein as "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest
the dividend amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the
participant. The number of newly issued shares of Common Stock to
be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value
per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the
maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the
date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If on the dividend payment date
the net asset value per share is greater than the market value (such
condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the Plan
Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf
of the participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the
Plan Agent will have until the last business day before the next
date on which the shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no
event more than 30 days after the dividend payment date (the "last
purchase date") to invest the dividend amount in shares acquired in
open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund will pay
monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which open-
market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date
on the dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date,
which typically will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its open-market purchases, the market price of
a share of Common Stock exceeds the net asset value per share,
the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may
exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in
newly issued shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the
foregoing difficulty with respect to open-market purchases, the
Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period
or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market
purchases and will invest the uninvested portion of the dividend
amount in newly issued shares at the close of business on the last
purchase date determined by dividing the uninvested portion of the
dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the account,
including information needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares
in the account of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan
Agent in non-certificated form in the name of the participant, and
each shareholder's proxy will include those shares purchased or
received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares
held pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the
participants.



MUNI INTERMEDIATE DURATION FUND, INC., MAY 31, 2004



In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees
which hold shares of others who are the beneficial owners, the
Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of
shares certified from time to time by the record shareholders as
representing the total amount registered in the record shareholder's
name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued
directly by the Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains
distributions payable either in shares or in cash. However, each
participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases in
connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not
relieve participants of any Federal, state or local income tax that
may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not
available to shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the
market price plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the
net asset value, participants in the Plan will receive shares of
the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and will
have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market
price plus commissions is below the net asset value, participants
will receive distributions in shares with a net asset value greater
than the value of any cash distribution they would have received on
their shares. However, there may be insufficient shares available in
the market to make distributions in shares at prices below the net
asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem shares, the price
on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be
excluded from gross income to the extent that the cash amount
reinvested would be excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's
shares are trading at a premium over net asset value, the Fund
issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a greater fair market
value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible that all or
a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable
distribution. If the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution,
it is also possible that the taxable character of this discount
would be allocable to all the shareholders, including shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable
share of the discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the
Plan. There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan;
however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a
service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Agent at EquiServe, P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010,
Telephone: 800-426-5523.

Item 3(c)(4) of Form N-CSR.

Ms. Hodrick has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
accounting principals, financial statements, and internal controls
and procedures for financial reporting. Ms. Hodrick earned a Ph.D.
in economics and has taught courses in finance for over 15 years.
Her M.B.A.-level course centers around the evaluation and analysis
of firms' corporate financial statements. She has also taught in
financial analysts' training programs. Ms. Hodrick has also worked
with several prominent corporations in connection with the analysis
of financial forecasts and projections and analysis of the financial
statements of those companies, serving on the Financial Advisory
Council of one of these major corporations. She has also served as
the Treasurer and Finance Chair of a 501(c)(3) organization. Ms.
Hodrick has published a number of articles in leading economic and
financial journals and is the associate editor of two leading
finance journals.

M. Colyer Crum also possesses a thorough understanding of generally
accepted accounting principals, financial statements, and internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting through a
combination of education and experience.  Professor Crum was a
professor of investment management at the Harvard Business School
for 25 years.  The courses taught by Professor Crum place a heavy
emphasis on the analysis of underlying company financial statements
with respect to stock selection and the analysis of credit risk in
making loans.  Professor Crum has also served on a number of boards
of directors and has served on the audit committees, and in some
cases chaired the audit committee, for several major corporations
and financial institutions.  For two such organizations, Professor
Crum has performed extensive investment analysis of financial
statements in connection with investment management decisions.  From
these experiences, he has gained significant experience with the
establishment of reserves and accounting policies, differences
between U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP and executive compensation
issues.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has
adopted policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of
services.  Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided

provided to the registrant's affiliated service providers that
relate directly to the operations and the financial reporting of the
registrant.  Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee
believes are a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules
and b) routine and recurring services that will not impair the
independence of the independent accountants may be approved by the
Committee without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis
("general pre-approval").  However, such services will only be
deemed pre-approved provided that any individual project does not
exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for the
project as a whole.  Any proposed services exceeding the pre-
approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the
Committee, as will any other services not subject to general pre-
approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).  The
Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board
meeting.

controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-
approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

Item 6 - Schedule of Investments - Not Applicable

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for
Closed-End Management Investment Companies -

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill
Lynch Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P.
(the "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to
the Fund's portfolio securities.  The Investment Adviser has adopted
policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to
the voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in
the account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund.
Pursuant to these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's
primary objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting
decisions solely in the best interests of each Fund and its
shareholders, and to act in a manner that the Investment Adviser
believes is most likely to enhance the economic value of the
securities held by the Fund.  The Proxy Voting Procedures are
designed to ensure that that the Investment Adviser considers the
interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the interests
of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real (or
perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
properly addressed and resolved.

In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee").  The
Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment
professionals appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and
investment analysts appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the
CIO deems appropriate.  The Committee will also include two non-
voting representatives from the Investment Adviser's Legal
department appointed by the Investment Adviser's General Counsel.
The Committee's membership shall be limited to full-time employees
of the Investment Adviser.  No person with any investment banking,
trading, retail brokerage or research responsibilities for the
Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a member of the
Committee or participate in its decision making (except to the
extent such person is asked by the Committee to present information
to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser
might be asked to do so).  The Committee determines how to vote the
proxies of all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy
voting authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that
all votes are consistent with the best interests of those clients
and are free from unwarranted and inappropriate influences.  The
Committee establishes general proxy voting policies for the
Investment Adviser and is responsible for determining how those
policies are applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each
issuer's unique structure, management, strategic options and, in
certain circumstances, probable economic and other anticipated
consequences of alternate actions.  In so doing, the Committee may
determine to vote a particular proxy in a manner contrary to its
generally stated policies.  In addition, the Committee will be
responsible for ensuring that all reporting and recordkeeping
requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires
a case-by-case determination.  In such cases, the Committee may
elect not to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that
issue.  The Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting
issues require investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and
other significant corporate transactions - akin to investment
decisions, and are, therefore, not suitable for general guidelines.
The Committee may elect to adopt a common position for the
Investment Adviser on certain proxy votes that are akin to
investment decisions, or determine to permit the portfolio manager
to make individual decisions on how best to maximize economic value
for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment decisions made by
such portfolio managers).  While it is expected that the Investment
Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which the
Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in
conjunction with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the
Fund's specific circumstances require that its proxies be voted
differently.

To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee
has retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS").  ISS is an
independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
institutional investors.  The services provided to the Investment
Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
(although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping.  ISS will also
assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
obligations under the Investment Company Act.

The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address
special circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy
voting.  For instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the
Investment Adviser generally will not seek to vote proxies related
to portfolio securities that are on loan, although it may do so
under certain circumstances.  In addition, the Investment Adviser
will vote proxies related to securities of foreign issuers only on a
best efforts basis and may elect not to vote at all in certain
countries where the Committee determines that the costs associated
with voting generally outweigh the benefits.  The Committee may at
any time override these general policies if it determines that such
action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote
proxies in respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment
Adviser (each, an "Affiliate"), or a money management or other
client of the Investment Adviser (each, a "Client") is involved.
The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment Adviser's adherence
to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts of
interest.  The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy
Voting Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving
Affiliates and Clients.  If, however, an issue representing a non-
routine matter that is material to an Affiliate or a widely known
Client is involved such that the Committee does not reasonably
believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if the particular
proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes
of ensuring that an independent determination is reached, retain an
independent fiduciary to advise the Committee on how to vote or to
cast votes on behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients.

In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an
independent fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an
independent fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a
subcommittee, appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary
of the Committee), consisting solely of Committee members selected
by the CIO.  The CIO shall appoint to the subcommittee, where
appropriate, only persons whose job responsibilities do not include
contact with the Client and whose job evaluations would not be
affected by the Investment Adviser's relationship with the Client
(or failure to retain such relationship).  The subcommittee shall
determine whether and how to vote all proxies on behalf of the
Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is, in their
judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the applicable
portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee determines to
alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines or, on
matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case, does
not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service or
other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies
relating to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the
Secretary's absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee
concurs that the subcommittee's determination is consistent with the
Investment Adviser's fiduciary duties

In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain
recurring proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual
circumstances.  These policies are guidelines only, and the
Investment Adviser may elect to vote differently from the
recommendation set forth in a voting guideline if the Committee
determines that it is in a Fund's best interest to do so.  In
addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any time upon the
request of a Committee member and may be amended or deleted upon the
vote of a majority of Committee members present at a Committee
meeting at which there is a quorum.

The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
respect to the following proxy issues:

* Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of
issuers other than investment companies.  As a general matter, the
Committee believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than
shareholders) is most likely to have access to important, nonpublic
information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is
therefore best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee
management.  The Committee, therefore, believes that the foundation
of good corporate governance is the election of qualified,
independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of
the corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder
value over time.  In individual cases, the Committee may look at a
nominee's history of representing shareholder interests as a
director of other companies or other factors, to the extent the
Committee deems relevant.

* Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent
auditors.  As a general matter, the Committee believes that
corporate auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests
of shareholders and provide an independent view on the propriety of
financial reporting decisions of corporate management.  While the
Committee will generally defer to a corporation's choice of auditor,
in individual cases, the Committee may look at an auditors' history
of representing shareholder interests as auditor of other companies,
to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

* Proposals related to management compensation and employee
benefits.  As a general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of
an issuer's compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive
compensation, but believes that compensation matters are normally
best determined by an issuer's board of directors, rather than
shareholders.  Proposals to "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation
practices or to set arbitrary restrictions on compensation or
benefits will, therefore, generally not be supported.

* Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for
approval of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital
structure.  As a general matter, the Committee will support requests
that enhance the rights of common shareholders and oppose requests
that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

* Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an
issuer's charter or by-laws.  As a general matter, the Committee
opposes poison pill provisions.

* Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
corporate meetings.

* Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings
of investment company shares.  As with other types of companies, the
Committee believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its
shareholders) is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee
management.  However, the Committee opposes granting Boards of
Directors authority over certain matters, such as changes to a
fund's investment objective, that the Investment Company Act
envisions will be approved directly by shareholders.

* Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner
that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns.
The Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings
are inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and
opposes shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or
requesting release of information that would not help a shareholder
evaluate an investment in the corporation as an economic matter.
While the Committee is generally supportive of proposals to require
corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and material to
the economic interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally
not supportive of proposals to require disclosure of corporate
matters for other purposes.
