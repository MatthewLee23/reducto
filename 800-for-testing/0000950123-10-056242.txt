                                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members' capital, including the schedule of investments, and
the related statements of operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") at March 31, 2010, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years
in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments at March 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
investment funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statement March 31, 2010
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy  Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability company on April 6, 2004 under the laws
of the  State of  Delaware  and is  registered  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to generate consistent capital appreciation over
the long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will
seek to accomplish this objective by allocating its assets primarily among  professionally  selected  investment funds ("Investment
Funds") that are managed by experienced  third-party  investment advisers ("Portfolio Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a corporation  formed under the laws of the State of
Delaware and an affiliate of JPMorgan  Chase & Co.  ("JPMorgan  Chase"),  is  responsible  for the  allocation of assets to various
Investment  Funds,  subject to policies  adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited
liability  company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  "Managing  Member"),  serves as the managing  member of the
Fund. The Managing Member is registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  ("CFTC") and is
a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC,  Inc., a  corporation  formed under the laws of the State of New York and an affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the
special member of the Fund (the "Special Member"). The Special Member is entitled to all incentive-based  performance  allocations,
if any, from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP")  requires the  Investment  Manager to make  estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the Investment  Manager as of the last day of each month in
accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board. The Fund's  investments in the Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and can only be redeemed  periodically.
The Board has  approved  procedures  pursuant to which the Fund  values its  investments  in  Investment  Funds at fair  value.  In
accordance with these procedures, fair value as of each month-end ordinarily is the net asset value determined as of such month-end
for each  Investment  Fund in  accordance  with the  Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies and reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.


                                                                                                                                 10

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund as determined by the Investment Manager represents
the amount that the Fund could  reasonably  expect to receive from an Investment  Fund if the Fund's  interest were redeemed at the
time of the valuation,  based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Investment Manager
believes to be reliable.  In the unlikely event that an Investment  Fund does not report a month-end  value to the Fund on a timely
basis, the Investment Manager would determine the fair value of such Investment Fund based on the most recent value reported by the
Investment  Fund,  as well any other  relevant  information  available  at the time the  Investment  Manager Fund values the Fund's
portfolio.  The values assigned to these  investments are based on available  information and do not necessarily  represent amounts
that might ultimately be realized,  as such amounts depend on future  circumstances  and cannot  reasonably be determined until the
individual investments are actually liquidated.  However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,  those estimated values
may differ  significantly  from the  values  that would have been used had a ready  market  for the  investments  existed,  and the
differences could be significant.

Some of the  Investment  Funds may invest all or a portion of their  assets in  investments  which may be  illiquid.  Some of these
investments  are held in "side  pockets",  sub funds within the  Investment  Funds,  which provide for their  separate  liquidation
potentially over a much longer period than the liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide. Should the Fund seek to
liquidate  its  investment  in an  Investment  Fund  which  maintains  investments  in a side  pocket  arrangement  or which  holds
substantially all of its assets in illiquid securities, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay,
which could be  considerable.  In such cases,  during the period until the Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the
Investment Funds, the value of its investment could fluctuate.

In accordance with the  authoritative  guidance on fair value  measurements and disclosures  under the GAAP, the Fund discloses the
fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that  prioritizes  the inputs to valuation  techniques used to measure the fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would  receive to sell an  investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction with an independent  buyer in the principal  market,  or in the absence of a principal  market,  the most  advantageous
market for the investment or liability.  The guidance establishes a three-tier hierarchy to distinguish between inputs that reflect
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity  (observable  inputs) and inputs that reflect the reporting  entity's own assumptions about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances  (unobservable  inputs) and to establish  classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes.  Various
inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed
below:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment
          speeds, credit risk, etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
          investments)


                                                                                                                                 11

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The inputs or methodology  used for valuing  securities are not  necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in
those securities.  The guidance  requires that the Fund must determine whether there has been a significant  decrease in the volume
and level of activity for an asset or liability  when compared with normal market  activity for such asset or liability (or similar
assets or liabilities).  The Fund must also provide guidance on identifying  circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards
to such an asset or liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider inputs and valuation techniques used for
each major category of securities  with "major  category" being defined as major security type. The Fund has reviewed this activity
and has  determined  it did not have a  material  impact on the Fund's  March 31,  2010  Schedule  of  Investments.  For assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, the Fund must provide quantitative disclosures about the

CREDIT

Portfolio  Managers  utilizing  this  strategy  invest  in debt  and  equity  securities  of  companies  in  financial  difficulty,
reorganization  or  bankruptcy,  nonperforming  and  subperforming  bank loans,  and emerging  market debt.  Portfolios are usually
concentrated in debt instruments.  The Portfolio Managers differ in their preference for actively  participating in the workout and
restructuring process and the extent to which they use leverage.  Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30
- - 180 day redemption notice periods.


                                                                                                                                 13

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

Investment Funds representing approximately 28 percent of the fair value of the investments in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining  approximately 72 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing
in the future or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

LONG/SHORT EQUITIES

Portfolio  Managers  utilizing this strategy make long and short  investments in equity securities that are deemed by the Portfolio
Managers to be under or  overvalued.  The Portfolio  Managers  typically do not attempt to neutralize  the amount of long and short
positions  (i.e.,  they will be net long or net short).  The  Portfolio  Managers may  specialize  in a particular  industry or may
allocate holdings across industries.  Although the strategy is more commonly focused on U.S. markets, a growing number of Portfolio
Managers invest globally. Portfolio Managers in this strategy usually employ a low to moderate degree of leverage. Investment Funds
within this strategy are generally subject to 30 - 90 day redemption notice periods.  Investment Funds representing approximately 5
percent  of the  fair  value of the  investments  in this  strategy  are in side  pockets  or  liquidating  trusts.  The  remaining
approximately  95 percent of the Investment  Funds have either  initial  redemption  dates  commencing in the future or they can be
redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

MERGER ARBITRAGE/EVENT DRIVEN

Portfolio  Managers utilizing this strategy invest in securities of companies  involved in mergers,  acquisitions,  restructurings,
liquidations,  spin-offs,  or other special  situations  that alter a company's  financial  structure or operating  strategy.  Risk
management and hedging techniques are typically employed by the Portfolio Managers to protect the portfolio from deals that fail to
materialize. In addition, accurately forecasting the timing of a transaction is an important element affecting the realized return.
The use of leverage varies.  Investment Funds within this strategy are generally  subject to 60 - 90 day redemption notice periods.
Investment Funds representing  approximately 8 percent of the fair value of the investments in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining  approximately 92 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing
in the future or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

OPPORTUNISTIC/MACRO

Portfolio  Managers  utilizing  this strategy  invest in a wide variety of  instruments  using a broad range of  strategies,  often
assuming an aggressive risk posture. Most Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy rely on a combination of macro-economic models
and fundamental research to invest across countries, markets, sectors and companies, and have the flexibility to invest in numerous
financial  instruments.  Futures and options are often used for hedging and speculation in order to quickly position a portfolio to
profit from changing markets. The use of leverage varies considerably.  Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject
to 45 - 90 day redemption  notice  periods.  All of the  Investment  Funds in this strategy have either  initial  redemption  dates
commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.


                                                                                                                                 14

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

RELATIVE VALUE

Portfolio  Managers  utilizing  this  strategy make  simultaneous  purchases  and sales of similar  securities  to exploit  pricing
differentials.  The Portfolio  Managers  attempt to neutralize  long and short  positions to minimize the impact of general  market
movements.  Different relative value strategies include convertible bond arbitrage,  statistical  arbitrage,  pairs trading,  yield
curve arbitrage and basis trading. The types of instruments traded vary considerably  depending on the Portfolio Manager's relative
value strategy.  Because the strategy attempts to capture relatively small mispricings between two related securities,  moderate to
substantial  leverage is often employed to produce attractive rates of return.  Investment Funds within this strategy are generally
subject to 45 - 90 day redemption notice periods.  Investment Funds representing  approximately 16 percent of the fair value of the
investments in this strategy are in side pockets or liquidating  trusts.  The remaining  approximately 84 percent of the Investment
Funds have either  initial  redemption  dates  commencing  in the future or they can be  redeemed  with no  restrictions  as of the
measurement date.

SHORT SELLING

Portfolio  Managers  utilizing this strategy invest in short positions in companies with  unfavorable  prospects in order to profit
from declining security prices. Short sellers perform best in declining markets and therefore can be useful in a multi-manager fund
to help reduce the fund's total exposure to general stock market movements.  The Portfolio  Managers use a range of fundamental and
technical investment  methodologies to identify short candidates,  may or may not remain fully invested, and use varying degrees of
leverage.  Some Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy assume long positions while remaining net short. Investment Funds within
this strategy are generally subject to 45 day redemption notice periods.  Investment Funds representing  approximately 4 percent of
the fair value of the  investments  in this strategy are in side pockets or  liquidating  trusts.  The remaining  approximately  96
percent of the  Investment  Funds have either  initial  redemption  dates  commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with no
restrictions as of the measurement date.

The redemption  restriction for side pockets and liquidating trusts has been in place for at least six months and the time at which
the redemption restriction might lapse cannot be estimated.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions  received,  whether in the form of cash or  securities,  are applied as a  reduction  of the  investment's  cost when
identified by the Investment Fund as a return of capital.  Once the investment's  cost is received,  any further  distributions are
recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Realized gains and losses
from Investment Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified cost basis.  Investments are recorded on the effective date of
the subscription in the Investment  Fund. All changes in the value of the Investment Funds are included as unrealized  appreciation
or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.


                                                                                                                                 15

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business other than those that the Investment Manager assumes. The expenses of the Fund
include,  but are not limited to, the following:  all costs and expenses  related to investment  transactions and positions for the
Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value; costs of
insurance;  registration  expenses;  expenses of meetings of the Board and  Members;  all costs with respect to  communications  to
Members; and other types of expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund  intends to operate and has  elected to be treated as a  partnership  for federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no
provision for the payment of federal, state or local income taxes has been provided. Each Member is individually required to report
on its own tax return its distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

The  Investment  Manager  evaluates  tax positions  taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing  the Fund's  financial
statements to determine  whether the tax positions are  "more-likely-than-not"  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to meet the "more-likely-than-not"  threshold would be recorded as a
tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Investment Manager's  conclusions regarding tax positions will be subject to review
and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including,  but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and
interpretations thereof.

The Investment  Manager has determined that the adoption of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,  which sets forth a minimum
threshold for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, will
not have a material impact to the Fund's financial  statements.  However, the Investment Manager's conclusions regarding Accounting
for  Uncertainty  in Income Taxes may be subject to review and  adjustment at a later date based on on-going  analyses of tax laws,
regulations and interpretations  thereof and other factors. Each of the Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal years
remains subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

G. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash represents cash and cash equivalents held at PFPC Trust Company ("PFPC Trust"), the Fund's custodian.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration  for such management  services,  the Fund pays the
Investment  Manager a monthly  management  fee equal to 0.1042%  (approximately  1.25% on an  annualized  basis) and an  additional
administrative services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis) of end of month Members' Capital.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and Reimbursement  Agreement (the "Expense  Limitation
Agreement"),  dated May 26, 2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if  necessary,  reimburse
expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that the  Agreement  is in place so that the total  operating  expenses of the
Fund (excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses and any extraordinary expenses of the Fund as
well as any Incentive  Allocation) do not exceed 2.30% on an annualized basis of the Fund's net assets as of the end of each month.
Under the Expense Limitation  Agreement,  any waivers or reimbursements made by the Investment Manager will be subject to repayment
by the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or reimbursement is made,  provided that repayment
does not result in the Fund's aggregate  operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense  limitations.  For the year ended March
31, 2010, the Funds' operating expenses did not exceed the expense  limitation.  The Fund did not reimburse the Investment Manager,
and the Investment Manager did not pay for any expenses on the Fund's behalf.

The Fund has entered into an administration  agreement with PNC Global  Investment  Servicing  (U.S.),  Inc.  ("PNC"),  whereby PNC
provides fund  accounting,  investor  services and transfer agency  functions for the Fund. As compensation  for services set forth
herein that are rendered by PNC during the term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PNC an annual fee ranging from 0.035% to 0.075% of
the Fund's average net assets,  with a minimum monthly fee of $6,250 for administration and accounting,  an annual fee of 0.015% of
the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $3,334 for regulatory  administration  services, and an annual fee for
Member services of $150 per Member,  with a minimum monthly fee of $1,000. For the year ended March 31, 2010,  administration  fees
totaled $361,893, of which none were waived.

PFPC Trust serves as custodian of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for services,  the
Fund pays PFPC Trust an annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average gross assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $795.

The Independent Directors are each paid an annual retainer of $10,000 plus reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in consideration for
their attendance at meetings of the Board, and any committees thereof, and other services they may provide to the Fund.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time,  the Fund may borrow  cash from a major  institution  under a credit  agreement  up to a maximum of $8  million.
Interest is payable on any  outstanding  balance at PRIME plus Margin (0.00%) or LIBOR plus Margin  (1.85%).  During the year ended
March 31, 2010, the Fund had average borrowings outstanding of approximately $2,200,000 at an average interest rate of 2.08%. There
was a loan payable  outstanding  on March 31, 2010 in the amount of  $1,850,000.  Credit  facility fees incurred for the year ended

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

At March 31, 2010,  the estimated cost of investments  for Federal income tax purposes was  substantially  the same as the cost for
financial  reporting  purposes.  Accordingly,  gross  unrealized  appreciation on investments was $21,794,960 and gross  unrealized
depreciation was $7,182,461, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $14,612,499.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial and additional  subscription for interests by eligible  investors may be accepted at such times as the Fund may
determine.  The Fund  reserves  the right to reject any  subscriptions  for  interests  in the Fund.  The  initial  acceptance  for
subscriptions  for Interests was August 1, 2004 (the "Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial Closing Date, the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written tenders by members. These repurchases will be made
at such times,  and in such amounts,  and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole  discretion.  The Investment
Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets  quarterly,  effective as of the last day of March,  June,  September,  and December.  A 1.5%
repurchase fee payable to the Fund will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the day immediately
preceding the one-year  anniversary of a Member's  purchase of its  Interests.  For the year ended March 31, 2010, the fund charged
repurchase fees totaling $31,388 to Members.

At the end of each  Allocation  Period of the Fund,  any net capital  appreciation  or net capital  depreciation  of the Fund (both
realized and  unrealized),  as the case may be, is allocated to the capital  accounts of all of the Members  (including the Special
Member and the Managing Member) in proportion to their respective  opening capital account balances for such Allocation Period. The
initial "Allocation Period" began on the Initial Closing Date, with each subsequent  Allocation Period beginning  immediately after
the close of the  preceding  Allocation  Period.  Each  Allocation  Period closes on the first to occur of (1) the last day of each
month, (2) the date  immediately  prior to the effective date of (a) the admission of a new Member or (b) an increase in a Member's
capital contribution, (3) the effective date of any repurchase of Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year,  each Member's  return on investment for the year is determined and a portion of the net capital
appreciation  allocated to each  Member's  capital  account  during the year (the  "Performance  Allocation"),  net of the Member's
allocable share of the Management Fee and the Manager Administrative  Services Fee, equal to 10% of the portion of such net capital
appreciation that exceeds the Preferred Return (as defined below) will be reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member.
The  "Preferred  Return" is equal to the 3-month  U.S.  Treasury  Bill yield (as defined  below) for each month during the relevant
calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).  The "3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth
of the annual yield for the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill for the first business day of the then current calendar quarter as set forth
in the U.S. Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities",  or if such measurement
is not available, such other source as the Managing Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.


                                                                                                                                 18

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

Prior to April 1, 2005 the performance  allocation was calculated in the following manner: (1) net capital  appreciation up to a 6%
return remains allocated to each Member (the "Preferred Return"); (2) net capital appreciation in excess of the Preferred Return is
reallocated to the Special Member until it has been allocated the next 0.30% of return (the "Catch-Up"); and (3) thereafter, 95% of
any net capital appreciation in excess of the Preferred Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member, and the remaining
5% of such net capital appreciation is reallocated to the Special Member.

No  Performance  Allocation  is made,  however,  with  respect to a Member's  capital  account  until any  cumulative  net  capital
depreciation previously allocated to such Member's capital account plus any Management Fees and Manager Administrative Service Fees
charged to such  capital  account (the "Loss  Carryforward")  have been  recovered.  Any Loss  Carryforward  of a Member is reduced
proportionately to reflect the repurchase of any portion of that Member's Interest. Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at
the end of a calendar year) from a Member, a Performance  Allocation will be determined and allocated to the Special Member, and in
the case of any  repurchase  of a partial  Interest,  on a "first in - first out" basis (i.e.,  the portion of the  Interest  being
repurchased and the amount with respect to which the Performance  Allocation is calculated)  will be deemed to have been taken from
the first capital contribution of such Member (as such contribution has been adjusted for net capital appreciation or depreciation,
Management Fees,  Manager  Administrative  Services Fees and other expenses) until it is decreased to zero and from each subsequent
capital contribution until such contribution (as adjusted) is decreased to zero.

As of December 31, 2009,  $117,764 was reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. An additional $620 was reallocated
to the capital account of the Special Member on March 31, 2010 resulting from Members tendering interests for repurchase as of such
date.  Based upon profits for the period  January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010, the additional  Performance  Allocation  that would be
reallocated to the Special Member is $40,191. This amount is subject to change as Performance  Allocations occur at the end of each
calendar year.

7. RISK EXPOSURE

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into
various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short-selling activities, writing
option contracts,  contracts for differences, and interest rate, credit default and total return equity swaps contracts. The Fund's
risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the value of the investments in the Funds.

In pursuing its  investment  objectives,  the Fund invests in Investment  Funds that are not  registered  under the 1940 Act. These
Investment Funds may utilize diverse investment strategies, which are not generally managed against traditional investment indices.
The Investment  Funds selected by the Fund will invest in and actively trade  securities and other  financial  instruments  using a
variety of strategies and investment  techniques that may involve  significant  risks.  Such risks arise from the volatility of the
equity,  fixed income,  commodity and currency  markets,  leverage both on and off balance sheet associated with borrowings,  short
sales  and  derivative  instruments,  the  potential  illiquidity  of  certain  instruments  including  emerging  markets,  private
transactions,  derivatives, and counterparty and broker defaults. Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Fund,
including risks


                                                                                                                                 19

7. RISK EXPOSURE (CONTINUED)

relating to the  multi-manager  structure of the Fund,  risks relating to  compensation  arrangements  and risks related to limited
liquidity of the units. The Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually,  and may be subject
to various lock-up provisions and early withdrawal fees.

The  investments  of the  Investment  Funds are subject to normal  market  fluctuations  and other risks  inherent in  investing in
securities and there can be no assurance that any  appreciation  in value will occur.  The value of investments can fall as well as
rise and investors may not realize the amount that they invest.

Although the  Investment  Manager will seek to select  Investment  Funds that offer the  opportunity  to have their shares or units
redeemed within a reasonable  timeframe,  there can be no assurance that the liquidity of the investments of such Investment  Funds
will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests as, and when, made.

The  Investment  Manager may invest the Fund's  assets in  Investment  Funds that invest in illiquid  securities  and do not permit
frequent withdrawals. Illiquid securities owned by Investment Funds are riskier than liquid securities because the Investment Funds
may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment  performance  deteriorates,  or may be able to dispose of
the illiquid  securities only at a greatly reduced price.  Similarly,  the illiquidity of the Investment Funds may cause Members to
incur  losses  because of an  inability  to  withdraw  their  investments  from the Fund  during or  following  periods of negative
performance.

The Investment Funds may invest in the securities of foreign companies that involve special risks and  considerations not typically
associated  with  investing in U.S.  companies.  These risks include  devaluation of currencies,  less reliable  information  about
issuers,  different  securities  transaction  clearance  and  settlement  practices,  and future  adverse  political  and  economic
developments.  Moreover,  securities of many foreign  companies and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile
than those securities of comparable U.S. companies.

The Investment Funds may also invest in derivatives which represent agreements between the Investment Fund and a counterparty. Such
agreements,  which include forward  contracts,  non-exchange-traded  options and swaps,  usually represent an agreement between two
parties to either receive or pay monies equal to the difference between a selective value or market rate and/or corresponding value
or market value  ("Reference  Rates") upon the termination of an agreement.  Such transactions can be effected on a leveraged basis
which may amplify the positive or negative outcome of the change in Reference Rates.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of  representations  that provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be
made against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

BOARD APPROVAL OF CONTINUANCE OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

The Board met in person on November 12, 2009 for the purpose of, among other  things,  considering  whether it would be in the best
interests of the Fund and the Members to approve the continuance of the investment  management  agreement  between the Fund and the
Investment  Manager (the "Investment  Management  Agreement") for a one year period from December 1, 2009. At the November 12, 2009
Board meeting, and for the reasons described below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, unanimously approved the
continuance of the Investment Management Agreement for a one year period from December 1, 2009.

In determining  whether to approve the  continuance of the  Investment  Management  Agreement,  the Board  considered,  among other
factors,  the nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided by the  Investment  Manager,  the  performance of the Fund, the
profitability of the Fund to the Investment  Manager and information  about economies of scale. In considering  these factors,  the
Board requested and reviewed a variety of information.

In considering the nature,  extent and quality of the services to be provided by the Investment Manager, the Directors reviewed the
services that the  Investment  Manager  provides to the Fund.  The  Directors  acknowledged  that the Fund is registered  under the
Investment  Company Act of 1940 and allocates its assets primarily among Investment Funds that are managed by third party Portfolio
Managers who employ a range of investment  techniques and strategies.  The Investment  Manager's services to the Fund have included
investment  management  services,  including  the selection and  monitoring of Investment  Funds and Portfolio  Managers and direct
investments in certain other instruments;  maintaining  appropriate  accounts for the Fund's assets; and instructing certain of the
Fund's  service  providers in  connection  with the Fund's  investments.  The  Investment  Manager's  services  also have  included
administrative services,  including providing office space and other support services;  maintaining and preserving certain records;
preparing and filing various materials relating to the Investment Manager with state and U.S. federal regulators; and reviewing and
arranging for payment of the Fund's expenses.  The Directors  considered,  among other things, the Investment Manager's management,
personnel,  resources,  and capabilities  and experience in investing  through third party Portfolio  Managers.  The Directors also
considered the Investment Manager's supervision of the Fund's service providers and its attention to the compliance programs of the
Fund, the Investment Manager and certain other service providers.

The  Directors  reviewed the  investment  performance  of the Fund since  inception  and compared  that  performance  to the Fund's
investment objective, the performance of certain indices and the Investment Manager's performance expectations.

The Directors  considered the cost to the Investment  Manager of the Investment  Management  Agreement and the profitability to the
Investment Manager and its affiliates of the relationship with the Fund over various time periods.  The information provided to the
Directors  indicated that the  profitability to the Investment  Manager and its affiliates  arising from the Investment  Management
Agreement has not been excessive.  The Directors acknowledged certain benefits to the reputations of the Investment Manager and the
Fund from their association with each other.


                                                                                                                                 27

The Directors considered services provided by other advisers to funds having investment objectives and policies similar to those of
the Fund. The Board received,  among other things,  comparative data with respect to various types of fund expenses.  The Directors
received  information  regarding  the fees paid by other funds managed by the  Investment  Manager that had  investment  objectives
similar to that of the Fund.  The Directors took into account  information  provided by the  Investment  Manager about  differences
between the Fund and those accounts,  including with respect to incentive or performance  fees or  allocations.  In considering the
extent of the fees received by the Investment Manager for providing  services to the Fund, the Directors  evaluated factors such as
the fees and expenses borne by other registered funds in the market pursuing strategies  generally similar to those followed by the
Fund. The Directors considered the Fund's historical management fees, its anticipated expense ratio, and various components of that
expense ratio, along with its historical performance allocations.

The Directors,  in considering economies of scale, reviewed information showing that the Fund had increased in size since inception
but had not yet reached the asset level set out in the Investment Manager's original long-term projections.

The materials and other  information  described  above were  considered by the Board,  and also were  considered  separately by the
Independent Directors. The Directors did not identify any particular information or any single factor that was controlling,  or the
particular weight any Director placed on any one factor for purposes of determining  whether to vote in approval of the continuance
of the Investment Management Agreement.  The summary set out above describes the most important factors, but not all of the matters
considered by the Directors in coming to their decision regarding the Investment Management Agreement.

                 J.P. MORGAN ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Objective

J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. ("JPMAAM"), an investment adviser
registered with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and an affiliate of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  ("JPMC"),  is responsible  for the allocation of assets on
behalf of its clients to various private investment funds, including hedge funds
and other  alternative  investment  pools that are structured as private limited
partnerships,    limited   liability   companies   or   offshore    corporations
(collectively,  "Alternative  Investments").  The voting  rights of  Alternative
Investments  generally  are  contract  rights  set  forth in the  organizational
documents (e.g., the limited  partnership  agreement,  Limited Liability Company
agreement or  memorandum  and  articles of  association).  As  privately  placed
securities,  Alternative Investments generally are not subject to the regulatory
scheme applicable to public companies.  Consequently, in most cases, Alternative
Investments  do not issue  proxies.  Instead,  they often solicit  consents from
their limited partners, members or shareholders.

As an investment manager, JPMAAM, in the normal course of business, is typically
granted  by its  clients  the  authority  to vote the  proxies  or  consents  of
Alternative  Investments  (and very  rarely,  proxies  for  securities  that are
received as a result of in-kind  redemptions from Alternative  Investments).  In
accordance  with the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers
Act"),  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974,  as  amended
("ERISA"),  and other applicable  fiduciary and regulatory  standards,  JPMAAM's
objective  is to vote  the  solicitations,  consents  and  proxies  (hereinafter
referred to as "proxies") in the best interests of its clients.  To further that
objective, JPMAAM has adopted these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.

The Proxy Voting Process

1.   VOTING IN GENERAL.  JPMAAM's Portfolio  Management Group ("PMG") as part of
     its ongoing analysis of client holdings monitors  significant  developments
     relating to the portfolio of Alternative Investments.  Situations may arise
     in which more than one client invests in the same Alternative Investment or
     securities.   BECAUSE  IN  THE  CONTEXT  OF  ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS  EACH
     SOLICITED VOTE RAISES UNIQUE  QUESTIONS AND IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF JPMAAM'S
     INVESTMENT  PROCESS,  EACH  PROXY OR OTHER  SOLICITATION  WITH  RESPECT  TO
     ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS WILL BE ANALYZED BY A MEMBER OR MEMBERS OF PMG ON A
     CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

     As a  result,  JPMAAM  may cast  different  votes on  behalf  of  different
     clients.
<PAGE>

2.   RESPONSIBILITY  FOR VOTE FOR ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS - PRIMARY CONTACT FOR
     THE MANAGER OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGE FUND OR OTHER PERSON IDENTIFIED.  Where
     the proxy being voted is with respect to interests in an  underlying  hedge
     fund ("UHF") owned by a JPMAAM  client over which JPMAAM has  discretionary
     investment  authority,  it  shall  be the  responsibility  of  the  Primary
     portfolio  manager  ("Primary") in PMG responsible for that UHF to vote the
     proxy in a timely manner and otherwise in accordance with these procedures.
     In the absence of the Primary,  the Chief  Investment  Officer shall assign
     such  responsibility  to  another  person  in PMG in  accordance  with  the
     procedures set forth below in this section.

3.   PROCEDURES FOR VOTING PROXIES.  JPMAAM has adopted the following procedures
     in order to  ensure  that all proxy  materials  are  processed  in a timely
     fashion:

          o    All  proxies  and related  materials  should be  received  by, or
               forwarded to, JPMAAM Operations  ("Operations")  and processed by
               the designated person or persons within Operations.
          o    Operations will:
               o    Forward the materials by e-mail to:
                    | |  the Primary for that  UHF/manager,  as well as PMG as a
                         whole; and
                    | |  the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO").
               o    Include in the cover email the following information:
                    | |  name of UHF and manager;
                    | |  name(s)  of  the  JPMAAM  client  portfolio(s)  holding
                         interests in this UHF; and
                    | |  the date and time by which JPMAAM must submit the proxy
                         (the "Voting Deadline").  (This is to allow enough time
                         for the  completed  proxy to be  returned to the issuer
                         prior to the Voting Deadline.)
          o    The CCO will initially  review the proxy material to determine if
               a material  conflict  of interest  exists that would  prevent PMG
               from  voting.  If there is no conflict  of interest  the CCO will
               inform PMG that it may vote the proxy as it determines.  If there
               is a material  conflict of interest,  see Escalation of Conflicts
               of Interest, below.
          o    The Primary,  upon  receiving  approval  from the CCO to vote the
               proxy,  will analyze the proxy  materials  and make a decision on
               how to vote the proxy,  conferring  with other PMG  personnel  if
               appropriate.  The Primary shall promptly communicate via email or
               otherwise in writing the decision as to how to vote each proxy to
               Operations  (by close of  business  on the day  before the Voting
               Deadline,  unless otherwise agreed with Operations),  copying the
               CCO. Once  instructions  are received in a timely manner from the
               Primary,  Operations  shall have  responsibility  for completing,
               executing and submitting the proxy prior to the Voting Deadline.
          o    In some cases,  proxy  materials  may  stipulate how a failure to
               vote the proxy will be interpreted (for example,  proxy materials
               may  stipulate  that a "no"  vote  will be deemed to be a vote in
               favor of the proposal, or that there is no need to submit a proxy
               if there is an intention to vote in favor of a proposal). In such
               cases,  the Primary must still  determine  how to vote the proxy,
               and convey this decision via email or other written communication
               to Operations, as described above. If the proxy materials dictate
               that an actual  written proxy need not be  submitted,  Operations
               shall still  email  PMG's  decision to the UHF and keep a copy of
               that email in its files.


MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Rule 206(4)-6  under the Advisers Act requires that the proxy voting  procedures
adopted and implemented by a registered  investment  adviser include  procedures
that  address  material  conflicts  of  interests  that may  arise  between  the
investment  adviser and its clients  and/or  investors.  Material  conflicts  of
interest may arise when  management  of a JPMAAM client or  prospective  client,
distributor or prospective distributor of its investment management products, or
critical  vendor,  is  soliciting  proxies  and  failure  to  vote in  favor  of
management  may affect  JPMAAM's  relationship  with such company and materially
impact  JPMAAM's  business;  or when a  personal  relationship  between a JPMAAM
officer and management of a company or other proponents of proxy proposals could
impact the voting  decision.  Given  JPMAAM's  position as a subsidiary of JPMC,
material  conflicts of interest can also arise between the interests of JPMC and
JPMAAM's clients.
<PAGE>

ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The CCO is responsible for initially identifying potential material conflicts of
interest. If a potential material conflict of interest is identified by the CCO,
JPMAAM will forward the proxy material to internal and/or  external  counsel for
review. Such counsel will provide their advice on proceeding with the vote. If a
material  conflict of interest is  identified  involving the interests of JPMAAM
and  its  clients  or  investors,  it is  the  responsibility  of  the  CCO,  in
consultation  with senior  management and the Proxy Voting Committee  (described
below) to evaluate the matter and determine the final voting decision.

Depending upon the nature of the material conflict, JPMAAM may elect to take one
or more of the following measures, or other appropriate action:

          | |  removing certain JPMAAM personnel from the proxy voting process;
          | |  "walling off" personnel  with knowledge of the material  conflict
               to ensure that such personnel do not influence the relevant proxy
               vote;
          | |  deferring  the  vote  to a  proxy  voting  service  and  vote  in
               accordance with their recommendation; or
          | |  abstaining from voting the proxy.

The resolution of all potential and actual material conflict issues presented to
senior management will be thoroughly documented.

PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

A Proxy Voting Committee  composed of senior  personnel from Legal,  Compliance,
Risk Management,  PMG and Operations can be convened to provide oversight of the
proxy voting process, when necessary. The purposes of such Committee would be to
(i)  review  general  proxy  voting  matters,  and (ii)  discuss  and  arrive at
conclusions on more controversial proxy voting issues.

RECORDKEEPING

JPMAAM is required to maintain in an easily  accessible place for five (5) years
all records  relating to the proxy  voting  process  (the first two years at the
office of JPMAAM). Those records will be kept by Operations and will include the
following:

          | |  a copy of each  proxy  statement  received  on  behalf  of JPMAAM
               clients;
          | |  a record of each vote cast on behalf of JPMAAM client holdings;
          | |  a copy of all  documents  created by JPMAAM  personnel  that were
               material to making a decision on the voting of client  securities
               or that memorialize the basis of the decision; and
          | |  a  copy  of  each  written  request  by  a  JPMAAM  investor  for
               information on how JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of a client, as
               well as a copy of any  written  response by JPMAAM to any request
               by an investor for  information  on how JPMAAM  voted  proxies on
               behalf of a client.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

     Information  regarding the individuals primarily involved in the management
     of the Fund's  portfolio is set out below.  This information is provided as
     of June 7, 2010.
<PAGE>

     PAUL ZUMMO is Chief  Investment  Officer  and a Managing  Director  of J.P.
     Morgan  Alternative  Asset  Management,  Inc. (the  "Adviser"),  the Fund's
     investment  adviser.  He has  been  with  the  Adviser  since  1994  and is
     responsible for investment analysis,  research, due diligence and portfolio
     management.

     COREY  CASE is Chief  Operating  Officer  and a  Managing  Director  of the
     Adviser.  He has been with the Adviser since January 2001, has an extensive
     background  in  risk  management  and is  responsible  for  the  functional
     oversight of the Risk Management & Quantitative Analysis, Client Solutions,
     Product Development,  Geneva Advisory and Infrastructure  groups within the
     Adviser.

     REMI BOUTEILLE is Deputy Chief Investment  Officer and Director of Research
     and a Managing Director of the Adviser.  He has been with the Adviser since
     2000 and is responsible for investment  analysis,  research,  due diligence
     and portfolio management.

     PIERRE  CHABRAN is a Vice  President of the  Adviser.  He has been with the
     Adviser  since  May  2001  and  is  responsible  for  investment  analysis,
     research,  due diligence and portfolio  management with a focus in Relative
     Value and Opportunistic/Global Macro strategies.

     Pierre Chabran has been primarily responsible for the day to day management
     of the Fund's  portfolio  since early March 2007,  including  selecting the
     investment  funds in which the Fund will invest and  allocating  the Fund's
     assets among those investment  funds.  Since September 2009, Paul Zummo has
     shared responsibility for the day to day management of the Fund's portfolio
     with Pierre Chabran.  Paul Zummo,  Corey Case and Remi Bouteille have final
     decision making authority  regarding the investment funds in which the Fund
     (and the other pooled investment vehicles and accounts which are managed by
     the Adviser ("Other Adviser Accounts")) will be permitted to invest.

     The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by
     the persons named above and  approximate  assets under  management in those
     accounts  as of March 31,  2010.  The  Adviser  does not  manage  any other
     registered investment companies.

Remi Bouteille                     27            $3.63 billion (1)                7                 $1.00 billion

Pierre Chabran                     1             $65 million                      1                 $606 million
</TABLE>

(1)  Of these  assets,  $264  million  across 18  vehicles  are not  subject  to
     advisory fees based on performance.

     Potential  conflicts  of interest may arise  regarding  the  allocation  of
     limited  investment  opportunities to the Fund and Other Adviser  Accounts.
     Some  of  the  Other  Adviser  Accounts  may  have  investment  objectives,
     strategies  and  risks  that  differ  from  that  of  the  Fund.  Different
     investments  may be purchased for the Fund and for Other  Adviser  Accounts
     and the  performance of  investments  purchased by the Fund may differ from
     that of the investments purchased for Other Adviser Accounts.  Transactions
     placed on behalf of Other Adviser  Accounts that are directly or indirectly
     contrary to investment  decisions  made for the Fund may have the potential
     to  adversely  impact the Fund.  The Adviser  has  adopted and  implemented
     policies  and  procedures  to address the  potential  conflicts of interest
     associated with managing  multiple  accounts on behalf of multiple clients.
     The  Adviser  monitors a variety of areas,  including  compliance  with any
     stated  investment  guidelines and  restrictions and the performance of the
     Fund and the Other Adviser  Accounts,  to ensure that each account is being
     managed  appropriately  and in  accordance  with  the  Adviser's  fiduciary
     obligations to all its clients.
<PAGE>

     As  of  March  31,  2010,  the  Adviser's   portfolio  managers  receive  a
     compensation  package made up of a base salary and an annual  discretionary
     bonus.  Discretionary  bonuses  are  closely  tied to a variety of factors,
     including but not limited to, the  investment  performance  of all accounts
     managed by the Adviser, the Adviser's overall business performance, as well
     as the individual portfolio manager's  contribution to that performance and
     the Adviser's  business  generally  including the  education,  training and
     support  of  the  Adviser's  other  personnel.  Discretionary  bonuses  are
     comprised  of a  combination  of mandatory  and  voluntary  bonus  deferral
     programs and a cash component. Mandatory bonus deferral is generally in the
     form of JPMorgan  Chase  stock,  subject to a vesting  period.  For certain
     senior portfolio  managers,  a part of the mandatory deferral amount may be
     allocated among different  investment  choices including one or more pooled
     investment  vehicles  managed  by the  Adviser,  also  subject to a vesting
     period. The voluntary bonus deferral program has various investment choices
     which in prior years included a pooled  investment  vehicle  managed by the
     Adviser.

     As of March 31, 2010, none of the persons involved in the management of the
     Fund's portfolio beneficially owns any interest in the Fund.

                     J.P. MORGAN MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, L.L.C.
      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER


I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics (this "Code") of J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy  Fund,
L.L.C. (the "Fund") applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal
financial  officer,  principal  accounting  officer  or  controller,  or persons
performing  similar  functions  (including in their capacity as officers of J.P.
Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. (the "Investment Manager")),  which as
of the date of  adoption  of this Code are the  persons  named in Exhibit A (the
"Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

         o   honest and  ethical  conduct,  including  the  ethical  handling of
             actual or apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between  personal  and
             professional relationships;

         o   full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in
             reports and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
             Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public
             communications made by the Fund;

         o   compliance  with  applicable  laws  and   governmental   rules  and
             regulations;

         o   the prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of this Code to an
             appropriate person or persons identified in this Code; and

         o   accountability for adherence to this Code.

Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high  standard of business  ethics and
should  be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give  rise to  actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private  interest  interferes  with the interests of, or his/her service to, the
Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his/her family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits as a result of
his/her position or relationship with the Fund.

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and the Investment
Manager's compliance programs and procedures

<PAGE>

are  designed  to  prevent,  or  identify  and  correct,   violations  of  these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures.

         Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and the  Investment  Manager of which the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees.  As a result,  this Code  recognizes
that the Covered  Officers  will, in the normal course of their duties  (whether
formally for the Fund,  the  Investment  Manager,  or for both),  be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that may have different effects
on the  Investment  Manager  and the  Fund.  The  participation  of the  Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
the Fund and the Investment  Manager and is consistent  with the  performance by
the Covered  Officers  of their  duties as  officers  of, or persons  performing
similar  functions  with respect to, the Fund.  Thus, if performed in conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors ("the Board") that the Covered
Officers  may also be  officers  or  employees  of one or more other  investment
companies covered by this Code or other codes.

         Other  conflicts  of interest  are  covered by this Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act or the  Investment  Advisers  Act. The following  list provides  examples of
conflicts of interest under this Code, but Covered  Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the
personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly  before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o   not  use  his/her  personal  influence  or  personal  relationships
             improperly  to  influence  investment  decisions  and/or  financial
             reporting by the Fund  whereby the Covered  Officer  would  benefit
             personally to the detriment of the Fund;

         o   not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,  for the
             individual  personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
             benefit of the Fund; and

         o   complete  on an  annual  basis  the  Fund's  Director  and  Officer
             Questionnaire which requests  information  regarding other business
             affiliations and relationships.

         In  furtherance  of the above,  below are some  examples of conflict of
interest  situations  that should be discussed  with the  designated  compliance
officer  of  the  Investment   Manager  and/or  the  Fund,  as  applicable  (the
"Compliance Officer"). Examples of these include, but are not limited to:

         o   serving as a director on the board of any public or private company
             or not for profit organization;

         o   the  receipt  of any gifts in  excess  of $100  from any  person or
             company  with which the Fund has  current or  prospective  business
             dealings;

         o   the receipt of any  entertainment  from any company  with which the
             Fund has  current or  prospective  business  dealings  unless  such
             entertainment is business related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate
             as to time and place,  and not so frequent as to raise any question
             of

<PAGE>

             impropriety or other formulation as the Fund may already use in any
             other code of conduct;

         o   any  ownership   interest  in,  or  any  consulting  or  employment
             relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers,  other than
             its Investment Manager, principal underwriter, administrator and/or
             any affiliated person thereof; and

         o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
             charges  or  spreads  paid  by the  Fund  for  effecting  portfolio
             transactions  or for  selling  or  redeeming  shares  other than an
             interest  arising from the Covered  Officer's  employment,  such as
             compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o   Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
             disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund.

         o   Each Covered  Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
             others to  misrepresent,  facts  about the Fund to others,  whether
             within or outside the Fund,  including to the Fund's  directors and
             auditors,  and/or to  governmental  regulators and  self-regulatory
             organizations.

         o   Each  Covered  Officer  should,  to the extent  appropriate  within
             his/her area of  responsibility,  consult  with other  officers and
             employees of the Fund and the  Investment  Manager with the goal of
             promoting  full,   fair,   accurate,   timely  and   understandable
             disclosure  in the reports and  documents  the Fund files with,  or
             submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications made by the
             Fund.

         o   It is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to  promote
             compliance   with  the  standards  and   restrictions   imposed  by
             applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o   upon  adoption  of this Code (or  thereafter  as  applicable,  upon
             becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board, within
             a reasonable period of time, that he or she has received, read, and
             understands this Code;

         o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
             with the requirements of the Code;

         o   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer and/or any employee
             of  the  Fund  or  affiliated  persons  for  reports  of  potential
             violations that are made in good faith; and

         o   notify the  Compliance  Officer  promptly if he or she knows of any
             violation of this Code.

         Failure to comply  with the  foregoing  is itself a  violation  of this
Code.

<PAGE>

         The  Compliance  Officer  is  responsible,  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations in which questions are presented relating to this Code. The
Compliance  Officer has the authority to interpret  this Code in any  particular
situation. However, any waivers sought by any Covered Officer will require prior
review  and  approval  by the Board  (including,  to the extent  required  under
applicable law, a majority of the independent directors of the Board).

         The Fund will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

         o   the  Compliance  Officer  (or his or her  designee)  will  take all
             appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported
             to him or her;

         o   if, after such investigation,  the Compliance Officer believes that
             no violation has occurred,  the Compliance  Officer is not required
             to take any further action;

         o   any matter the Compliance  Officer  believes to be a violation will
             be  reported  by the  Compliance  Officer  to the Board  which will
             consider appropriate action,  which may include:  review of, and/or
             appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and procedures;
             notification to appropriate  personnel of the Investment Manager or
             its board;  and/or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;
             and

         o   the Board (including,  to the extent required under applicable law,
             a majority  of the  independent  directors  of the  Board)  will be
             responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies  or  procedures  of  the  Fund,  the  Investment   Manager,   principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code. The Fund's and the Investment Manager's codes of ethics
under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act are separate requirements that
may apply to the Covered Officers and others, are not part of this Code, and are
not superceded in any way by this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
the independent directors.  Any amendments to Exhibit A must be disclosed to the
Board at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code
will  be  considered   confidential   and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone.

<PAGE>

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         This Code is intended  solely for internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.


REVISED: MAY 11, 2007
