CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for the Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund Inc., for the period ending October 31, 2004. The
report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments, and
its audited financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income, and its
secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation. In seeking to accomplish
both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad mix of equity securities of
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks out real estate securities that are
attractively priced relative to their historical growth rates and the valuation
of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.


Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.  Portfolio Commentary

     For the fiscal year ending October 31, 2004, on a Net Asset Value (NAV)
     basis, the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX:
     NRO) provided a 19.30% return, compared to a gain of 29.95% for the NAREIT
     Equity REIT Index.

     The Fund trailed its benchmark as a result of timing issues more than
     property sector or stock selection. The Fund commenced investment
     operations on October 31, 2003. During its initial investing period, which
     covered November 1, 2003 to January 31, 2004, the NAREIT index surged
     almost 13%. Because we were not fully invested until February, we could not
     capitalize on this strong market performance. However, the Fund's portfolio
     is well diversified across property sectors and geographic regions. It is,
     we believe, well positioned to provide improved relative performance moving
     forward.

     Over the 12-month reporting period, the REIT market was very strong,
     primarily due to improving economic conditions, a benign interest rate
     environment, and improving real estate fundamentals. As the economy gained
     traction, demand and occupancy levels for commercial real estate also
     increased. In addition, investors continued to emphasize companies with
     visible earnings, which benefited the REIT market.

     Among REIT sectors, regional malls, shopping centers, and industrial
     properties did particularly well. Retailers also performed well, as they
     continued to expand over the past year, causing occupancy and rent levels
     to increase. Healthy consumer spending levels also contributed to
     retailers' strong performance. Industrial REITs generated good returns
     primarily due to core improvements in parts of the U.S. economy.

     On the other hand, REITs that own office properties performed less well.
     Office properties underperformed due to concerns about oversupply and
     modest expansion plans. Apartment sector underperformance resulted from the
     low-interest-rate environment, encouraging first time home buyers to become
     more active.

     As we look out to 2005, we see continued improvement in the U.S. economy
     and improving fundamentals for most types of real estate, albeit with
     expectations for higher interest rates. Our general outlook for REITs
     remains favorable and we believe that demand for REITs has the potential to
     remain robust.

     Sincerely,

                               /s/ Steven R. Brown

                                 STEVEN R. BROWN

     Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There
     is an initial public offering and once issued, common shares of closed-end
     funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

     +    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate
          Securities Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest
          sales price where that price is readily available; securities for
          which no sales were reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at
          the last available bid price. Securities traded primarily on the
          NASDAQ Stock Market are normally valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ
          Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided by NASDAQ each business day.
          The NOCP is the most recently reported price as of 4:00:02 p.m.,
          Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of the "inside"
          bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that dealers
          quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
          case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked
          price, whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the
          NOCP may not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before
          the market closes. The Fund values all other securities by a method
          the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") believes accurately
          reflects fair value. Numerous factors may be considered when
          determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
          media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the
          issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
          outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by independent
          quotation services and expressed in local currency values. Foreign
          security prices are translated from the local currency into U.S.
          dollars using the exchange rate as of 12:00 noon, Eastern time. The
          Board has approved the use of FT Interactive Data Corporation ("FT
          Interactive") to assist in determining the fair value of the Fund's
          foreign equity securities in the wake of certain significant events.
          When changes in the value of a certain index suggest that the closing
          prices on the foreign exchanges no longer represent the amount that
          the Fund could expect to receive for those securities, FT Interactive
          will provide adjusted prices for certain foreign equity securities
          based on an analysis showing historical correlations between the
          prices of those securities and changes in the index. In the absence of
          precise information about the market values of these foreign
          securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board
          has determined on the basis of available data that prices adjusted in
          this way are likely to be closer to the prices the Fund could realize
          on a current sale than are the prices of those securities established
          at the close of the foreign markets in which the securities primarily
          trade. However, fair value prices are necessarily estimates, and there
          is no assurance that such a price will be at or close to the price at
          which the security next trades. Short-term debt securities with less
          than 60 days until maturity may be valued at cost which, when combined
          with interest earned, approximates market value.

     #    At cost, which approximates market value.

     ##   At October 31, 2004 the cost of investments for U.S. Federal income
          tax purposes was $770,671,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of
          investments was $67,213,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of
          investments was $7,448,000, resulting in net unrealized appreciation
          of $59,765,000, based on cost for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

     @    Neuberger Berman Institutional Cash Fund ("Institutional Cash") is
          also managed by Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (see Notes A and E of
          Notes to Financial Statements) and may be considered an affiliate
          since it has the same officers, Board members, and investment manager
          as the Fund and because, at times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the
          outstanding voting securities of Institutional Cash.

     ~    All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
          Financial Statements).

     ++   The N&B Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Quality Fund") is an
          investment vehicle established by the Fund's custodian to invest cash
          the Fund receives as collateral for securities loans. The Fund's
          shares in the Quality Fund are non-voting. However, because all shares
          of the Quality Fund are held by funds in the related investment
          company complex, the Quality Fund may be considered an affiliate of
          the Fund (see Notes A and E of Notes to Financial Statements).

     +++  All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for
          interest rate swap contracts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
          "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as
          a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
          Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund
          had no operations until October 31, 2003, other than matters relating
          to its organization and the sale on September 26, 2003 of 6,981 shares
          of common stock for $100,003 ($14.325 per share) to Neuberger Berman,
          LLC ("Neuberger"), the Fund's sub-adviser. The Board of Directors of
          the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any unissued shares
          of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred stock without
          the approval of shareholders.

          The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
          generally accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman
          Management Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at
          the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
          those estimates.

     2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in
          the notes following the Schedule of Investments.

     3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions
          are recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
          ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if
          any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received.
          Interest income, including accretion of original issue discount, where
          applicable, and accretion of discount on short-term investments, is
          recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from
          securities transactions and foreign currency transactions are recorded
          on the basis of identified cost and stated separately in the Statement
          of Operations.

     4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to
          qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
          requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
          to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all
          of its earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income or
          excise tax provision is required.

          Income dividends and capital gain distributions are determined in
          accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
          generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are
          primarily due to differing treatments of income and gains on various
          investment securities held by the Fund, timing differences and
          differing characterization of distributions made by the Fund as a
          whole.

          As determined on October 31, 2004, permanent differences resulting
          primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
          excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
          reclassified at year end. These reclassifications had no effect on net
          income, net assets or net assets per share of the Fund.

                                       13

          The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October
          31, 2004 and the one day ended October 31, 2003 were as follows:

</Table>

          As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings
          (accumulated losses) on a U.S. Federal income tax basis were as
          follows:

                 INCOME                     GAIN            (DEPRECIATION)          AND DEFERRALS              TOTAL
          <S>                      <C>                      <C>                     <C>                     <C>
          $          --            $          --            $   60,975,449          $          --           $ 60,975,449
</Table>

          The difference between book basis and tax basis distributable earnings
          is attributable primarily to timing differences of dividend payments,
          wash sales and income recognized on interest rate swaps.

     5    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income,
          net of expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of the
          Fund to declare quarterly and pay monthly distributions to common
          shareholders. The Fund has adopted a policy to pay common shareholders
          a stable distribution. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution
          amount, distributions may consist of net investment income, realized
          gains and paid-in capital. The Fund may pay distributions in excess of
          those required by its stable distribution policy to avoid excise tax
          or to satisfy the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
          Code. Income dividends and capital gain distributions to common
          shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net realized
          capital gains, if any, will be offset to the extent of any available
          capital loss carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the level
          of the stable distribution paid by the Fund. Dividends and
          distributions to preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as
          described in Note A-7.

          The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities
          issued by real estate companies, including real estate investment
          trusts ("REITs"). The distributions received from REITs held by the
          Fund are generally comprised of investment income, long-term capital
          gains, and return of REIT capital but the REITs do not report this
          information to the Fund until the following calendar year. At October
          31, 2004, the Fund estimated these amounts within the Statement of
          Operations since the information is not available from the REITs until
          after the Fund's fiscal year end. The character of distributions paid
          to shareholders, as disclosed within the Statement of Changes, is
          based on these estimates. All estimates are based upon REIT
          information sources available to the Fund together with actual IRS
          Forms 1099 received to date. After calendar year-end, REITs often
          recharacterize the nature of the distributions paid during that year,
          frequently with the result that distributions previously identified as
          income are recharacterized as return of capital and/or capital gain.
          After all applicable REITs have informed the Fund of the actual
          breakdown of distributions paid to the Fund during its fiscal year,
          the Fund adjusts to actual, estimates previously recorded. As a
          result, the composition of the Fund's distributions as reported herein
          may

                                       14
<Page>

          differ from the final composition determined after calendar year-end
          and reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099.

          On September 29, 2004, the Fund declared two monthly dividends to
          common shareholders from its net investment income in the amount of
          $0.10 per share per month, payable after the close of the reporting
          period, on November 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004, to shareholders of
          record on November 12, 2004 and December 15, 2004, respectively, with
          ex-dividend dates of November 10, 2004 and December 13, 2004,
          respectively.

     6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
          Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
          Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
          includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which
          Management serves as investment manager, that are not directly
          attributed to the Fund, are allocated among the Fund and the other
          investment companies in the complex or series thereof, on the basis of
          relative net assets, except where a more appropriate allocation of
          expenses to each investment company in the complex or series thereof
          can otherwise be made fairly.

     7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund
          re-classified 12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A
          Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred
          Shares, Series C Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction
          Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued
          2,450 Series A AMPS, 2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and
          2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
          per share plus any accumulated unpaid dividends, whether or not earned
          or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation
          Value").

          Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, dividends to
          preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and
          paid every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for
          Series C and Series D AMPS. Dividend rates are reset every 7 days for
          Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D
          AMPS based on the results of an auction, except during special rate
          periods. For the year ended October 31, 2004, dividend rates ranged
          from 1.06% to 1.95% for Series A, 1.05% to 1.95% for Series B, 1.07%
          to 1.95% for Series C and 1.09% to 1.87% for Series D AMPS. The Fund
          declared dividends to preferred shareholders for the period November
          1, 2004 to November 30, 2004 of ($98,147, $100,514, $103,100 and
          $104,165) for Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D AMPS,
          respectively.

          The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business
          day preceding any dividend payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund
          is also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS. Failure
          to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from
          declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing
          common shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at
          Liquidation Value. The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per
          share and will vote with holders of common stock as a single class,
          except that the AMPS will vote separately as a class on certain
          matters, as required by law or the Fund's charter. The holders of the
          AMPS, voting as a separate class, are

                                       15
<Page>

          entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect
          a majority of the Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay
          dividends on AMPS for two consecutive years.

     8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
          transactions, with institutions that the Fund's investment manager has
          determined are creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in
          short-term interest rates could reduce common share net earnings as a
          result of leverage. Under the terms of the interest rate swap
          agreements, the Fund agrees to pay the swap counter party a fixed-rate
          payment in exchange for the counter party's paying the Fund a
          variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all or a portion
          of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's AMPS. The
          fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against each
          other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
          monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a
          value at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any
          swap transaction, marked to market daily.

          Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to
          comply with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the
          failure of a counter party is generally limited to the net interest
          payment to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at
          the end of the contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements
          in interest rates unanticipated by Management.

          Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the
          swaps are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along
          with the fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the
          swaps. The unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic
          interim net interest payments are reclassified to realized
          gains/losses in conjunction with the actual net receipt or payment of
          such amounts. At October 31, 2004, the fund had outstanding interest
          rate swap contracts as follows:

          (1) 30 day LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)

     9    SECURITY LENDING: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the
          Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund entered into a Securities
          Lending Agreement ("Agreement") with Neuberger. Securities loans
          involve certain risks in the event a borrower should fail financially,
          including delays or inability to recover the lent securities or
          foreclose against the collateral. The investment manager, under the
          general supervision of the Board, monitors the creditworthiness of the
          parties to whom the Fund makes security loans. The Fund will not lend
          securities on which covered call options have been written, or lend
          securities on terms which would prevent the Fund from qualifying as a
          regulated investment company. The Fund receives cash collateral equal
          to at least 102% of the current market value of the loaned securities.
          The Fund invests the cash collateral in the N&B Securities Lending
          Quality Fund, LLC, which is managed by State Street Bank and Trust
          Company ("State Street") pursuant to guidelines approved by the Fund's
          investment manager. Neuberger guaranteed a certain amount of revenue
          to the Fund

                                       16
<Page>

          under the Agreement, and received a portion of any revenue earned in
          excess of the guaranteed amount as a lending agency fee. For the year
          ended October 31, 2004, the Fund paid Neuberger $3,580 under the
          Agreement.

          The Agreement has been renewed and approved by the Board as of July 1,
          2004 with substantially the same terms. Under this current Agreement,
          Neuberger guarantees a certain amount of revenue to the Fund and
          receives any revenue earned in excess of the guaranteed amount as a
          lending agency fee.

          Income earned on the securities loaned, if any, is reflected in the
          Statement of Operations under the caption Income from securities
          loaned-affiliated issuer.

     10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements
          with institutions that the Fund's investment manager has determined
          are creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The
          Fund requires that the securities purchased in a repurchase agreement
          be transferred to the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the
          Fund to assert a perfected security interest in those securities in
          the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The Fund
          monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the securities transferred to
          ensure that their value, including accrued interest, is greater than
          amounts owed to the Fund under each such repurchase agreement.

     11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT
          INC.: Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and
          Exchange Commission, the Fund may invest in the Neuberger Berman
          Institutional Cash Fund (the "Cash Fund"), a fund managed by
          Management and having the same Board members as the Fund. The Cash
          Fund seeks to provide as high a level of current income as is
          consistent with the preservation of capital and the maintenance of
          liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in the Cash Fund,
          Management waives a portion of its management fee equal to the
          management fee it receives from the Cash Fund on those assets. For the
          year ended October 31, 2004, management fees waived on the Cash Fund
          amounted to $24,476. For the year ended October 31, 2004, income
          earned on this investment amounted to $199,718 and is reflected in the
          Statement of Operations under the caption Income from investments in
          affiliated issuers.

     12   ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay
          all organizational expenses and the amount by which the Fund's
          offering costs for common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03
          per share. There were no costs incurred by Management. Offering costs
          for common stock paid by the Fund were charged as a reduction of
          common stock paid-in-capital at the completion of the Fund's offerings
          and amounted to $775,349.

          Additionally, offering costs of $299,820 and a sales load of
          $2,450,000 incurred through the issuance of AMPS were charged as a
          reduction of common stock paid-in-capital at the completion of the
          Fund's AMPS offering.

          As of October 31, 2004, total offering costs of $120 remain payable by
          the Fund.

                                       17
<Page>

     13   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
          investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
          securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
          non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the
          majority of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing,
          management and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential
          real estate. Values of the securities of such companies may fluctuate
          more due to economic, legal, cultural, geopolitical or technological
          developments affecting the United States real estate industry, or a
          segment of the United States real estate industry in which the Fund
          owns a substantial position, than would the shares of a fund not
          concentrated in the real estate industry.

     14   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
          documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified
          against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
          duties to the Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service
          contracts and in the normal course of its business, the Fund enters
          into contracts that provide indemnifications to other parties for
          certain types of losses or liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure
          under these arrangements is unknown as this could involve future
          claims against the Fund.

          NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
          WITH AFFILIATES:

          The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a
          Management Agreement. For such investment management services, the
          Fund pays Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average
          daily Managed Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the
          Fund, less liabilities other than the aggregate indebtedness entered
          into for purposes of leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed
          Assets, the Liquidation Value of any AMPS outstanding is not
          considered a liability.

          Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the
          management fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the
          following annual rates:

                    2004 - 2008                          0.25%
                       2009                              0.19
                       2010                              0.13
                       2011                              0.07
</Table>

          Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond
          October 31, 2011.

          For the year ended October 31, 2004, such waived fees amounted to
          $1,676,132.

          The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an
          Administration Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration
          fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets
          under this agreement. Additionally, Management retains State Street as
          its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration Agreement. Management
          pays State Street a fee for all services received under the agreement.

                                       18

          On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger, a member firm of the
          New York Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to the Fund, became indirect
          wholly-owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"),
          a publicly-owned holding company. Neuberger is retained by Management
          to furnish it with investment recommendations and research information
          without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals who are officers
          and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of Neuberger and/or
          Management.

          The Fund entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it
          to pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
          commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the
          Fund. Expenses paid through this program may include costs of
          custodial, transfer agency or accounting services. For the year ended
          October 31, 2004, the impact of this arrangement was a reduction of
          $65,482.

          The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
          custodian contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in the
          Statement of Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was a
          reduction of $1,952.

          In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
          through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
          broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the
          AMPS held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding
          a rate period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the
          annual rate of 1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of
          one year or more, the service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the
          Fund and the broker-dealer.

          In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is
          required to provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis
          verifying that the Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a
          discounted value equal to or greater than the AMPS Basic Maintenance
          Amount, which is a minimum level set by each rating agency as one of
          the conditions to maintain the AAA rating on the AMPS. `Discounted
          Value' refers to the fact that the rating agencies require the Fund,
          in performing this calculation, to discount portfolio securities below
          their face value, at a rate depending on their rating. The Fund pays a
          fee to State Street, as Fund sub-administrator, for the preparation of
          this report.

          NOTE C--SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:

          During the year ended October 31, 2004, there were purchase and sale
          transactions (excluding short-term securities and interest rate swap
          contracts) of $1,008,166,000 and $300,482,000, respectively.

          During the year ended October 31, 2004, brokerage commissions on
          securities transactions amounted to $945,610, of which Neuberger
          received $38,175, Lehman received $125,728, and other brokers received
          $781,707.

          the Fund receives as collateral for securities loans. The Fund's
          shares in the Quality Fund are non-voting. However, because all shares
          of the Quality Fund are held by funds in the related investment
          management complex, the Quality Fund may be considered an affiliate of
          the Fund.

     ***  Neuberger Berman Institutional Cash Fund ("Institutional Cash") is
          also managed by Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and may be considered
          an affiliate since it has the same officers, Board members, and
          investment manager as the Fund and because, at times, the Fund may own
          5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of Institutional Cash.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income
Fund Inc., (the "Fund") as of October 31, 2004, and the related statement of
operations for the year ended October 31, 2004, statement of changes in net
assets for the year ended October 31, 2004 and the one day period ended October
31, 2003 (commencement of operations) and financial highlights for the periods
indicated herein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2004, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers or other appropriate auditing
procedures where replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. at October 31, 2004,
the results of its operations for the year ended October 31, 2004, changes in
its net assets for the year ended October 31, 2004 and for the one day period
ended October 31, 2003 (commencement of operations), and its financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (Unaudited)

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

Item 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board has delegated to Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger Berman") the
responsibility to vote proxies related to the securities held in the Fund's
portfolios. Under this authority, Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies related to portfolio securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its stockholders. The Board permits Neuberger Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services, including research of
current issues.

Neuberger Berman has implemented written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy Voting Policy") that are designed to reasonably ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger Berman has voting authority, including the Fund. The Proxy
Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger Berman addresses any conflicts that
may arise between its interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

<PAGE>

Neuberger Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing, authorizing,
implementing and updating the Proxy Voting Policy, overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging and overseeing any independent third-party vendors as
voting delegate to review, monitor and/or vote proxies. In order to apply the
Proxy Voting Policy noted above in a timely and consistent manner, Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final authority and fiduciary responsibility for proxy voting.
Neuberger Berman believes that this process is reasonably designed to address
material conflicts of interest that may arise between Neuberger Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment professional at Neuberger Berman believes that
it is in the best interests of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent with Neuberger Berman's proxy voting guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent with ISS recommendations, the Proxy Committee will review
information submitted by the investment professional to determine that there is
no material conflict of interest between Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy Committee determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment professional presents a material conflict of interest between
Neuberger Berman and the client or clients with respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action, in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance with the proxy voting guidelines or as ISS
recommends; (ii) disclose such conflict to the client or clients and obtain
written direction from the client as to how to vote the proxy; (iii) suggest
that the client or clients engage another party to determine how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another independent third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

         Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
