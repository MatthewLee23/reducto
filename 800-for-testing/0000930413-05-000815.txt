(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
calculated  by  subtracting  the  value  of an  investment  in the  Fund  at the
beginning of each  specified  period from the value at the end of the period and
dividing the  remainder by the value of the  investment  at the beginning of the
period and expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that
all income  dividends  and capital gain  distributions  have been  reinvested at
prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan. Total return does
not reflect broker  commissions  or sales charges.  Total return for a period of
greater than one year  represents the average annual total return.  Total return
for a period of less than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.  Total
return,  price,  yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions.  This data is provided for information  only and is not intended for
trading  purposes.  A portion of the income generated by the Fund may be subject
to  federal,  state  and  local  taxes,  and  may at  times  be  subject  to the
alternative  minimum tax.  Closed-end  funds,  unlike  open-end  funds,  are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized  current monthly
per share dividend payable to common shareholders by the market price per common
share at November 30, 2004.

(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
calculated  by  subtracting  the  value  of an  investment  in the  Fund  at the
beginning of each  specified  period from the value at the end of the period and
dividing the  remainder by the value of the  investment  at the beginning of the
period and expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that
all income  dividends have been  reinvested at prices  obtained under the Fund's
dividend  reinvestment plan. Total return does not reflect broker commissions or
sales charges. Total return for a period of greater than one year represents the
average annual total return.  Total return for a period of less than one year is
not annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative  minimum tax.  Closed-end  funds,  unlike  open-end  funds,  are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized  current monthly
per share dividend payable to common shareholders by the market price per common

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS II NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
November 30, 2004 (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Municipal  Income Fund II ("Municipal  II"),  PIMCO  California  Municipal
Income Fund II ("California  Municipal II") and PIMCO New York Municipal  Income
Fund II ("New York  Municipal  II")  collectively  referred to as the "Funds" or
"PIMCO  Municipal  Income Funds II", were  organized as  Massachusetts  business
trusts on March 29, 2002.  Prior to commencing  operations on June 28, 2002, the
Funds had no operations  other than matters  relating to their  organization and
registration as closed-end  management investment companies registered under the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940 and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  as
amended.  PA Fund  Management  LLC, (the  "Investment  Manager"),  serves as the
Funds' Investment Manager and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz
Global  Investors of America  L.P.  ("AGI"),  formerly  Allianz  Dresdner  Asset
Management  of America  L.P. AGI is an indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary  of
Allianz  AG. The Funds have an  unlimited  amount of $0.00001  par value  common
stock authorized.

Municipal II invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal
bonds,  the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes.  California
Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds which
pay interest that is exempt from federal and California  state income taxes. New
York  Municipal II invests  substantially  all of its assets in municipal  bonds
which pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York State and New York City
income  taxes.  The Funds will seek to avoid bonds  generating  interest  income
which could  potentially  subject  individuals to  alternative  minimum tax. The
issuers'  abilities  to meet their  obligations  may be affected by economic and
political developments in a specific state or region.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business the Funds enter into  contracts  that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Funds'
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have not
yet been asserted. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be remote.

The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting  policies  consistently
followed by the Funds:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. Portfolio securities and other
financial  instruments for which market  quotations are not readily available or
if a development/event  occurs that may impact the value of the security, may be
fair-valued  in good faith  pursuant to procedures  established  by the Board of
Trustees.  The Funds'  investments  are valued daily by an  independent  pricing
service.  The independent  pricing service uses  information  provided by market
makers or  estimates  of market  values  obtained  from yield data  relating  to
investments or securities with similar  characteristics.  Short-term investments
maturing in sixty days or less are valued at amortized  cost, if their  original
maturity was 60 days or less or by amortizing  their value on the 61st day prior
to maturity,  if the original term to maturity exceeded 60 days. Exchange traded
options,  futures  and  options on futures  are valued at the  settlement  price
determined  by the  relevant  exchange.  The  prices  used by the Funds to value
securities  may differ from the value that would be  realized if the  securities
were sold and the differences could be material to the financial statements. The
Funds net  asset  value is  determined  daily at the  close of  regular  trading
(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the New York Stock Exchange.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt  securities  purchased  are  accreted  or  amortized  daily to  non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(b) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Funds intend to distribute  all of their  taxable  income and to comply with
the other  requirements of the U.S.  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of their taxable  ordinary  income and long-term  capital gains,  if any, during
each  calendar  year,  the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S. federal excise
tax.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(d) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A  futures  contract  is an  agreement  between  two  parties  to buy and sell a
financial  instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract,  the Funds are  required  to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities,  equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts,  the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily  fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such  receipts or payments are known as  "variation  margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation.  When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between
the value of the  contracts  at the time they were  opened  and the value at the
time they were closed. Any unrealized  appreciation or depreciation  recorded is
simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves the risk of an
imperfect  correlation  in the  movements  in the  price of  futures  contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets,  and the possible  inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(e) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
The Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call options for hedging on. The
risk  associated  with  purchasing  an  option  is that the  Funds pay a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Funds bear the risk of
loss of premium and change in market value should the  counterparty  not perform
under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in the same
manner as portfolio  securities.  The cost of  securities  acquired  through the
exercise of call options is increased by the premiums  paid.  The proceeds  from
the  securities  sold  through the  exercise of put options is  decreased by the
premiums paid.

When an option is written,  the premium  received is recorded as a liability and
subsequently  marked to market to reflect the current market value of the option
written. These liabilities are reflected as options written in the Statements of
Assets and  Liabilities.  Premiums  received  from writing  options which expire
unexercised  are  recorded  on the  expiration  date  as a  realized  gain.  The
difference  between the  premium  received  and the amount  paid on  effecting a
closing purchase transaction,  including brokerage commissions,  is also treated
as a realized  gain,  or if the  premium  is less than the  amount  paid for the
closing  purchase  transactions,  as a  realized  loss.  If  a  call  option  is
exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put
option is  exercised,  the premium  reduces the cost basis of the  security.  In
writing an option,  the Funds bear the market risk of an  unfavorable  change in
the price of the security  underlying the written option.  Exercise of an option
written  could result in the Funds  purchasing  a security at a price  different
from the current market price.

(f) RESIDUAL  INTEREST  MUNICIPAL  BONDS  ("RIBS")/RESIDUAL  INTEREST TAX EXEMPT
BONDS  ("RITES") The Funds invest in RIBS and RITES whose interest rates bear an
inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or the value of an
index.  RIBS and RITES are created by dividing the income stream provided by the
underlying bonds to create two securities, one short-term and one long-term. The
interest  rate on the  short-term  component  is reset  by an  index or  auction
process  normally every seven to 35 days. After income is paid on the short-term
securities at current rates,  the residual  income from the  underlying  bond(s)
goes to the long-term  securities.  Therefore,  rising short-term interest rates
result  in  lower  income  for the  longer-term  portion,  and vice  versa.  The
longer-term  bonds may be more  volatile  and less liquid  than other  municipal
bonds of comparable  maturity.  An investment  in RITES  typically  will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

(g) DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON  STOCK The Funds declare dividends from
net  investment  income  monthly to common  shareholders.  Distributions  of net
realized  capital gains, if any, are paid at least  annually.  Each Fund records
dividends and  distributions  to its  shareholders on the ex-dividend  date. The
amount  of  dividends  and  distributions  from net  investment  income  and net
realized  capital gains are  determined in  accordance  with federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted  accounting  principles.
These "book-tax" differences are either considered either temporary or permanent
in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts
are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on their federal income tax
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.  To the extent
dividends  and/or  distributions  exceed  current and  accumulated  earnings and
profits for federal  income tax purposes  they are reported as dividends  and/or
distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(h) CUSTODY CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES
The Funds benefit from an expense offset  arrangement  with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian and
accounting  agent  expenses.  Had these cash  balances  been  invested in income
producing securities, they would have generated income for the Funds.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreements")
with the Investment Manager.  Subject to the supervision by each Fund's Board of
Trustees, the Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or
through  others  selected  by it, the  Fund's  investment  activities,  business
affairs  and other  administrative  matters.  Pursuant  to the  Agreements,  the
Investment  Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly,  at the annual rate
of  0.65%  of each  Fund's  average  daily  net  assets,  including  net  assets
attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding. In order to reduce
Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to reimburse each
Fund for fees and  expenses at the annual  rate of 0.15% of each Fund's  average
daily net assets, including net assets attributable to any preferred shares that
may be outstanding,  from the commencement of operations  through June 30, 2007,
and for a declining amount thereafter through June 30, 2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment Management
Company LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser") to manage each Fund's  investments.  Subject to
the supervision of the Investment Manager,  the Sub-Adviser makes all the Fund's
investment  decisions.  The Investment Manager, and not the Funds pays a portion
of the fees it receives to the  Sub-Adviser  in return for its services,  at the
maximum annual rate of 0.50% of each Fund's  average daily net assets  including
net assets  attributable to any preferred  shares that may be  outstanding.  The
Sub-Adviser  has  contractually  agreed  to  waive a  portion  of the fees it is
entitled to receive from the Investment Manager,  such that the Sub-Adviser will
receive  0.26% of each Fund's  average  daily net assets,  including  net assets
attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be  outstanding,  from  the
commencement of the Funds' operations through June 30, 2007, and will receive an
increasing  amount not to exceed 0.50% of each Fund's  average daily net assets,
including  net  assets   attributable  to  any  preferred  shares  that  may  be
outstanding  thereafter  through June 30, 2009. The Investment  Manager informed
the Funds that it paid the  Sub-Adviser  $1,733,868,  $884,406  and  $305,145 in
connection with sub-advisory  services for Municipal II, California Municipal II
and New York Municipal II,  respectively,  for the six months ended November 30,
2004.

The Funds are subject to certain  limitations and  restrictions  while Preferred
Shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and

triggering  the mandatory  redemption of Preferred  Shares at their  liquidation
value.

Preferred  Shares,  which are  entitled  to one vote per share,  generally  vote

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On September 13, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
announced that the  Investment  Manager and certain of its affiliates had agreed
to a settlement of charges that they and certain of their  officers  had,  among
other things,  violated various antifraud  provisions of the federal  securities
laws in connection with an alleged  market-timing  arrangement involving trading
of shares of various open-end investment companies ("open-end funds") advised or
distributed by the Investment  Manager and certain of its  affiliates.  In their
settlement  with the  Commission,  the Investment  Manager and their  affiliates
consented to the entry of an order by the Commission and,  without  admitting or
denying  the  findings  contained  in the  order,  agreed to  implement  certain
compliance and governance changes and consented to  cease-and-desist  orders and
censures.  In addition,  the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed to pay
civil  money  penalties  in  the  aggregate   amount  $40  million  and  to  pay
disgorgement in the amount of $10 million, for an aggregate payment of

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)
$50 million.  In connection with the settlement,  the Investment Manager and its
affiliates have been dismissed from the related  complaint the Commission  filed
on May 6, 2004 in the U.S.  District Court in the Southern District of New York.
Neither the  complaint  nor the order  alleges any  inappropriate  activity took
place with respect to the Funds.

In a related,  action on June 1, 2004, the Attorney  General of the State of New
Jersey  announced  that it had entered into a settlement  agreement with AGI and
certain  other  affiliates  of the  Investment  Manager,  in  connection  with a
complaint  filed by the New Jersey  Attorney  General  ("NJAG") on February  17,
2004. The NJAG dismissed claims against the Sub-Adviser,  which had been part of
the same complaint.  In the settlement,  AGI and other named affiliates  neither
admitted nor denied the  allegations or conclusions of law, but did agree to pay
New Jersey a civil fine of $15 million and $3 million  for  investigative  costs
and further potential  enforcement  initiatives against unrelated parties.  They
also undertook to implement certain governance  changes.  The complaint relating
to the  settlement  contained  allegations  arising out of the same matters that
were subject of the Commission order regarding market timing described above.

On September 15, 2004, the Commission  announced that the Investment Manager and
certain of its affiliates  agreed to settle an enforcement  action in connection
with  charges that they  violated  various  antifraud  and other  provisions  of
federal  securities  laws as a result of, among other  things,  their failure to
disclose to the board of trustees and  shareholders  of various  open-end  funds
advised or  distributed by the  Investment  Manager and its affiliates  material
facts  and  conflicts  of  interest  that  arose  from  their  use of  brokerage
commissions  on  portfolio  transactions  to pay  for  so-called  "shelf  space"
arrangements  with certain  broker-dealers.  In the  settlement,  the Investment
Manager and its affiliates  consented to the entry of an order by the Commission
without admitting or denying the findings  contained in the order. In connection
with the  settlement,  the  Investment  Manager  and its  affiliates  agreed  to
undertake   certain   compliance  and   disclosure   reforms  and  consented  to
cease-and-desist  orders and censures.  In addition,  the Investment Manager and
these  affiliates  agreed to pay a civil money  penalty of $5 million and to pay
disgorgement  of $6.6  million  based upon the amount of  brokerage  commissions
alleged  to have been  paid by such  open-end  funds in  connection  with  these
arrangements  (and  related  interest).  In a  related  action,  the  California
Attorney  General  announced  on  September  15,  2004  that it had  entered  an
agreement  with an  affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager in  resolution  of an
investigation   into  matters  that  are  similar  to  those  discussed  in  the
Commission's  order. The settlement  agreement resolves matters described in the
compliant filed by the California  Attorney General in the Superior Court of the
State of California  alleging,  among other things, that this affiliate violated
certain  antifraud  provisions of California law by failing to disclose  matters
related to the  shelf-space  arrangements  described  above.  In the  settlement
agreement,  the  affiliate  did not admit to any  liability but agreed to pay $5
million  in civil  penalties  and $4 million in  recognition  of the  California
Attorney  General's fees and costs associated with the investigation and related
matters.  Neither the Commission's  order nor the California  Attorney General's
complaint  alleges any  inappropriate  activity  took place with  respect to the
Funds.

Since  February 2004, the Investment  Manager,  the  Sub-Adviser  and certain of
their  affiliates  have been named as  defendants  in 14 lawsuits  filed in U.S.
District  Court in the Southern  District of New York,  the Central  District of
California  and the  Districts  of New  Jersey  and  Connecticut.  Ten of  those
lawsuits  concern  "market  timing,"  and  they  have  been  transferred  to and
consolidated  for  pre-trial  proceedings  in the U.S.  District  Court  for the
District of Maryland; the remaining four lawsuits concern "revenue sharing" with
brokers offering "shelf space" and have been  consolidated  into a single action
in the U.S.  District Court for the District of  Connecticut.  The lawsuits have
been  commenced as putative  class actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed  shares of  affiliated  funds  during  specified  periods or as
derivative  actions on behalf of the funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the
same facts that are the subject of the regulatory  proceedings  discussed above.
The lawsuits seek,  among other things,  unspecified  compensatory  damages plus
interest  and, in some cases,  punitive  damages,  the  rescission of investment
advisory  contracts,   the  return  of  fees  paid  under  those  contracts  and
restitution.  The  Investment  Manager and the  Sub-Adviser  believe  that other
similar  lawsuits  may be  filed  in U.S.  federal  or state  courts  naming  as
defendants the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser,  AGI, the Funds, other open-
and  closed-end  funds advised or distributed  by the  Investment  Manager,  the
Sub-Adviser  and/or their  affiliates,  the boards of trustees of `those  funds,
and/or other affiliates and their employees.

Under Section 9(a) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, if any of the various
regulatory  proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser,  AGI and/or their affiliates,  they and
their  affiliates  would,  in the  absence of  exemptive  relief  granted by the
Commission,  be barred  from  serving as an  investment  adviser/sub-adviser  or
principal  underwriter  for any  registered  investment  company,  including the
Funds. In connection  with an inquiry from the Commission  concerning the status
of the New Jersey settlement described above under

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

Section 9(a),  the Investment  Manager,  the  Sub-Adviser,  and certain of their
affiliates  (together,  the "Applicants")  have sought exemptive relief from the
Commission  under  Section  9(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of  1940.  The
Commission has granted the Applicants a temporary  exemption from the provisions
of Section 9(a) with respect to the New Jersey  settlement  until the earlier of
(i) September)  13, 2006 and (ii) the date on which the  Commission  takes final
action on their  application for a permanent  order.  There is no assurance that
the Commission will issue a permanent order.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from these
matters  could lead to a decrease  in the market  price of the Funds'  shares or
other adverse  consequences to the Funds and their  shareholders.  However,  the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or on the Investment Manager's or
the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment advisory services
relating to the Funds.

8. CORPORATE CHANGES

On July 29, 2004, Stephen Treadway resigned as the Funds' Chairman. On September
14, 2004, David C. Flattum was appointed to the Board of Trustees and Youse Guia
was named as the Funds' Chief Compliance  Officer. On October 5, 2004, the Board
of Trustees elected Robert E. Connor as Chairman.  On December 14, 2004,  Thomas
J. Fuccillo was appointed as the Funds' Secretary.

*    Commencement of operations
**   Initial  public  offering  price of  $15.00  per  share  less  underwriting

(1)  Total investment  return is calculated  assuming a purchase of common stock
     at the current  market  price on the first day of each period and a sale at
     the  current  market  price  on the  last  day for  each  period  reported.
     Dividends and distributions are assumed,  for purposes of this calculation,
     to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment
     plan. Total  investment  return does not reflect  brokerage  commissions or
     sales charges.  Total investment  return for a period of less than one year
     is not annualized.
(2)  Calculated  on the basis of income and expenses  applicable  to both common
     and  preferred  shares  relative  to  the  average  net  assets  of  common
     shareholders.
(3)  Inclusive of expenses  offset by custody credits earned on cash balances at
     the custodian bank. (See note 1(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).
(4)  Annualized.
(5)  During the periods indicated above, the Investment Manager waived a portion
     of its  investment  management  fee. If such waiver had not been in effect,
     the ratio of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of net investment
     income to average net assets would have been 1.28%  (annualized)  and 7.74%
     (annualized) respectively for the six months ended November 30, 2004; 1.28%
     and 7.92%, respectively for the year ended May 31, 2004; 1.18% (annualized)
     and  6.76%  (annualized),   respectively  for  the  period  June  28,  2002
     (commencement of operations) through May 31, 2003.

the affairs of the Nominating Committee of the Board, which is posted on the

Committee Charter includes "Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee

nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees. Among other requirements, the
procedures provide that the recommending shareholder must submit any
recommendation in writing to the Registrant to the attention of the Registrant's
Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Registrant

nor more than 75 days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at
which the nominee would be elected. Any recommendation must include certain
biographical and other information regarding the candidate and the recommending
shareholder, and must include a written and signed consent of the candidate to
be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. The foregoing
description of the requirements is only a summary and is qualified in its
