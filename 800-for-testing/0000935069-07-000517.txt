ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The Report to Shareholders is attached herewith.


                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2006

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2006.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Dividend  &  Income  Trust  (the  "Fund")  is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on November 18, 2003 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940,  as amended (the "1940 Act").  Investment  operations  commenced on
November 28, 2003.

     The Fund's investment  objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends and income. The Fund will attempt to
achieve its investment  objective by investing,  under normal market conditions,
at least 80% of its assets in  dividend  paying  securities  (such as common and
preferred stock) or other income producing securities (such as fixed income debt
securities and securities that are convertible into equity securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good  faith to reflect  its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign  market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities  will be fair valued as  determined  by the Board.  Debt  instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board.  Fair  valuation  methodologies  and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial  information  about the company;  comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign  securities to the equivalent U.S.  dollar value American  Depository
Receipt ("ADR") securities at the close of the U.S. exchange;  and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

     In September  2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  157, Fair Value
Measurements,  which  clarifies  the  definition  of  fair  value  and  requires
companies  to expand  their  disclosure  about the use of fair  value to measure
assets and  liabilities  in interim  and annual  periods  subsequent  to initial
recognition.  Adoption of SFAS 157  requires  the use of the price that would be
received  to sell  an  asset  or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an  orderly
transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date. SFAS 157 is
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
November 15, 2007, and interim  periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is in the process of reviewing the  requirements  of SFAS 157 against
its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At December
31, 2006, the Fund had investments of $210,000,000 in repurchase agreements.

                                       11

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     OPTIONS.  The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on  securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Fund  receives  a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial  instrument  underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain,  to the  extent of the  premium,  if the price of the  financial
instrument increases between those dates.

     As a  purchaser  of put  options,  the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines,  the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise.  If the
price of the  underlying  security  increases or stays the same,  the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at  expiration  date,  but only to the extent of the
premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money,"  "at-the-money," and "out-of-the-money,"  respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) covered  at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects
that the  price  of the  underlying  security  will  remain  stable  or  advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money  call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the  appreciation in the price of the underlying  security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the  underlying  security  above
the  exercise  price  of  the  option.   Out-of-the-money,   at-the-money,   and
in-the-money  put options  (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of  the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the  "counterparty")
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the Fund's  variable rate payment  obligation on Series B Preferred
Stock. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty
and, to the extent that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a predetermined
fixed rate,  would  receive from that  counterparty  payments of the  difference
based  on  the  notional  amount  of  such  cap.  Interest  rate  swap  and  cap
transactions  introduce  additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay  preferred  stock  dividends  when due in  accordance  with the  Articles
Supplementary even if the counterparty  defaulted.  If there is a default by the
counterparty  to a swap  contract,  the  Fund  will be  limited  to  contractual
remedies  pursuant to the  agreements  related to the  transaction.  There is no
assurance  that  the swap  contract  counterparties  will be able to meet  their
obligations  pursuant to a swap contract or that,  in the event of default,  the
Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from  obtaining  payments owed to it
pursuant  to  a  swap  contract.  The  creditworthiness  of  the  swap  contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio  securities  at that point in time,  such a default  could  negatively
affect  the Fund's  ability to make  dividend  payments  for Series B  Preferred
Stock. In addition, at the time an interest rate swap or cap transaction reaches
its scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Fund will not be able
to obtain a replacement  transaction or that the terms of the  replacement  will
not be as  favorable as on the expiring  transaction.  If this occurs,  it could
have a negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments on Series
B Preferred Stock.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest  to be paid or received on swaps are  reported as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with  Citibank
N.A.  Under the agreement the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

         NOTIONAL                   VARIABLE RATE*     TERMINATION   UNREALIZED

- ---------------------------------
* Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against  changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and in the
value of  securities  it  intends  to  purchase.  Upon  entering  into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known

                                       12
<PAGE>

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

as the "initial margin."  Subsequent payments  ("variation  margin") are made or
received by the Fund each day,  depending on the daily fluctuations in the value
of the contract, which are included in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on
investments and futures  contracts.  The Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss
when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At December 31, 2006,  there were no
open futures contracts.

     SECURITIES  SOLD  SHORT.  The Fund may enter into short sale  transactions.
Short selling involves  selling  securities that may or may not be owned and, at
times,  borrowing the same  securities  for delivery to the  purchaser,  with an
obligation  to replace such borrowed  securities  at a later date.  The proceeds
received  from short sales are recorded as  liabilities  and the Fund records an
unrealized  gain or loss to the extent of the  difference  between the  proceeds
received  and the value of an open short  position on the day of  determination.
The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short  position is closed out.
By entering into a short sale,  the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable
change in the price of the  security  sold short.  Dividends  on short sales are
recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend  date and interest expense
is recorded on the accrual  basis.  At  December  31,  2006,  there were no open
securities sold short.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At December  31,  2006,  there were no open  forward
foreign exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books  and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase  securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments,  or currency  repatriation,  a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED  AND  ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The  Fund  is  not  subject  to  an
independent  limitation on the amount it may invest in securities  for which the
markets are illiquid.  Illiquid securities include securities the disposition of
which is subject to substantial legal or contractual  restrictions.  The sale of
illiquid  securities  often  requires more time and results in higher  brokerage
charges or dealer  discounts  and other  selling  expenses than does the sale of
securities  eligible  for trading on  national  securities  exchanges  or in the
over-the-counter  markets.  Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than
similar  securities that are not subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities
freely  saleable among  qualified  institutional  investors  under special rules
adopted by the SEC may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity  standards
established by the Board.  The continued  liquidity of such securities is not as
well assured as that of publicly  traded  securities,  and accordingly the Board
will monitor their liquidity.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN  FEE  CREDITS  AND  INTEREST  EXPENSE.  When  cash  balances  are
maintained in the custody  account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits". When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee of 2.00% above the Federal Funds
rate on outstanding  balances.  This amount, if any, would be shown as "interest
expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with Federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications  have no impact on the NAV of the Fund.  For the  fiscal  year
ended December 31, 2006, reclassifications were made to increase accumulated net
investment income by $223,800,  to increase accumulated  distributions in excess
of net  realized  gain on  investments,  swap  contracts,  options,  and foreign
currency  transactions  by $221,108,  with an  offsetting  adjustment to paid-in
capital.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  5.875%  Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C
Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock, 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred
Stock,  and  Series E  Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Cumulative
Preferred  Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described
in Note 5.

     The tax  character  of  distributions  paid  during the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was as follows:

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     At December  31,  2006,  the  difference  between  book basis and tax basis
unrealized  appreciation was primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales
for tax purposes and basis adjustments on investments in partnerships.

     As of December 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

       Net unrealized appreciation on investments, written options,
         foreign currency, and swap contracts ................... $431,173,223
       Post-October currency loss deferral ......................     (449,565)

     In July  2006,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting  for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an  Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("the
Interpretation").  The  Interpretation  establishes for all entities,  including
pass-through  entities  such as the Fund,  a  minimum  threshold  for  financial
statement  recognition  of the benefit of positions  taken in filing tax returns
(including  whether  an entity is  taxable in a  particular  jurisdiction),  and
requires certain expanded tax disclosures.  The Interpretation is required to be
implemented  for the Fund no later than June 29,  2007,  and is to be applied to
all open tax  years as of the date of  effectiveness.  Management  has  recently
begun to evaluate the application of the  Interpretation to the Fund, and is not
in a position at this time to estimate the  significance of its impact,  if any,
on the Fund's financial statements.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's  average
weekly net assets  including the  liquidation  value of the preferred  stock. In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the  management fee on the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

     The Fund's total  return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred Stock for the period.  For the fiscal year ended
December  31,  2006,  the Fund's  total  return on the NAV of the common  shares
exceeded the stated dividend rate or corresponding  swap rate of all outstanding
Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

     During the fiscal year ended  December  31, 2006,  the Fund paid  brokerage
commissions  of $878,825 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli & Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory  Agreement  between the Fund and the Adviser.  During the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund paid or accrued $45,000 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     The Fund is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the  Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the amount of $38,033  for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2006,  which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement
of Operations.

     The Fund pays  each  Trustee  that is not  considered  to be an  affiliated
person an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended
and they are  reimbursed  for any out of pocket  expenses  incurred in attending
meetings.  All Board committee members receive $1,000 per meeting  attended.  In
addition,  the Audit Committee  Chairman  receives an annual fee of $3,000,  the
Proxy  Voting  Committee  Chairman  receives  an annual fee of  $1,500,  and the
Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000. Trustees who are
directors  or  employees  of the  Adviser or an  affiliated  company  receive no
compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  other  than  short-term  and U.S
Government securities, aggregated $984,096,704 and $564,949,256, respectively.

     Option contracts  written by the Fund during the fiscal year ended December
31, 2006 were as follows:

5. CAPITAL. The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares
of  beneficial  interest  (par  value  $0.001).  The  Board has  authorized  the
repurchase  of its shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a
discount of 7.5% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine
from time to time) from the NAV of the  shares.  During  the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2006, the Fund repurchased 340,235 shares of beneficial interest in
the open market at a cost of $6,491,041 and an average discount of approximately
13.99% from its NAV. All shares of  beneficial  interest  repurchased  have been
retired.

     Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

</TABLE>

     The Fund's Declaration of Trust, as amended,  authorizes the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the common  shares and  results in the
financial leveraging of the common shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the  Statements of  Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect  to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Fund  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not  correct  such  failure,  the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the 5.875% Series A, Series B Auction Market, Series
C Auction Market, 6.00% Series D, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock  at  redemption  prices  of  $25,  $25,000,  $25,000,  $25,  and  $25,000,
respectively,  per share  plus an amount  equal to the  accumulated  and  unpaid
dividends  whether  or not  declared  on such  shares  in  order  to meet  these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure  to  meet  the  foregoing  asset  coverage
requirements  could  restrict  the  Fund's  ability to pay  dividends  to common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner  unrelated
to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which  could  have  either a  beneficial  or
detrimental  impact  on net  investment  income  and gains  available  to common
shareholders.

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of  $77,280,971  (after
underwriting discounts of $2,520,000 and offering expenses of $199,029) from the
public  offering of 3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. Commencing October 12, 2009 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time.  During the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2006,
the Fund did not repurchase  any shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  At December 31,  2006,  3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $78,333.

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $217,488,958  (after
underwriting discounts of $2,200,000 and offering expenses of $311,042) from the
public offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  respectively.  The dividend rate, as set by
the auction  process,  which is generally  held every seven days, is expected to
vary with  short-term  interest  rates.  The dividend  rates of Series B Auction
Market Cumulative Preferred Stock ranged from 4.14% to 5.30% for the fiscal year
ended  December  31,  2006.  The  dividend  rates  of  Series C  Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ranged from 4.10% to 5.36%  during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2006. Existing shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid,
or sell  such  shares  on each  auction  date.  Series  B and C  Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred Stock  shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary
market.  The Fund, at its option,  may redeem the Series B and C Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at any
time.  During the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2006,  the Fund did not redeem
any  shares of Series B and C Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At
December 31, 2006,  4,000 and 4,800 shares of the Series B and C Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of
5.30% and 5.32% per share and accrued dividends amounted to $73,611 and $53,200,
respectively.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of  $62,617,239  (after
underwriting discounts of $2,047,500 and offering expenses of $335,261) from the
public  offering of  2,600,000  shares of 6.00%  Series D  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. Commencing November 3, 2010 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time.  During the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2006,
the Fund did not  repurchase  any shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  At December  31,  2006,  2,600,000  shares of 6.00%  Series D Cumulative
Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $65,000.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $133,379,387  (after
underwriting discounts of $1,350,000 and offering expenses of $270,613) from the
public  offering of 5,400 shares of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates.  The dividend
rates of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from 4.22% to
5.30% for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2006.  Existing  shareholders  may
submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each auction date. Series E
Auction Rate Preferred Stock shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary
market.  The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series E Auction Rate Preferred
Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at any time.  During the year
ended  December 31, 2006, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series E Auction
Rate  Preferred  Stock.  At December 31, 2006,  5,400 shares of Series E Auction
Rate Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized  dividend rate of 5.30%
and accrued dividends amounted to $79,500.

     The holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single class. The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right  currently to elect two Trustees and under certain  circumstances
are  entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Trustees.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS.  The Adviser  and/or  affiliates  received  subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund share  trading  practices  involving  certain  funds  managed by the
Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,   Inc.  ("GAMCO"),  the  Adviser's  parent  company,
responded to these  requests for documents and  testimony.  In June 2006,  GAMCO
began discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry.
In February  2007,  the Adviser made an offer of  settlement to the staff of the
SEC for  communication  to the Commission for its  consideration to resolve this
matter.  This offer of settlement is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents.  On a
separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the
SEC that the staff may recommend to the Commission that an administrative remedy
and a monetary penalty be sought from the Adviser in connection with the actions
of two of seven  closed-end  funds  managed by the  Adviser  relating to Section
19(a)  and Rule  19a-1 of the 1940  Act.  These  provisions  require  registered
investment  companies  to provide  written  statements  to  shareholders  when a
dividend is made from a source other than net investment  income.  While the two
closed-end funds sent annual statements and provided other materials  containing
this information, the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with
each  distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser  believes that all of the funds
are now in  compliance.  The Adviser  believes  that these matters would have no
effect on the Fund or any material  adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability
to manage the Fund.  The  staff's  notice to the  Adviser  did not relate to the
Fund.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material respects, the financial position of The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
(hereafter  referred to as the "Fund") at December 31, 2006,  the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial  highlights for each of
the periods  presented,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and
financial highlights  (hereafter referred to as "financial  statements") are the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2006 by  correspondence  with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     The Fund paid to  common,  5.875%  Series A, and 6.00%  Series D  preferred
shareholders ordinary income dividends of $0.84880,  $0.80950,  and $0.82672 per
share, respectively, in 2006. The Fund paid weekly distributions to Series B, C,
and E preferred  shareholders  at varying rates  throughout the year,  including

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST

            APPROVAL OF CONTINUANCE OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

During the six months  ended  December  31,  2006,  the Board of Trustees of the
Trust approved the  continuation of the investment  advisory  agreement with the
Adviser for the Trust on the basis of the  recommendation  by the trustees  (the
"Independent Board Members") who are not "interested  persons" of the Trust. The
following  paragraphs  summarize the material information and factors considered
by the Independent Board Members as well as their  conclusions  relative to such
factors.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Independent Board Members considered
information  regarding  the  portfolio  managers,  the depth of the analyst pool
available   to  the  Adviser   and  the   portfolio   managers,   the  scope  of
administrative,  shareholder  and other  services  supervised or provided by the
Adviser,  and the absence of significant service problems reported to the Board.
The  Independent  Board Members  noted the  experience,  length of service,  and
reputation of the portfolio managers.

INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE.  The Independent Board Members reviewed the performance
of the Fund since inception against a peer group of all closed-end equity funds.
The  Board  Members  noted the  Fund's  excellent  performance  for the one year
period, two year period, and since inception.

PROFITABILITY. The Independent Board Members reviewed summary data regarding the
profitability of the Fund to the Adviser.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Independent  Board Members  discussed the major elements
of the  Adviser's  cost  structure  and the  relationship  of those  elements to
potential  economies of scale and reviewed  rudimentary data suggesting that 20%
growth in the Fund  would not  produce  meaningful  economies  of scale that the
shareholders would not participate in.

SHARING OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The  Independent  Board  Members  noted that the
investment  management  fee schedule for the Fund does not take into account any
potential economies of scale that may develop.

SERVICE AND COST COMPARISONS. The Independent Board Members compared the expense
ratios of the investment  management fee, other expenses,  and total expenses of
the Fund to similar expense ratios of the peer group of closed-end  equity funds
and  noted  that  the  Adviser's  management  fee  includes   substantially  all
administrative services of the Fund as well as investment advisory services. The
Fund's  assets  are  higher  than  all  but six  closed-end  funds.  The  Fund's
management  fee is six basis  points  higher  than the group  average  and total
expense ratio is 36 basis points below the group average.  The Independent Board
Members also noted that the  management  fee  structure  was the same as that in
effect  for most of the  Gabelli  funds.  The  Independent  Board  Members  were
presented  with,  but did not compare,  the  management fee to the fee for other
types of accounts managed by the Adviser.

CONCLUSIONS.  The  Independent  Board  Members  concluded  that the Fund enjoyed
highly experienced portfolio management services, good ancillary services, and a
moderately above average  performance record. The Independent Board Members also
concluded that the Fund's expense ratios and the profitability to the Adviser of
managing  the Fund  were  reasonable,  and that  economies  of scale  were not a
significant factor in their thinking at this time. The Independent Board Members
did not view the potential  profitability  of ancillary  services as material to
their decision.  On the basis of the foregoing and without assigning  particular
weight to any single  conclusion,  the Independent  Board Members  determined to
recommend continuation of the Advisory Agreement to the full Board.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

     It is the policy of The  Gabelli  Dividend  &Income  Trust (the  "Fund") to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to issue shares of common  stock to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of the Fund.  Plan  participants  may
send  their  stock   certificates   to   Computershare   Trust   Company,   N.A.
("Computershare") to be held in their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered
shareholders  wishing to receive  their  distributions  in cash must submit this
request in writing to:

                       The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

     Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

     If your  shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

     The number of shares of common stock  distributed  to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever  the  market  price of the  Fund's  common  stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of common stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Fund's common stock.  The valuation date is
the  dividend or  distribution  payment  date or, if that date is not a New York
Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")  trading  day,  the next trading day. If the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market price of
the common  stock,  participants  will  receive  shares  from the Fund valued at
market  price.   If  the  Fund  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution payable only in cash, Computershare will buy shares of common stock
in the open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts,
except that  Computershare  will  endeavor to  terminate  purchases  in the open
market and cause the Fund to issue shares at net asset value if,  following  the
commencement of such purchases, the market value of the common stock exceeds the
then current net asset value.

     The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends  and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

     The  Voluntary   Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase their  investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

     Participants  in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's common
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

     SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE  must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your request your name,  address,  and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

     For more information regarding the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Fund.

     The Fund  reserves the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

         of the registrant is responsible  for  pre-approving  (i) all audit and
         permissible  non-audit  services  to be  provided  by  the  independent

         directly to the operations and financial  reporting of the  registrant.
         The Committee may delegate its  responsibility  to pre-approve any such
         audit and  permissible  non-audit  services to the  Chairperson  of the
         Committee,  and the  Chairperson  must report to the Committee,  at its

         the time of the  engagement  to be  non-audit  services;  and (ii) such
         services are promptly  brought to the  attention of the  Committee  and

         engagement to audit the registrant's  financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were  attributed  to work  performed by persons

         was 0%.
<PAGE>

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services  rendered to the registrant,  and rendered to the registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant  for  each  of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the
         registrant was $0 for 2005 and $0 for 2006.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset  Management Inc.,  Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities,  Inc., and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. (collectively,
the  "Advisers")  to  determine  how  to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict  between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the  Advisers;  the  principal  underwriter;  or any  affiliated  person  of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the  Advisers do not have  voting  discretion  or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific  guidelines  or  procedures  supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).
<PAGE>

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

The Proxy Voting  Committee was originally  formed in April 1989 for the purpose
of formulating  guidelines and reviewing proxy statements  within the parameters
set by the substantive  proxy voting  guidelines  originally  published by GAMCO
Investors,  Inc. in 1988 and updated periodically,  a copy of which are appended
as  Exhibit  A.  The  Committee  will  include   representatives   of  Research,
Administration,  Legal, and the Advisers.  Additional or replacement  members of
the  Committee  will be  nominated  by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire
Committee.

         Meetings  are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in which
the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         A.    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

               THE ADVISERS HAVE  IMPLEMENTED  THESE PROXY VOTING  PROCEDURES IN
               ORDER TO PREVENT  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  FROM  INFLUENCING  THEIR
               PROXY VOTING  DECISIONS.  BY FOLLOWING THE PROXY  GUIDELINES,  AS
               WELL AS THE  RECOMMENDATIONS  OF ISS, OTHER THIRD-PARTY  SERVICES
               AND THE  ANALYSTS OF GABELLI & COMPANY,  THE ADVISERS ARE ABLE TO
               AVOID, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE INFLUENCE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF
               INTEREST.  NEVERTHELESS,  CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE IN WHICH ONE OR
               MORE OF THE ADVISERS ARE FACED WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR THE
               APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH ITS VOTE.
               IN  GENERAL,  A CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST  MAY ARISE WHEN AN ADVISER
               KNOWINGLY DOES BUSINESS WITH AN ISSUER,  AND MAY APPEAR TO HAVE A
               MATERIAL  CONFLICT BETWEEN ITS OWN INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF
               THE  SHAREHOLDERS OF AN INVESTMENT  COMPANY MANAGED BY ONE OF THE
               ADVISERS  REGARDING HOW THE PROXY IS TO BE VOTED. A CONFLICT ALSO
               MAY EXIST WHEN AN  ADVISER  HAS  ACTUAL  KNOWLEDGE  OF A MATERIAL
               BUSINESS  ARRANGEMENT  BETWEEN AN ISSUER AND AN  AFFILIATE OF THE
               ADVISER.
<PAGE>

               IN  PRACTICAL  TERMS,  A CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST  MAY  ARISE,  FOR
               EXAMPLE,  WHEN A PROXY IS VOTED FOR A COMPANY THAT IS A CLIENT OF
               ONE OF THE  ADVISERS,  SUCH AS  GAMCO  ASSET  MANAGEMENT  INC.  A
               CONFLICT  ALSO MAY ARISE WHEN A CLIENT OF ONE OF THE ADVISERS HAS
               MADE A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL IN A PROXY TO BE VOTED UPON BY ONE OR
               MORE OF THE  ADVISERS.  THE  DIRECTOR OF PROXY  VOTING  SERVICES,
               TOGETHER WITH THE LEGAL  DEPARTMENT,  WILL SCRUTINIZE ALL PROXIES
               FOR THESE OR OTHER SITUATIONS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO A CONFLICT OF
               INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO THE VOTING OF PROXIES.

         A.    OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE.

               For  matters  submitted  to the  Committee,  each  member  of the
               Committee will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the proxy
               statement,  any relevant third party  research,  a summary of any
               views   provided  by  the  Chief   Investment   Officer  and  any
               recommendations by Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  analysts.  The Chief
               Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may be
               invited to present  their  viewpoints.  IF THE  DIRECTOR OF PROXY
               VOTING SERVICES or the Legal  Department  believe that the matter
               before the  committee  is one with respect to which a conflict of
               interest  may exist  between  the  Advisers  and  their  clients,
               counsel will provide an opinion to the Committee  concerning  the
               conflict.  If the  matter  is one in which the  interests  of the
               clients of one or more of Advisers may  diverge,  counsel will so
               advise and the Committee may make different recommendations as to
               different  clients.  For any matters where the recommendation may
               trigger  appraisal  rights,   counsel  will  provide  an  opinion
               concerning  the  likely  risks and  merits  of such an  appraisal
               action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.
<PAGE>

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers' staff may request proxy-voting
records for use in presentations to current or prospective clients. Requests for
proxy voting records should be made at least ten days prior to client meetings.

         If a client  wishes to receive a proxy  voting  record on a  quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual  basis,  please notify the Proxy Voting  Department.  The
reports will be available for mailing  approximately  ten days after the quarter
end of the period.  First  quarter  reports may be delayed  since the end of the
quarter falls during the height of the proxy season.

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1.  Custodian  banks,  outside  brokerage  firms and Wexford  Clearing  Services
Corporation are responsible for forwarding proxies directly to GAMCO.
<PAGE>

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms (VAFs) - Issued by ADP. VAFs must be
     voted through the issuing institution causing a time lag. ADP is an outside
     service contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In  the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions  from the proxy committee (see  Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Since  January 1, 1992,  records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.
The  system  is backed  up  regularly.  From 1990  through  1991,  records  were
maintained  on the PROXY  VOTER  system and in hardcopy  format.  Prior to 1990,
records were maintained on diskette and in hardcopy format.

PROXY EDGE records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue
         The rationale for the vote when it appropriate

Records  prior to the  institution  of the PROXY EDGE system  include:
         Security name
         Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Date of Meeting
         Name of Custodian
         Name of Client
         Custodian Account Number
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' recommendation
         How the Adviser voted for the client on each issue
         Date the proxy statement was received and by whom
         Name of person posting the vote
         Date and method by which the vote was cast
<PAGE>

o    From these records individual client proxy voting records are compiled.  It
     is our policy to provide  institutional  clients with a proxy voting record
     during client reviews. In addition, we will supply a proxy voting record at
     the request of the client on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by ADP are always sent directly
to a specific individual at ADP.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to ADP up until the time of the meeting. This is followed
     up by mailing the original form.

o    When a  solicitor  has been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o    Banks and brokerage firms using the services at ADP:

     The back of the VAF is stamped  indicating  that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent  overnight to ADP. ADP issues  individual  legal proxies
and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay messenger charges).  A
lead-time  of at least  two  weeks  prior to the  meeting  is needed to do this.
Alternatively,  the  procedures  detailed  below  for banks not using ADP may be
implemented.

o    Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

     The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A  limited   Power  of  Attorney   appointing   the   attendee  an  Adviser
     representative.
o    A list of all  shares  being  voted by  custodian  only.  Client  names and
     account numbers are not included.  This list must be presented,  along with
     the  proxies,  to the  Inspectors  of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least
     one-half  hour prior to the scheduled  start of the meeting.  The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e.  determine if the vote have  previously been
     cast,  if the votes have been  rescinded,  etc. vote have  previously  been
     cast, etc.).
o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.
o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.
o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

                                PROXY GUIDELINES







PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES




GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our  clients.  As we  state  in  our  Magna  Carta  of  Shareholders  Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

<PAGE>

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Historical responsiveness to shareholders
          This may include such areas as:
          -Paying  greenmail
          -Failure to adopt shareholder resolutions receiving a majority of
           shareholder votes
o    Qualifications
o    Nominating committee in place
o    Number of outside directors on the board
o    Attendance at meetings
o    Overall performance

SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for audit.

BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.

CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place we will generally not support  attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.
<PAGE>

INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Future use of additional shares
          -Stock split
          -Stock option or other executive compensation plan
          -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet
          -Aid in restructuring
          -Improve credit rating
          -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o    Amount of stock  currently  authorized  but not yet issued or reserved  for
     stock option plans
o    Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.

CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.
<PAGE>

DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.

EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by-case basis.

NOTE:  CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.

ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.

LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.
<PAGE>

CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.

MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.

NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o    State of Incorporation

<PAGE>

o    Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o    Other mitigating factors

POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.

REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o    Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o    Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o    Method of payment
o    Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing stock
     option plans

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.

LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

As reflected  above,  the Portfolio  Managers manage accounts in addition to the
Trust.  Actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest  may arise when a Portfolio
Manager also has day-to-day  management  responsibilities with respect to one or
more other accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION  OF LIMITED TIME AND  ATTENTION.  As indicated  above,  the Portfolio
Managers  manage  multiple  accounts.  As a result,  he/she  will not be able to
devote all of their time to the management of the Trust. The Portfolio Managers,
therefore,  may not be able to  formulate  as  complete a strategy  or  identify
equally attractive investment  opportunities for each of those accounts as might
be the case if he/she were to devote all of their attention to the management of
only the Trust.
<PAGE>

ALLOCATION  OF  LIMITED  INVESTMENT  OPPORTUNITIES.   As  indicated  above,  the
Portfolio  Managers manage managed  accounts with investment  strategies  and/or
policies that are similar to the Trust. In these cases, if the Portfolio Manager
identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple accounts,
a Fund may not be able to take full  advantage of that  opportunity  because the
opportunity  may be  allocated  among  all or many of  these  accounts  or other
accounts managed primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser, and their
affiliates. In addition, in the event a Portfolio Manager determines to purchase
a security for more than one account in an aggregate  amount that may  influence
the market price of the security,  accounts that  purchased or sold the security
first may receive a more  favorable  price than  accounts  that made  subsequent
transactions.

SELECTION  OF  BROKER/DEALERS.  Because  of  Mr.  Gabelli's  position  with  the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor,  he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute  portfolio  transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING STRATEGIES.  At times, the Portfolio Managers may determine
that an investment  opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the accounts
for which he/she exercises investment responsibility, or may decide that certain
of the funds or  accounts  should take  differing  positions  with  respect to a
particular security. In these cases, the Portfolio Manager may execute differing
or opposite  transactions  for one or more accounts  which may affect the market
price of the  security or the  execution  of the  transaction,  or both,  to the
detriment of one or more other accounts.

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION.  A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other benefits  available to the Portfolio Manager differs among the accounts
that he/she  manages.  If the structure of the Adviser's  management  fee or the
Portfolio Manager's  compensation  differs among accounts (such as where certain
accounts pay higher management fees or  performance-based  management fees), the
Portfolio  Manager may be motivated to favor certain  accounts over others.  The
Portfolio  Manager also may be motivated to favor accounts in which they have an
investment  interest,  or  in  which  the  Adviser,  or  their  affiliates  have
investment interests.  Similarly, the desire to maintain assets under management
or to  enhance a  Portfolio  Manager's  performance  record  or to derive  other
rewards,  financial or  otherwise,  could  influence  the  Portfolio  Manager in
affording preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly
benefit the Portfolio Manager. For example, as reflected above, if the Portfolio
Manager  manages  accounts  which have  performance  fee  arrangements,  certain
portions of his/her  compensation  will depend on the achievement of performance
milestones on those accounts.  The Portfolio Manager could be incented to afford
preferential  treatment to those  accounts and thereby be subject to a potential
conflict of interest.

The Adviser,  and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser  and their  staff  members.  However,  there is no  guarantee  that such
policies and  procedures  will be able to detect and prevent every  situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined  by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees the  firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's  compensation)  allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have  arrangements  whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee  attributable  to the  liquidation  value of outstanding  preferred
stock (and Mr.  Gabelli would only receive his  percentage of such advisory fee)
if  certain  performance  levels  are met.  Additionally,  he  receives  similar
incentive  based variable  compensation  for managing other accounts  within the
firm and its  affiliates.  This method of  compensation  is based on the premise
that superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher  compensation  as a result of growth of assets through  appreciation
and net investment  activity.  The level of  compensation is not determined with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  One of the other  registered  investment  companies  managed  by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance  (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his  compensation
is  adjusted  up or down  based on the  performance  of the  investment  company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance  fees.
Compensation  for managing these accounts has two  components.  One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account.  The second component is based on absolute  performance of the account,
with  respect  to  which a  percentage  of such  performance  fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli.  As an executive  officer of the  Adviser's  parent  company,  GBL, Mr.
Gabelli  also  receives ten percent of the net  operating  profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.
<PAGE>

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR BARBARA G. MARCIN

The compensation of Ms. Marcin for the Trust is structured to enable the Adviser
to  attract  and  retain  highly   qualified   professionals  in  a  competitive
environment. The Portfolio Manager receives a compensation package that includes
a minimum draw or base salary, equity-based incentive compensation via awards of
stock options,  and incentive based variable  compensation based on a percentage
of net revenue received by the Adviser for managing the Trust to the extent that
the amount exceeds a minimum level of compensation.  Net revenues are determined
by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees  certain  of the firm's
expenses  (other than the  Portfolio  Managers'  compensation)  allocable to the
Trust (the incentive-based  variable compensation for managing other accounts is
also  based on a  percentage  of net  revenues  to the  investment  adviser  for
managing the account).  This method of compensation is based on the premise that
superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded with
higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation and net
investment  activity.  The level of equity-based  incentive and  incentive-based
variable compensation is based on an evaluation by the Adviser's parent, GBL, of
quantitative and qualitative  performance  evaluation criteria.  This evaluation
takes into account, in a broad sense, the performance of the accounts managed by
the Portfolio  Manager,  but the level of  compensation  is not determined  with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  Generally,  greater  consideration  is given to the  performance  of
larger  accounts  and to longer  term  performance  over  smaller  accounts  and
short-term performance.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND

Mario  Gabelli  and  Barbara  Marcin  owned  over  $1,000,000  and $0 of shares,
respectively, of the Trust as of December 31, 2006.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each  affiliated   registered   investment   company  (each  a
"COMPANY") is committed to conducting  business in  accordance  with  applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate  disclosure -- financial  and otherwise -- in compliance  with
applicable  law.  This  Code  of  Ethics,  applicable  to each  Company's  Chief
Executive Officer,  President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "SENIOR OFFICERS"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer,  you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility  to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have  leadership  responsibilities  that include  creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that  encourages  the  internal  reporting of  compliance  concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics  recognizes  that the Senior  Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies,  because the Senior Officers  currently or may in the future serve as
Senior  Officers  of each of the  Companies,  as officers  or  employees  of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "ADVISOR")
and/or  affiliates  of the  Advisor  (the  "Advisory  Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors  of other  registered  investment  companies and unregistered
investment  funds  advised  by the  Advisory  Group.  This Code of  Ethics  also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and  procedures  adopted by, the  Companies  or the  Advisory  Group govern your
conduct in  connection  with many of the  conflict of interest  situations  that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

         o        the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulation   promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 ACT");

         o        the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "ADVISERS ACT");

         o        the Code of Ethics  adopted by each  Company  pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act  (collectively,  the "TRUST'S 1940
                  ACT CODE OF ETHICS");
<PAGE>

         o        one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been  reviewed and  approved by those  trustees/directors
                  (the  "DIRECTORS")  of each Company  that are not  "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the  "ADVISORY  GROUP'S  1940 ACT
                  CODE OF ETHICS" and,  together  with such  Company's  1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 ACT CODES OF ETHICS");

         o        the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3,   Rule  17a-7  and  Rule  17e-1   under  the  1940  Act
                  (collectively, the "CONFLICT POLICIES"); and

         o        the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other  things,  conflict  of interest  situations  and related
                  matters (collectively, the "ADVISORY POLICIES").

The  provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the  Conflict  Policies  and  the  Advisory  Policies  are  referred  to  herein
collectively as the "ADDITIONAL CONFLICT RULES".

                  This Code of Ethics is  different  from,  and is  intended  to
supplement,  the  Additional  Conflict  Rules.  Accordingly,  a violation of the
Additional  Conflict  Rules by a Senior  Officer  is hereby  deemed  not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional  Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior  Officer has a  responsibility  to each Company to
act with integrity.  Integrity  requires,  among other things,  being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        act with  integrity,  including  being honest and candid while
                  still  maintaining the  confidentiality  of information  where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

         o        comply with the laws,  rules and  regulations  that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's  operations and report any suspected
                  violations  thereof  in  accordance  with  the  section  below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

         o        adhere to a high standard of business ethics.
<PAGE>

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest  for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs  when your  private  interests  interfere  in any way,  or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior  Officers  are expected to use  objective  and unbiased
standards when making  decisions that affect each Company,  keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain  inherent  conflicts of interest  because
Senior  Officers of a Company  also are or may be  officers  of other  Companies
and/or the Advisory  Group (as a result of which it is incumbent  upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner,  including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business  relationships.  When making
any  investment,  accepting  any  position  or  benefits,  participating  in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest  with respect to each Company  where
you are  receiving a personal  benefit,  you should act in  accordance  with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior  Officer  of a Company,  you should  make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and  circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the  Advisory  Group (the  "CCO") and obtain the  approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some  conflict of interest  situations  that should  always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

         o        the receipt of any  entertainment  or non-nominal  gift by the
                  Senior  Officer,  or a member of his or her  family,  from any
                  company  with  which a  Company  has  current  or  prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

         o        a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other  than an  interest  arising  from the  Senior  Officer's
                  employment  by the Advisory  Group,  such as  compensation  or
                  equity ownership.
<PAGE>

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable  disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations  in all reports  and  documents  that such  Company  files with,  or
submits to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or a national  securities
exchange  and in all other  public  communications  made by such  Company.  As a
Senior Officer,  you are required to promote  compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company 's standards,  policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        familiarize   himself   or   herself   with   the   disclosure
                  requirements  applicable  to  each  Company  as  well  as  the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

         o        not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent  auditors,  such Company's counsel,
                  any  counsel  to  the  Independent   Directors,   governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a  violation  of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations,  policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must  report  that  information  on a  timely  basis  to the  CCO or  report  it
anonymously by following the "whistle  blower"  policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

         o        the CCO will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

         o        violations  and potential  violations  will be reported to the
                  Board  of  Directors  of  each  affected  Company  after  such
                  investigation;

         o        if the Board of  Directors  determines  that a  violation  has
                  occurred,  it  will  take  all  appropriate   disciplinary  or
                  preventive action; and

         o        appropriate  disciplinary  or preventive  action may include a
                  letter of censure,  suspension,  dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious  violations of law,  notification of
                  the  Securities and Exchange  Commission or other  appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.
<PAGE>

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

                  Code of Ethics; and

                               ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM


I have received and read the Joint Code of Ethics for Chief Executive and Senior
Financial Officers,  and I understand its contents. I agree to comply fully with
the standards contained in the Code of Ethics and the Company's related policies
and  procedures.  I understand that I have an obligation to report any suspected

         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for

         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)

              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
