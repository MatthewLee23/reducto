1.       ORGANIZATION

         UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
         company  under the laws of  Delaware  on August 13,  2001.  The Fund is
         registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
         "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management  investment
         company.   The  Fund's   investment   objective   is  to  seek  capital
         appreciation over the long term. The Fund is a multi-manager  fund that
         seeks to achieve its  objective by deploying  its assets among a select
         group of portfolio  managers who  primarily  employ  long/short  equity
         strategies,  including those involving foreign issuers. Generally, such
         portfolio   managers   conduct  their   investment   programs   through
         unregistered  investment funds (collectively,  the "Investment Funds"),
         in which the Fund invests as a limited  partner,  member or shareholder
         along with other investors.  The Fund commenced  operations on February
         1, 2003.

         The  Fund's  Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
         responsibility  to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The  Directors  have engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the
         "Adviser"  and,  when  providing   services  under  the  Administration
         Agreement, the "Administrator"),  a Delaware limited liability company,
         to provide  investment  advice  regarding  the  selection of Investment
         Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

         The Adviser is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
         which is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is registered as an
         investment  adviser  under  the  Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be  accepted at such times as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
         generally  accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant
         to written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion.  Members can only transfer or assign
         their membership interests, or portion thereof, (i) by operation of law
         pursuant  to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a
         Member,  or (ii) with the written approval of the Directors,  which may
         be withheld in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Such transfers may
         be made even if the balance of the capital  account to such  transferee
         is equal to or less than the transferor's initial capital contribution.

                                                                               5

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal  period in
         accordance  with the valuation  principles set forth below or as may be
         determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the
         Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to
         the terms and  conditions of the  respective  operating  agreements and
         offering   memoranda,   as  appropriate.   The  Fund's  investments  in
         Investment  Funds are carried at fair  value.  All  valuations  utilize
         financial  information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of
         management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
         Investment  Funds'  managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'
         agreements.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  the Adviser to
         consider all relevant information available at the time the Fund values
         its  portfolio.  The Adviser  and/or the  Directors  will consider such
         information  and consider  whether it is  appropriate,  in light of all
         relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value
         as reported or whether to adjust such value. The underlying investments
         of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in
         each Investment Fund's financial  statements (See Schedule of Portfolio
         Investments).

         Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in
         the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of the
         investment's cost.

         On  September  20,  2006,  the FASB  released  Statement  of  Financial
         Accounting Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS
         157 establishes an authoritative  definition of fair value,  sets out a
         framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures
         about fair-value measurements.  The adoption of FAS 157 is required for
         fiscal years  beginning  after  November  15, 2007 and interim  periods
         within those fiscal years. FAS 157 was adopted as of January 1, 2008 by
         the Fund.

         Various  inputs  are  used  in  determining  the  value  of the  Fund's
         investments  relating to FAS 157.  These inputs are  summarized  in the
         three broad levels listed below.

         LEVEL 1 -- quoted prices in active  markets for  identical  securities.
         LEVEL 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
         for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
         etc.)
         LEVEL 3 -- significant  unobservable   inputs   (including  Fund's  own
         assumptions in determining the fair value of investments.)

         The  inputs  or  methodology  used  for  valuing   securities  are  not
         necessarily  an indication  of the risk  associated  with  investing in
         those securities.

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         The Fund has reclassified  $11,118,080 and $20,534,314 from accumulated
         net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on investments,
         respectively,  to net capital contributions during the six month period
         ended  June  30,  2008.  The  reclassification  was to  reflect,  as an
         adjustment to net contributions, the amount of estimated taxable income
         or loss that have been  allocated to the Fund's  Members as of June 30,
         2008 and had no effect on net assets.

         In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
         FASB  Interpretation  48 ("FIN 48"),  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in
         Income Taxes." This standard  defines the threshold for recognizing the
         benefits  of  tax-return  positions  in  the  financial  statements  as
         "more-likely-than-not"  to be  sustained  by the taxing  authority  and
         requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not
         criterion,  based on the largest  benefit  that is more than 50 percent
         likely to be realized. Management has analyzed the Funds' tax positions
         taken on federal  income tax  returns for all open tax years (tax years
         ended  December 31, 2004 - 2006) and the  positions to be taken for the
         federal  income tax return to be filed for the tax year ended  December
         31, 2007 for purposes of implementing FIN 48, and has concluded that no
         provision   for  income  tax  is  required  in  the  funds'   financial
         statements. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related
         to unrecognized  tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of
         Operations.  During the period,  the fund did not incur any interest or
         penalties.

         Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return
         its distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

         E.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
         accrued  interest,  which is  included in  interest  receivable  on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         F.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
         connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy  that its
         Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities,  the
         fair value of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount of the  repurchase
         transaction,  including accrued  interest,  at all times. If the seller
         defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines, realization of
         the  collateral  by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of June 30,
         2008 there were no outstanding repurchase agreements.

                                                                               8

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         G.  USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Fund's financial statements are
         reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these
         estimates.

3.       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Adviser provides  investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant
         to an Investment  Manager  Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement,  the
         Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee")
         at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets
         attributable to the Adviser and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator
         provides certain administrative services to the Fund, including,  among
         other things, providing office space and other support services.

         In consideration  for such services,  the Fund pays the Administrator a
         monthly fee (the "Administrator Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the
         Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Administrator's
         and  the  Adviser's  capital  account.  The  Administrator  Fee and the
         Investment  Management Fee will be paid to the Administrator out of the
         Fund's  assets and  debited  against  the  Members'  capital  accounts,
         excluding  net  assets  attributable  to the  Administrator's  and  the
         Adviser's capital account.  A portion of the Investment  Management Fee
         and the  Administrator  Fee is paid by  UBSFA  to its  affiliates.  UBS
         Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
         Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without special
         compensation from the Fund, and will bear its own costs associated with
         its activities as placement  agent.  Placement fees, if any, charged on
         contributions are debited against the contribution amounts to arrive at
         a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets
         of the Fund.

         The net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  Members'  capital  derived  from
         operations (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of
         all Members on a pro-rata basis,  other than the Investment  Management
         Fee and the  Administrator  Fee which are  similarly  allocated  to all
         Members other than the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

         Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a
         fee for each meeting  attended.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors
         and the Chairman of the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors each
         receive an  additional  annual  retainer  in the amounts of $10,000 and
         $15,000,  respectively.  These  additional  annual retainer amounts are
         paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata  basis with  eleven  other UBS funds
         where UBS Fund Adviser LLC is the investment adviser. All Directors are
         reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. Total
         amounts  expensed by the Fund related to Directors  for the period from
         January 1, 2008 to June 30,  2008 were  $19,839,  which is  included in
         other expense.

                                                                               9

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

         Other  investment   partnerships  sponsored  by  UBS  Americas  or  its
         affiliates  may also maintain  investment  interests in the  Investment
         Funds owned by the Fund.

4.       ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (an  affiliate  of PNC  Bank,  NA)  serves as the
         custodian (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial
         services for the Fund.

         PNC Global  Investment  Servicing  (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA)
         serves as Accounting  and Investor  Servicing  Agent to the Fund and in
         that  capacity  provides  certain  administrative,  accounting,  record
         keeping,  tax  and  Member  related  services.  PNC  Global  Investment
         Servicing  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the average
         net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii) the
         aggregate  net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
         sponsored  or  advised  by  UBS  Americas,   Inc.  or  its  affiliates.
         Additionally,  the  Fund  reimburses  certain  out of  pocket  expenses
         incurred by PNC Global Investment Servicing.

5.       LOAN PAYABLE

         The  Fund,   along  with  other  UBS  sponsored   funds,   maintains  a
         $200,000,000 committed, unsecured revolving line of credit with Bank of
         Montreal,  a Canadian chartered bank acting through its Chicago branch.
         Under the most restrictive  arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount
         that  combined  with the other  borrowings of the Fund would not exceed
         20%  of its  Total  Eligible  Asset  Value  as  defined  by the  credit
         agreement. The Fund's borrowing capacity is also limited to the portion
         of the  unused  line of credit  at any point in time.  The Fund is only
         liable  under  the line of credit  to the  extent of its own  borrowing
         there under. The interest rate on the borrowing is based on the Federal
         Funds rate plus 150 basis points per annum. The committed facility also
         requires a fee to be paid by the Fund,  on a pro rata  basis,  based on
         the amount of the aggregate  commitment  which has not been utilized of
         25 basis points per annum.  For the period  January 1, 2008 to June 30,
         2008, the Fund's average interest rate paid on borrowings was 4.55% per
         annum and the average  borrowings  outstanding were $662,088.  The Fund
         had no borrowings  outstanding at June 30, 2008.  Interest  expense for
         the period  ended June 30, 2008 was  $15,060.  The Fund had no interest
         payable at June 30, 2008.

         On July 29,  2008,  the Fund,  along  with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
         renewed the $200,000,000 committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
         with Bank of Montreal, for one year with a termination date of July 28,
         2009.  The  provisions  and terms of the  renewed  line of  credit  are
         consistent with the previous year's line of credit agreement except for
         certain new loan covenants.  The new loan covenants  address  portfolio
         diversification limits and maximum portfolio loss levels.

                                                                              10

6.       INVESTMENTS

         As of June 30, 2008, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
         of which were related parties.

         Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of Investment Funds for the
         period  January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2008 amounted to  $296,108,327  and
         $135,539,287, respectively.

         The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
         items of  taxable  income  allocated  to the Fund  from the  Investment
         Funds.  The  allocated  taxable  income is  reported to the Fund by the
         Investment Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for 2008
         will not be finalized by the Fund until after the fiscal year end.

         The agreements  related to investments in Investment  Funds provide for
         compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
         fees of between 1% and 2.5% (per  annum) of net assets and  performance
         incentive fees or allocations  ranging from 16.5% to 25% of net profits
         earned.  One or more  underlying fund  investments  have entered into a
         side pocket arrangement.

7.       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the normal  course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
         Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
         investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but
         are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
         contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
         these Investment Funds is limited to the value of these  investments as
         reported by the Fund.

8.       INDEMNIFICATION

         In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts
         or  agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future
         events  could  occur  that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions
         against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels
         that the likelihood of such an event is remote.

                                                                              11

         (a) Annualized
         (b) Total  return  assumes a purchase of an interest in the Fund at the
             beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on the last
             day of the  period  noted and does not  reflect  the  deduction  of
             placement  fees,  if any,  incurred when  subscribing  to the Fund.
             Total  returns  for a  period  of  less  than a full  year  are not
             annualized.  An individual member's ratios and return may vary from
             the above based on the timing of capital transactions.
         (c) The  average  net assets  used in the above  ratios are  calculated
             using pre-tender net assets.
         (d) Ratio of total  expenses to average net assets does not include the
             impact of expenses for  incentive  allocations  or  incentive  fees
             related to the underlying Investment Funds.
