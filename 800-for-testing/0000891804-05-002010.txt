  Chairman of the Board

      Chairman's
            Letter to Shareholders

      Once again, I am pleased to report that over the six-month period covered
      by this semiannual report your Fund continued to provide you with monthly
      tax-free income and an attractive total return. For more details about the
      management strategy and performance of your Fund, please see the Portfolio
      Manager's Comments and Performance Overview sections of this report.

      As I noted in my last letter to you, our conversations with financial
      advisers and investors suggest that many of you may be wondering whether
      longer-term interest rates will soon begin to rise substantially,
      mirroring the rise that has taken place over the past year in shorter-term
      rates. If longer-term rates do begin to rise significantly, some of you
      also may be wondering if that makes this a good time to adjust your
      holdings of fixed-income investments. We can't answer these questions for
      you - no one knows what the future will bring.

"In fact, a well-diversified portfolio may actually help to reduce your overall
investment risk."

      From our experience, we do know that a well-balanced portfolio, structured
      and carefully monitored with the help of a trusted investment
      professional, can be an important component in helping you achieve your
      long-term financial goals. In fact, a well-diversified portfolio may
      actually help to reduce your overall investment risk. That is one reason
      why we believe that a municipal bond investment like your Nuveen Fund can
      be an important building block in a comprehensive investment program
      designed to perform well in a variety of market conditions.

      As in past reports, I urge you to consider receiving future Fund reports
      and other Fund information by e-mail and the Internet. Not only will you
      be able to receive the information faster, but this also may help lower
      your Fund's expenses. Sign up is quick and easy - see the inside front
      cover of this report for instructions.

      Some of you may have heard that in April, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers
      Companies, Inc., which owned 79% of Nuveen Investments, Inc. (the parent
      of your Fund's investment adviser) completed a public offering of a
      substantial portion of its equity stake in Nuveen. At the same time, St.
      Paul Travelers also entered into agreements to sell the balance of its
      shares in Nuveen to us or to others at a future date.

      These transactions will have no impact on the investment objectives or
      management of your Fund. However, taken as a whole they are considered to
      be an "assignment" of your Fund's investment management agreement. This
      means that you and your fellow Fund shareholders soon will be asked to
      formally approve the continuation of your Fund's management contract with
      Nuveen. We will be sending you more information about this process in the
      coming weeks.

      At Nuveen Investments, our mission continues to be to assist you and your
      financial advisor by offering investment services and products that can
      help you to secure your financial objectives. We are grateful that you
      have chosen us as a partner as you pursue your financial goals, and we
      look forward to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years
      ahead.

      Sincerely,


      /s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Nuveen Investments National Insured Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds
NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG, NEA

Portfolio Manager's
         Comments

Portfolio manager Dan Solender reviews key investment strategies and the
semiannual performance of these six insured Funds. With thirteen years of
investment experience, including nine at Nuveen, Dan has managed NQI, NIO, NIF,
NPX, NVG and NEA since May 2004.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
APRIL 30, 2005?

Between November 2004 and April 2005, the Federal Reserve introduced four
quarter-point increases in the fed funds rate, raising this short-term rate
benchmark from 1.75% to 2.75%. (On May 3, 2005, following the end of this
reporting period, the Fed announced another 0.25% hike, bringing the fed funds
rate to 3.00%.) Given these short-term rate increases, many market participants
expected to see steadily higher interest rates across most of the municipal
market yield curve as we moved through the reporting period. This did not occur,
as longer-term yields (as measured by the widely-followed Bond Buyer 25 Revenue
Municipal Bond Index) declined by 14 basis points during the six-month period.
As a result, the municipal yield curve flattened.

In this environment, our focus for all these Funds remained on a strategy we
have employed for the past few years -- finding and holding bonds that, in our
judgment, would add immediate value to the Funds' portfolios and that could also
perform well under a variety of future market scenarios.

As a result, our purchase activity during this period generally concentrated on
bonds in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve (bonds that mature in
about 20 years) as part of our efforts to improve the maturity positioning of
these insured Funds. We worked to accomplish this by reducing some of the Funds'
holdings of bonds with effective maturities of less than 10 years, including
bonds pre-refunded to short call dates and longer-term bonds with call dates
coming within the next few years, and replacing these with securities that
mature in 20 years or more. Because we only want to buy attractively priced
bonds, this is an ongoing effort that will take more time to complete. This
reallocation also helped us to diversify the call exposure of NQI, NIO, NIF and
NPX as we sold bonds with shorter call dates and reinvested the proceeds at
systematic intervals along the longer part of the yield curve.

In looking for new additions to our portfolios, we sought bonds with premium
prices -- that is, bonds trading above their par value because they have coupons
greater than current coupon levels. Historically, these bonds have tended to
hold their value better than current coupon bonds when interest rates rise. When
possible, we purchased bonds issued within states like New York, California,
Michigan and Florida where investors typically show strong, consistent demand
for municipal bonds. We believe this historically strong demand, regardless of
the economic or interest rate environment, may provide more price support over
time for the bonds in the Funds' portfolios, and also provide for enhanced
liquidity if opportunities arise to sell the securities at attractive prices.

Our efforts were helped by the strong supply of municipal bonds during this
reporting period. For the six months ended April 2005, municipal issuance
nationwide totaled $187.7 billion, up 8.6% from the six months ended April 2004.
One of the major drivers of the increased supply during this current period was
a significant growth in the number of refundings, as issuers sought to take
advantage of relatively low current interest rates.

As discussed in the last shareholder report, in late 2004 we began using forward
interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, to hedge some
the interest rate risk of NVG and NEA. It is important to note that we did not
use the hedges in an attempt to profit from correctly predicting the timing and
direction of interest rates movements. Instead, our sole objective was to reduce
the Funds' durations (and therefore their price sensitivity to interest rate
changes) without having a negative impact on their income streams or common
share dividends over the short term. The gain or loss from the hedges is
reflected as an addition or subtraction to each Fund's net asset value (NAV) as
the market value of the hedges fluctuate. The hedges achieved their objective of
reducing the volatility of both Funds' NAVs while maintaining the Funds' income
over the course of this reporting period. These hedges had a negative impact on
the Funds' total returns over the six month period because declining long-term
interest rates caused the values of the hedges to decline as the value of the
Fund's portfolios rose.


                                                                               5

*     Six-month returns are cumulative; returns for one year, five years, and
      ten years are annualized.

Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance may be
higher or lower than the data shown. Returns do not reflect the deduction of
taxes that shareholders may have to pay on Fund distributions or upon the sale
of Fund shares.

For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for your
Fund in this report.

For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the cumulative returns on NAV for all
six of the Funds covered in this report outperformed the return on the Lehman
Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index. NVG and NEA also outperformed the average
return for their Lipper insured peer group, while NQI and NIO performed roughly
in line with this measure and NIF and NPX trailed the peer group average.

One of the primary factors benefiting the six-month performance of these Funds
relative to that of the unleveraged, unmanaged Lehman Brothers insured index was
the Funds' use of financial leverage. While leveraging can add volatility to the
Funds' NAVs and share prices, especially during periods of rising interest
rates, this strategy can also provide opportunities for additional income and
total returns for common shareholders when short-term interest rates remain
relatively low and long-term rates fall or remain fairly constant, as they did
during this reporting period.

(1)   The Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged,
      unmanaged national index comprising a broad range of insured municipal
      bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

(2)   The Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds category average is calculated
      using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in this category
      for each period as follows: 6 months, 27 funds; 1 year, 27 funds; 5 years,
      21 funds; and 10 years, 18 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume
      reinvestment of dividends.

As a result of this yield curve flattening discussed earlier, the prices of
bonds with longer maturities generally tended to perform better than those of
securities with shorter maturities. This contributed to the performance of Funds
such as NVG and NEA, which had relatively more exposure to the long end of the
yield curve when compared with NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX. As of April 30, 2005, NEA
held no bonds with maturities less than five years and had a healthy weighting
in bonds that mature in 20 years or longer. Similarly, NVG had less exposure to
bonds with effective maturities of less than 10 years than did NQI, NIO, NIF or
NPX. The relative holdings of longer and shorter effective maturities among
these Funds accounted for much of their performance differential with each other
over the six-month reporting period.

The flattening of the yield curve over this period also reflected an environment
in which many issuers found refundings more economically feasible. This led to
an increase in escrowed and pre-refunded holdings, especially in NEA, NVG and
NPX. The performance of these Funds was boosted by the price appreciation
accompanying these advance refundings. At the same time, however, we were
trimming some of the Funds' holdings of older pre-refunded bonds, which tended
to underperform the general municipal market during this period due primarily to
the shorter effective maturities of these securities.

NVG and NEA, which can invest up to 20% of their assets in uninsured
investment-grade quality securities, also generally benefited from their
allocations to these lower-rated bonds during this period. As of April 30, 2005,
NVG held 8% of its portfolio in uninsured bonds rated AAA, and AA, while NEA
allocated 11% to uninsured investment-grade rated securities.

During this six-month period, zero coupon bonds as a group outperformed the
general municipal market, and the performances of NIO and NQI were helped by
their holdings in this category.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
APRIL 30, 2005?

We continued to believe that, given the current geopolitical and economic
climate, maintaining strong credit quality was an important requirement. As of
April 30, 2005, NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX continued to be 100% invested in insured
and/or U.S. guaranteed securities, while NVG and NEA, which can invest up to 20%
of their assets in uninsured investment-grade quality securities, had allocated
92% and 89% of their portfolios, respectively, to AAA rated insured and U.S.
guaranteed securities.

As of April 30, 2005, potential call exposure for the period May 2005 through
the end of 2006 ranged from 0% in NVG to 1% in NEA, 5% in NIF, 11% in NPX, 12%
in NIO and 15% in NQI. The number of actual bond calls in all of these Funds
depends largely on future market interest rates.


                                                                               7

Dividend and Share Price
Information

All six of the Funds in this report use leverage to enhance opportunities for
additional income for common shareholders. The extent of this benefit is tied in
part to the short-term rates the Funds pay their MuniPreferred, shareholders.
During periods of low short-term rates, leveraged Funds generally pay lower
dividends to MuniPreferred shareholders, which can leave more earnings to
support common share dividends. However, when short-term interest rates rise, as
they did during this reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise.
While leveraging can still provide benefits for common shareholders as
short-term rates rise, the extent of the benefit may be less. In addition, any
reinvested proceeds from bonds called or retired during this period were
reinvested in a low interest rate environment, which also tended to reduce the
income generated by the Funds. The combination of these two factors led to
dividend reductions in NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX and NVG over the six-month period
ended April 30, 2005. NEA, which was initially invested during the relatively
low rate environment of late 2002, had limited opportunities to build its income
stream because of the continued low interest rates that has prevailed since its
introduction. As a result, this Fund experienced two dividend reductions during
this reporting period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of the following Funds received capital gains and/or net ordinary income
distributions at the end of December 2004 as follows:

                                  Long-Term Capital Gains        Ordinary Income

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's net asset value (NAV). Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively
paid dividends in excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII
that is likewise reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all
of its net investment income as dividends to shareholders.

(1)   Taxable equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. For
      investments that generate qualified dividend income, the taxable
      equivalent yield is lower.

(2)   The Fund also paid shareholders a capital gains distribution in December
      2004 of $0.0325 per share.

(1)   Taxable equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. For
      investments that generate qualified dividend income, the taxable
      equivalent yield is lower.

                  Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or
                  Portfolio Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust
                  containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government
                  agency securities, any of which ensure the timely payment of
                  principal and interest.

            (1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                  based on net assets applicable to Common shares unless
                  otherwise noted.

              *   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of
                  the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other
                  call provisions at varying prices at later dates.

             **   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
                  rating.

            (a)   The issuer has received a preliminary adverse determination
                  from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon payments as tax-exempt income until
                  such time that it is formally determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier
Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities.

Effective January 1, 2005, Nuveen Advisory Corp. ("NAC"), the Funds' previous
Adviser, and its affiliate, Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp. ("NIAC"), were
merged into Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM"), each wholly owned subsidiaries of
Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"). As a result of the merger, NAM is now the
Adviser to all funds previously advised by either NAC or NIAC.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. Prices of
derivative investments are also provided by an independent pricing service
approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the pricing service is
unable to supply a price for a derivative investment each Fund may use a market
quote provided by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined
that market prices for an investment are unavailable or inappropriate, the Board
of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a fair value
for the investment. Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased on a when-issued and/or delayed delivery basis may
have extended settlement periods. Any securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2005,
Insured Opportunity (NIO) and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) had outstanding
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments of $26,095,369 and
$8,421,348, respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in
any of the other Funds.


                                                                              65

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, and in
the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax
applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to
shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income
distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate on each Series is
determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the
auction agent, and is payable weekly at the end of each rate period. The number
of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund is as
follows:

Insurance

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets applicable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets applicable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) municipal bonds that are rated, at the time of investment,
within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch)
or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Forward Swap Transactions

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments. The Funds' use
of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to mitigate the negative
impact that an increase in long-term interest rates could have on Common share
net asset value. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve each Fund's
agreement with the counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed rate payment in
exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable rate payment. The
amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward
swap contract. The Funds may close out a contract prior to the effective date at
which point a realized gain or loss would be recognized. When a forward swap is
terminated, it does not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying
assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash. Each Fund intends, but is
not obligated to, terminate its forward swaps before the effective date.
Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such
transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with a counterparty
failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon
termination. To minimize such credit risk, all counterparties are required to
pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of
each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain
above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an
unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have instructed the custodian to
pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to the
amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral
pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations
fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.


                                                                              67

Notes to
      Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, its Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out the performance of their
duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Funds
enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other parties. The
Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to the treatment of paydown gains and losses on investments,
timing differences in recognizing income on taxable market discount securities
and timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on security
transactions.

Notes to
      Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

At October 31, 2004, the Funds' last fiscal year end, Insured Premium Income 2
(NPX) had an unused capital loss carryforward of $12,018,781 available for
federal income tax purposes to be applied against future capital gains, if any.
If not applied, the carryforward will expire in 2008.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

As approved by the Board of Directors/Trustees, effective August 1, 2004, a
complex-wide management fee structure was adopted for all funds sponsored by the
Adviser, or its predecessor and its affiliates. This fee structure separates
each fund's management fee into two components - a complex-level component,
based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the Adviser and a
specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets within each
individual fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund shareholders to
benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as well as from
growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser. Under no
circumstances will this pricing structure result in a fund paying management
fees at a rate higher than would otherwise have been applicable had the
complex-wide management fee structure not been implemented. As of May 31, 2005,
the complex-level fee rate was .1905%; that is, the funds' effective management
fees were reduced by approximately .0095%.

Effective August 1, 2004, the annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each
of the Funds is based upon the average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to Preferred shares) of each Fund as follows:

Effective August 1, 2004, the annual complex-level fee, payable monthly, which
is additive to the fund-level fee, for all Nuveen sponsored funds in the U.S.,
is based on the aggregate amount of total fund assets managed as follows:

================================================================================

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
      the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
      all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
      in the U.S.

(2)   With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
      rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
      date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
      billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
      be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
      fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
      time as a different rate or rates is determined.

Each Fund paid through July 31, 2004, an annual management fee, payable monthly,
at the rates set forth below, which were based upon the average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to Preferred shares) of each Fund as follows:

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to their officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised Funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
Funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

6. Announcement Regarding Parent Company of Adviser

In early April, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul
Travelers"), which owned 79% of Nuveen, (A) completed a public offering of a
substantial portion of its equity stake in Nuveen, (B) sold Nuveen $200 million
of its Nuveen shares, (C) entered into an agreement with Nuveen to sell an
additional $400 million of its Nuveen shares on a "forward" basis with payment
for and settlement of these shares delayed for several months, and (D) entered
into agreements with two unaffiliated investment banking firms to sell an amount
equal to most or all of its remaining Nuveen shares for current payment but for
future settlement. The settlement of transactions (C) and (D) above would likely
be deemed an "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the investment
management agreements between the Funds and the Adviser, which would result in
the automatic termination of each agreement under the 1940 Act. The Board of
Directors/Trustees will consider approval of new ongoing investment management
agreements for each Fund and the submission of those agreements for approval by
each respective Fund's shareholders. Those agreements, if approved by a Fund's
shareholders, would take effect upon such approval. There can be no assurance
that these approvals will be obtained.

7. Subsequent Event - Distributions to Common Shareholders

The Funds declared Common share dividend distributions from their tax-exempt net
investment income which were paid on June 1, 2005, to shareholders of record on
May 15, 2005, as follows:

*     Annualized.

**    Total Investment Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in
      the market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income
      and reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price
      paid per share at the time of reinvestment. Total Return on Common Share
      Net Asset Value is the combination of changes in Common share net asset
      value, reinvested dividend income at net asset value and reinvested
      capital gains distributions at net asset value, if any. Total returns are
      not annualized.

***   After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

Reinvest Automatically
      Easily and Conveniently

Nuveen makes reinvesting easy. A phone call is all it takes to set up your
reinvestment account.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over
which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a
measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when
market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration,
the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.
Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund
and therefore is longer than the duration of the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.
