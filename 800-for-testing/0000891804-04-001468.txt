Sidebar text: WE THINK THAT MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS LIKE YOUR NUVEEN FUND CAN
BE IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCKS IN A WELL-BALANCED PORTFOLIO.

Dear
   SHAREHOLDER

I am very pleased to report that for the period ended April 30, 2004, your
Nuveen Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free income.

While tax-free income is always welcome, we know that many shareholders are
beginning to wonder whether interest rates will rise significantly, and whether
that possibility should cause them to adjust that portion of their investment
portfolios allocated to tax-free municipal bonds. We believe this is a question
you should consider carefully with the help of a trusted financial advisor. In
many cases, it may be more appropriate to focus on long-term goals and
objectives rather than shorter-term market movements, and this is where a
professional advisor may be able to help keep you focused on the larger
objectives of your investment program.

As you read through this report, please review the inside front cover and
consider receiving future Fund reports and other Fund information by e-mail and
the Internet. Not only will you be able to receive the information faster, but
this also may help lower your Fund's expenses. Sign up is quick and easy.

Since 1898, Nuveen Investments has offered financial products and solutions that
incorporate careful research, diversification and the application of
conservative risk-management principles. We are grateful that you have chosen us
as a partner as you pursue your financial goals. We look forward to continuing
to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,


/s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Nuveen National Insured Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds
(NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG, NEA)

Portfolio Manager's
                COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom O'Shaughnessy reviews the market environment, key
investment strategies, and the six-month performance of the Funds. With 21 years
of investment experience at Nuveen, Tom assumed portfolio management
responsibility for NEA at its inception in 2002, adding NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, and
NVG in 2003. After the end of this six-month reporting period, management
responsibility for these Funds switched to Dan Solender. Dan has eleven years of
investment experience, including seven at Nuveen. The investment objectives of
the Funds have not changed.)


WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE SIX-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2004?

During this reporting period, the greatest influences on the national economy
and the municipal market continued to be historically low interest rates,
growing evidence of economic improvement, and a generally modest rate of
inflation. Since its last credit easing in June 2003, the Federal Reserve has
maintained the fed funds rate at 1.0%, the lowest level since 1958. This
accommodative monetary policy helped to spur GDP (gross domestic product) growth
of 4.4% annualized in the first quarter of 2004, following a 3.1% rise in 2003.
Over the six-month reporting period, the year-over-year rate of inflation, as
measured by the core Consumer Price Index, averaged 1.3%.

This generally favorable environment helped many municipal bonds perform well
during most of the six-month period ended April 30, 2004. However, in early
April, a sharply improved jobs report, along with subsequent indications of
growing momentum in the U.S. economy, served as catalysts for increased
expectations of a Fed rate hike. This all contributed to heightened volatility
in the fixed-income markets. During April, the yield on the Bond Buyer 20 index,
a widely followed measure of general obligation bonds, rose more than 50 basis
points. This rise in the index yield, and the corresponding decline in bond
prices, effectively offset the yield declines and price gains of the previous
five months. As of April 30, 2004, the Bond Buyer 20 index was at approximately
the same level as it was at the beginning of the six-month reporting period.

In general, municipal supply remained strong over the past six months, although
the pace of issuance slowed. The first four months of 2004 saw $110 billion in
new municipal supply, down 9% from January-April 2003. Over the entire six-month
reporting period ended April 2004, the supply of new bonds decreased 13%
compared with the preceding six months.

IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THE FUNDS DURING
THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2004?

With the market continuing to anticipate an increase in interest rates, our
major focus during this reporting period remained on careful management of the
Funds' durations1 as a way to mitigate some of the interest rate risk inherent
in each Fund's portfolio. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a
Fund's portfolio will decline if market interest rates rise (since bond prices
move in the opposite direction of interest rates). The longer the duration of a
Fund's portfolio, the greater the


1 Duration is a measure of a Fund's net asset value (NAV) volatility in reaction
  to interest rate movements. Fund duration, also known as leverage-adjusted
  duration, takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund and therefore
  is generally longer than the duration of the actual portfolio of individual
  bonds that make up the Fund. References to duration in this commentary are
  intended to indicate Fund duration unless otherwise noted.


                                       2

<PAGE>

Fund's interest rate risk. Our use of such a duration management strategy is
designed to help position the Funds to potentially produce more consistent
returns over time as interest rates inevitably rise and fall.

The one exception to this strategy was NEA, the newest of these six Funds. With
NEA, we made a deliberate decision to keep the duration longer than the other
Funds in order to enhance this Fund's initial income stream.

As mentioned earlier, the supply of new municipal bonds softened nationwide
during the six-month reporting period. This tighter supply had a modest impact
on our ability to enhance the diversification of the two newer Funds, NVG and
NEA, since it occasionally took longer to find securities that we believed had
the potential to add value and that carried the types of structures and features
we preferred. In addition, with yields remaining low over most of this period,
the market did not offer a great number of opportunities to improve the Funds'
income streams. In general, turnover in these Funds was comparatively low for
the six months ended April 30, 2004.

In keeping with our duration management strategy and the steepness of the
municipal bond yield curve over this reporting period, the bonds we did purchase
tended to be in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve (i.e., bonds that
mature in 16 to 20 years). In many cases, bonds in this part of the curve
offered yields similar to those of longer-term bonds with less inherent interest
rate risk and better total return potential. Overall, we looked for bonds that
would help us keep the Funds' portfolios diversified in terms of industry
sector, maturity and geographic region.

Another ongoing strategy focused on the gradual reduction of the Funds' exposure
to bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). In accomplishing this, we
looked to use tax loss carryforwards whenever possible to offset gains realized
when we sold bonds that had appreciated in value.

<PAGE>

For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the cumulative returns of NVG and NEA
outperformed the returns of both the Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond
Index and the Funds' Lipper peer group average. The returns of NQI and NIF were
in line with these measures, while the returns of NIO and NPX trailed both the
Lehman and Lipper returns.

In general, insured and higher-rated bonds did not perform as well as BBB rated
bonds during this six-month period, and this is reflected in the returns of all
these Funds, as well as the Lehman Index and Lipper peer group. Both NVG and NEA
performed the best during this period, in large part because they are allowed to
invest in uninsured, lower-rated investment-grade securities. NEA also benefited
from its holdings of uninsured healthcare bonds. Healthcare, which ranked second
in terms of returns among the Lehman municipal revenue sectors during this
period, continued to perform well due to improvements in cost containment and
reimbursement practices.

Looking at the fully insured Funds, NIO and NPX underperformed NQI and NIF for
several reasons. First, NIO and NPX had relatively more housing bond calls than
the other two Funds, and thus had more funds to invest at current low rates.
These Funds also had higher levels of pre-refunded bonds than NQI or NIF and
pre-refunded bonds tended to underperform relative to other bonds over this
period. Another factor that constrained the performances of NIO and NPX during
this period included their relatively large exposure to AMT bonds. In recent
months, these bonds did not perform as well as their non-AMT counterparts.

HOW ABOUT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates remaining at historically low levels during this
reporting period, the leveraged structures of these Funds continued to support
their dividend-paying capabilities. The extent of this benefit is tied in part
to the short-term rates the Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders.
During periods of low short-term rates, the Funds generally pay relatively lower
dividends to their MuniPreferred shareholders, which can leave more earnings to
support common share dividends. During this reporting period, continued low
short-term rates enabled us to maintain the dividend levels of all six insured
Funds.

All of these Funds seek to pay stable dividends at rates that reflect each
Fund's past results and projected future performance. During certain periods,
each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less than the amount
of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the period. If a
Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it holds the
excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as part of the
Fund's net asset value (NAV). Conversely, if a Fund has


2 The Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged
  national index comprising a broad range of insured municipal bonds. Results
  for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

3 The Lipper Insured (Leveraged) Municipal Debt Funds category average is
  calculated using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in this
  category for each period as follows: 6 months - 27 funds; 1 year - 26 funds; 5
  years - 20 funds and 10 years - 18 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume
  reinvestment of dividends.


                                       4

<PAGE>

cumulatively paid dividends in excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes
negative UNII that is likewise reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over
time, pay all of its net investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of
April 30, 2004, all of the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances
except NEA, which had a negative UNII balance mainly because it is a newer Fund
that has not been around long enough to accumulate its income.

As of April 30, 2004, NIO was trading at a -4.04% discount to its NAV, compared
with an average premium of 34.7% for the six-month period. NIO was trading at a
- -8.45% discount, compared with an average discount of -1.09%. NIF was at a
discount of -7.36%, compared with an average premium for the period of 0.12%.
NPX was at a -8.61% discount, compared to an average premium of 0.29%. NVG was
at a discount at -9.44%, compared to an average discount of -4.17%. NEA was
trading at a discount of -5.92%, compared with an average premium of 0.45% for
the reporting period.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
APRIL 30, 2004?

Given the current geopolitical and economic climate, we continued to believe
that maintaining strong overall credit quality was an important requirement.
NQI, NIO, NIF and NPX continued to be 100% invested in insured and/or U.S.
guaranteed securities. As noted, NVG and NEA are allowed to invest up to 20% of
their assets in uninsured investment-grade quality securities. As of April 30,
2004, NVG had 91% of its portfolio in insured bonds, while NEA had 88%.

As of April 30, 2004, potential call exposure for these Funds during 2004-2005
ranged from zero in NVG and 1% in NEA to 7% in NIF, 11% in NPX, 14% in NIO, and
20% in NQI. The number of actual bond calls in all of these Funds will depend
largely on market rates and the needs of the securities' issuers.

We continue to manage these insured Funds as long-term investments focused on
providing dependable tax-free income and preserving net asset value through the
prudent management of credit and interest rate risk.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The National Funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding
Common share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund,
Inc. (NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen
Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Prior to the commencement of operations of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA), the
Fund had no operations other than those related to organizational matters, the
initial capital contribution of $100,275 by Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the
"Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. and the
recording of the organization expenses ($11,500) and their reimbursement by
Nuveen Investments, LLC, also a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments,
Inc.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. If it is
determined that market prices for a security are unavailable or inappropriate,
the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a
fair value for the security. Temporary investments in securities that have
variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2004,
Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) had outstanding when-issued purchase commitments of $1,108,380,
$1,419,337, and $8,423,947, respectively. There were no such outstanding
purchase commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed
to shareholders of the Funds.


                                       54

<PAGE>

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

</TABLE>

Effective January 17, 2003, Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) issued 2,880 Series
T and 2,880 Series W, $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.

Insurance

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets applicable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets applicable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) municipal bonds that are rated, at the time of investment,
within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch)
or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

                Notes to
                    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)



Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance is effective only while the municipal securities are held by the
Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the market value of
the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net asset value of the
Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio Insurance. Each
policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds the right to
obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security covered by the
Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the six months ended April 30, 2004.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Offering Costs

Nuveen Investments, LLC has agreed to pay all Common share offering costs (other
than the sales load) that exceed $.03 per Common share for Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA). Insured Tax-Free Advantage's (NEA) share of Common share
offering costs ($440,201) was recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the
sale of Common shares.

Costs incurred by Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) in connection with the
offering of Preferred shares ($3,084,842) were recorded as a reduction to
paid-in surplus.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, its Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing income on taxable market
discount securities and timing differences in recognizing certain gains and

Under Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage's (NEA)
investment management agreements with the Adviser, each Fund pays an annual
management fee, payable monthly, at the rates set forth below, which are based
upon the average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to their officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates.

As approved by the Board of Directors/Trustees, a complex-wide fee schedule for
all Funds managed by the Advisor and its affiliates will go into effect on
August 1, 2004. This complex-wide fee schedule is expected to marginally
decrease the rate at which management fees are to be paid by the Funds. Under no
circumstances will the complex-wide fee schedule result in an increase in the
rate at which management fees would be paid by the Funds if the complex-wide fee
schedule were not implemented.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

Certain investments owned by the Funds are either covered by insurance issued by
several private insurers or are backed by an escrow or trust containing U.S.
Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both of which ensure the timely
payment of principal and interest in the event of default (100% for Insured
Quality (NQI), 100% for Insured Opportunity (NIO), 100% for Premier Insured
Income (NIF), 100% for Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX), 91% for Insured Dividend
Advantage (NVG) and 88% for Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA)). Such insurance or
escrow, however, does not guarantee the market value of the municipal securities
or the value of any of the Funds' shares.

For additional information regarding each investment security, refer to the
Portfolio of Investments of each Fund.

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.


NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A description of the policies and procedures that the Funds use to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (i) without
charge, upon request, by calling Nuveen Investments at (800) 257-8787; and (ii)
on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

POLICY CHANGE

On February 25, 2004, the Board approved policies that would allow NVG and NEA
at the discretion of the Adviser, to engage in certain types of derivative
transactions for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk. There is no
guarantee that the Adviser will cause a Fund to enter into such transactions. If
a Fund were to engage in hedging, there is no guarantee that such hedging will
be successful.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ----------
*Director/Trustee will be retiring on June 30, 2004.

Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock in
the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed advisable. No shares
were purchased during the six-months ended April 30, 2004. Any future
repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual or semiannual
report.
