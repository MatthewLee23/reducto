President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Today's market environment presents numerous opportunities as well as challenges
for investors. A disparate global economic landscape has formed, with the U.S.
facing prospects for continued growth, while questions abound regarding the
outlook for other regions. Employment, household income, and corporate profits
have been rising in the U.S. and inflation pressures remain low.  However, many
countries across Europe as well as Japan face muted growth. In addition, a
variety of factors have clouded the outlook for countries such as Russia and
Brazil and China's investment-driven economy continues to slow.

Monetary policies of major central banks are diverging, reflecting different
economic conditions. With the U.S. economy no longer in need of extraordinary
stimulus, the Federal Reserve Board may be closer to raising short-term interest
rates. Conversely, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are likely to
be adding, not removing, stimulus.

While we anticipate continued growth for the U.S., the outlook is far from
certain, nor is the outlook for other regions necessarily dire. It remains to
be seen how weakness outside the U.S. will affect global growth and whether
easing monetary policies in other regions will spur an economic recovery.

While these economic conditions may lead to increasing volatility in 2015, we
believe the opportunity for investors to earn attractive returns will persist.
However, in an environment where interest rates remain low and equity valuations
have been buoyed by an extended bull market, we believe it is imperative
investors adhere to a disciplined investment approach that is consistent with
one's goals and objectives, being mindful of the tradeoff between risk and
return.

Since 1928 Pioneer's investment professionals have been focused on identifying
and capitalizing on investment opportunities that present themselves in a
variety of ever changing market conditions, including those we face today. We
seek returns consistent with our strategies' stated style and

objectives and consistent with our shareholders' expectations,
regardless of market conditions. We believe our shareowners benefit from the
experience and tenure of our investment teams, the insights generated from
extensive research resources and a commitment to prudent risk management
designed to mitigate downside and preserve returns over time.

We encourage you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall
investment plan that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to
implement such a plan in a disciplined manner, as we do when deploying
strategies on behalf of our shareowners.

We greatly appreciate your trust in us in the past and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ Lisa M. Jones

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/14

Floating-rate bank loans generated solid returns over the 12-month period ended
November 30, 2014, despite some market volatility over the final six months,
driven primarily by speculation over the timing of possible interest-rate hikes
and growing geopolitical risks. In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey
discusses the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate
Trust during the 12-month period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a
portfolio manager at Pioneer, is responsible for the day-to-day management of
the Trust.

Q   How did the Trust perform during the 12-month period ended November 30,
    2014?

A   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 4.74% at net asset value and -2.32% at
    market price during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2014. During the
    same 12-month period, the Trust's benchmark, the Barclays U.S. High Yield
    Loans Index (the Barclays Index), returned 3.35% at net asset value. Unlike
    the Trust, the Barclays Index does not use leverage. While the use of
    leverage increases investment opportunity, it also increases investment
    risk. During the same 12-month period, the average return (at market price)
    of the 22 closed end funds in Lipper's Loan Participation Funds category
    (which may or may not be leveraged) was -0.23%.

    The shares of the Trust were selling at an 11.4% discount to net asset value
    on November 30, 2014.

    On November 30, 2014, the Trust's standard 30-day SEC yield was 5.17%*.

Q   How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
    12-month period ended November 30, 2014?

A   While the investment environment changed within the period, bank-loan
    investments generated solid returns over the full 12 months. A supportive
    market backdrop stimulated investments in bank loans early in the period,
    but speculation about the timing of potential interest-rate increases as
    well as other factors resulted in a more unsettled market environment as the
    period progressed. However, the bank-loan market once again turned positive
    as the 12-month period drew to a close.

*   The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
    hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
    Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

4 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    During the first few months of the Trust's fiscal year, capital flowed into
    the bank-loan market as investors gained confidence in a growing domestic
    economy. The historically low default rates of bank loans and their
    potential to produce increased income in the event of rising interest rates
    also drove money into the market. In that environment, lower-rated bank
    loans tended to outperform higher-rated loans.

    The most positive news during the period came from the United States, where
    the domestic economy demonstrated resilience after contracting in the first
    quarter of 2014. In the U.S., gross domestic product (GDP) bounced back to
    grow at an annual rate of 4.6% in the second quarter and moved even higher
    (after a couple of revisions) in the third quarter. While growth in China
    continued to decelerate, the Chinese economy nevertheless grew at an annual
    pace of 7.5%. Meanwhile, world prices for petroleum took an unexpected dip
    late in the 12-month period, having both positive and negative effects on
    the global economy. Declining energy prices provided consumers with more
    resources to use for discretionary spending, but investments in some energy
    industry-related securities were negatively affected by the price decline.

    Market sentiment changed during the second half of the Trust's fiscal year
    amid a number of factors that appeared to threaten the health of the global
    economy. In part, investors were monitoring the potential economic effects
    of the U.S. Federal Reserve System's (the Fed's) decision to scale back and
    end its quantitative easing bond-purchasing program. In addition,
    geopolitical risks to the global economy increased as the period progressed.
    For instance, the economic sanctions imposed against Russia by the United
    States and several European countries due to Russia's aggression in the
    Ukraine began affecting not only the Russian economy, but also many European
    economies. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, increased violence and the rising
    influence of militant Islamist groups such as ISIS resulted in an escalation
    of U.S. military action, which created further uncertainty in the market.

    As those many developments occurred, global fixed-income markets became
    increasingly volatile. U.S. Treasuries, which still were perceived by many
    as the safest and most liquid asset class, rallied during the period. Prices
    rose as the 10-year Treasury yield declined during the 12-month period;
    however, bank loans and other credit-sensitive securities experienced some
    difficulties. Money started flowing out of the bank-loan market beginning in
    April 2014, when the Fed warned banks against

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 5
<PAGE>

    making riskier loans and investors began to anticipate that any
    interest-rate increases by the Fed might occur later than originally
    anticipated. The outflows continued for much of the final six months of the
    period, but were partially mitigated by new issuance of collateralized loan
    obligations, or CLOs. (CLOs are investment pools that invest in
    floating-rate loans.) By the end of the period, CLOs were projected to
    experience a record year for issuance in 2014, and that news provided
    further support for the loan asset class, even in the face of continued
    outflows from open-end investment companies. Over much of the second half
    of the Trust's fiscal year, the performance of higher-rated bank loans began
    improving relative to lower-rated loans, particularly loans rated CCC.

Q   How did you manage the Trust's portfolio during the 12-month period ended
    November 30, 2014, and how did your investment strategies, as well as
    individual investments, affect the Trust's performance?

A   In managing the Trust's portfolio during the fiscal year, we continued to
    overweight higher-quality bank loans as compared with the Barclays Index.
    While the emphasis on higher-rated loans held back the Trust's benchmark-
    relative performance early in the 12-month period, it proved to be
    advantageous for performance over most of the second half of the period as
    market volatility increased. As of November 30, 2014, the Trust was
    underweight in CCC-rated loans as compared with the benchmark (CCC-rated
    loans represented less than 4% of the Trust's total investment portfolio,
    compared to the benchmark weighting of 6.8%).

    The overwhelming majority of the Trust's total investment portfolio was made
    up of bank loans, but we also invested in CLOs, event-linked bonds issued by
    property and casualty insurers, and corporate bonds. Investments in each of
    those asset classes had positive effects on the Trust's relative results
    during the period.

    Overall, however, security selection had the greatest influence on the
    Trust's benchmark-relative returns. We maintained a focus on credit research
    and fundamental analysis when selecting loans for the portfolio.

    The better-performing individual positions in the Trust's portfolio during
    period included the debt of Allison Transmission, a manufacturer of
    automotive transmission systems, and loans to three health care industry
    companies: AccentCare, a home health care and hospice services provider;
    Gentiva, a home health care provider; and Virtual Radiologic, which operates
    a network of radiologist practices.

6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    Among the positions in the Trust's portfolio that underperformed during the
    period were loans to Media General, a broadcasting company; Community Health
    Systems, which operates a chain of rural hospitals; and CCS Medical, a
    medical device manufacturer. The portfolio also held positions in loans to
    several companies related to the oil industry, and those loans
    underperformed late in the period as global oil prices declined
    significantly; however, the negative influence of falling oil prices had
    less of an effect on the bank-loan market than on the high-yield bond
    market.

    During the period, the default rate of the Trust's investments remained
    significantly lower than that of the overall bank-loan market.

Q   Could you address the performance of the Trust with regard to its level of
    income-generation during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2014?

A   The Trust needed to lower its monthly (per share) distribution twice during
    the 12-month period, once in April and again in July. The reason for these
    reductions was that over the course of 2013, strong demand for the types of
    loans in which the Trust invests resulted in nearly 60% of these loans being
    refinanced at lower interest rates. Rates dropped significantly during this
    period. On average, rates dropped 70 basis points (bps), or 0.70%. In the
    early part of 2013, the Trust had built up income reserves which were able
    to compensate for the lower rates without requiring a reduction in the
    distribution. However, these reserves were exhausted by year-end 2013.
    Starting in early 2014, the effects of the re-financings on the Trust's
    income became apparent and the Trust was forced to cut its distribution in
    April. The re-financing trend continued into the first half of 2014, with
    rates falling again by another 28 bps, or 0.28%. These even lower rates,
    coupled with the Trust having a slightly higher-quality bias compared with
    the Barclays Index, resulted in a second reduction of the Trust's dividend
    in July.

    During the period ended November 30, 2014, the market saw an increase in the
    issuance of significantly higher-yielding second-lien loans, which are
    generally lower-rated (CCC/B-) loans. These types of loans outperformed the
    market on both an income and return basis during the 12-month period. The
    Trust was underweight in these types of loans, which also had a negative
    effect on investment income. It should be noted that in August the Trust's
    investment policies were altered to more closely align with the Barclays
    Index and the peer group. The new policies allow for more portfolio
    investments in second liens and non-U.S. securities. With the changes to
    the investment policies now in place, and given that U.S. GDP growth should
    provide a strong fundamental footing, there may be

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 7
<PAGE>

    opportunities to increase the Trust's future investment income by adding
    more risk exposure to the portfolio through investments in more single-B
    loans, second liens and international (non-U.S.) securities.

Q   How did the means of implementing leverage and the level of leverage in the
    Trust change during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2014?

A   The Trust historically employed leverage through the issuance of auction
    market preferred shares (AMPS). Between December 3, 2013 and December 6,
    2013, the Trust redeemed all of its outstanding AMPS. The Trust now employs
    leverage via a revolving credit facility (see Note 7 to the financial
    statements).

    The dollar amount of leverage employed by the Trust was reduced from $182.5
    million (on December 1, 2013) to $155.4 million in order to meet asset
    coverage requirements related to the revolving credit facility (see Note 7).
    At the end of the 12-month period on November 30, 2014, 32.9% of the Trust's
    total managed assets were financed by leverage obtained through the
    revolving credit facility, compared with 36.1% of the Trust's total managed
    assets financed by leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2013.

Q   Did the Trust have any exposure to derivative securities during the 12-month
    period ended November 30, 2014?

A   Yes, the Trust did invest in currency forward contracts during the period as
    part of our effort to reduce the risks associated with having exposure to
    non-U.S. securities. The positions in currency forward contracts had no
    notable impact on the Trust's results, and at the end of the period on
    November 30, 2014, the Trust's portfolio had no exposure to any derivative
    securities.

Q   What is your investment outlook?

A   We have a generally positive outlook for investing in floating-rate bank
    loans. We believe that the domestic economy will continue to expand and that
    corporate profits are likely to maintain their solid growth levels. That, in
    turn, should provide a favorable backdrop for investments in corporate debt,
    including bank loans.

    Notwithstanding the favorable outlook, we do recognize the potential for
    continued market volatility, primarily from factors outside the U.S., such
    as a weakening of growth trends in China and Europe and the rise of
    geopolitical risks (noted earlier) in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In
    addition, the recent, rapid decline in world oil prices could continue to
    have both positive and negative effects on the bank-loan market.

8 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    Currently, the market for bank loans is widely discounted, and that should
    give loans the potential for price appreciation. The discounted prices
    should be especially appealing in light of the fact that current default
    rates on bank loans are significantly lower than long-term historical
    averages. Finally, we believe bank loans could become even more attractive
    to investors if and when the Fed, eventually, begins to raise interest rates
    and loan yields start increasing as the floating-rate features of loans are
    activated.

    Of course, it is possible that interest rates may not rise, loan yields may
    not increase as anticipated, or, with continued strong U.S. economic
    growth, loan spreads (interest rates) could compress even further prior to
    any action by the Fed on interest rates. All of these scenarios could reduce
    the Trust's net earnings or returns to shareholders (dividend).

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 14-40 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing for purchasing or selling
securities; to attempt to increase the fund's return as a non-hedging strategy
that may be considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics.
Using derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains
when the market prices, interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves
behave in a way not anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can
increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of their value at
times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the market price of
illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment of the
Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

Historically, the Trust employed leverage through the issuance of preferred
shares. The Trust has redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares. The
Trust continues to employ leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage
creates significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 9
<PAGE>

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions, at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

*   The amount of distributions made to shareowners during the period was in
    excess of the net investment income earned by the Trust during the period.
    The Trust has accumulated undistributed net investment income which is part
    of the Trust's NAV. A portion of this accumulated net investment income was
    distributed to shareowners during the period. A decrease in distributions
    may have a negative effect on the market value of the Trust's shares.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less
total liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

* The Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index measures the performance of
high-yield loans. Since comparisons for the Barclays Index begin in 2006, the
chart assumes an initial investment of $10,065, which is equal to the Trust's
value at 12/30/2005.

** The CS Leveraged Loan Index (the CS Index) is a representative index of
tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The CS Index began in
January 1992. Comparisons to the Trust for the CS Index begin in 2004. The CS
Index was the Trust's benchmark through March 1, 2011, and was at that time
replaced by the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
Index). Because the historical performance of the Barclays Index dates back only
to 2005, after the inception of the Trust in 2004, the Trust will
continue to provide "Market Value of $10,000 Investment" comparisons for both
the CS Index and the Barclays Index.

Returns of both indices are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
The indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

+   Return for the CS Leveraged Loan Index covers the entire performance history
    of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (December 28, 2004 through November 30,
    2014). Return for the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index covers the
    maximum period for which that index's performance is available (December 30,
    2005 through November 30, 2014).

(Cat Bond)    Catastrophe bond is a high yield debt instrument that is usually
              insurance linked and meant to raise money in case of catastrophe.

(144A)        Security is exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the
              Securities Act of 1933. Such securities may be resold normally to
              qualified institutional buyers in a transaction exempt from
              registration. At November 30, 2014, the value of these securities
              amounted to $11,882,883, or 3.7% of total net assets applicable to
              common shareowners.

*             Senior secured floating rate loan interests in which the Trust
              invests generally pay interest at rates that are periodically
              redetermined by reference to a base lending plus a premium. These
              base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered by
              one or more major European banks, such as LIBOR (London InterBank
              Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
              United States banks, (iii) the rate of a certificate of deposit or
              (iv) other base lending rates used by commercial lenders. The
              interest rate shown is the rate accruing at November 30, 2014.

(a)           Floating rate note. The rate shown is the coupon rate at November
              30, 2014.

(b)           Security is in default and is non-income producing.

(c)           Indicates a security that has been deemed illiquid. As of
              November 30, 2014 the aggregate cost of illiquid securities in the
              Trust's portfolio was $15,435,826. As of that date, the aggregate
              value of illiquid securities in the Trust's portfolio of
              $10,852,979 represented 3.4% of total net assets applicable to
              common shareowners.

</TABLE>

For financial reporting purposes net unrealized depreciation on investments was

Purchases and sales of securities (excluding temporary cash investments) for the
year ended November 30, 2014 aggregated $287,378,030 and $292,424,606,
respectively.

Principal amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below.

     Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

     Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
                similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
                risks, etc.). See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

     Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
                assumptions in determining fair value of investments). See
                Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Generally, equity securities are categorized as Level 1, fixed income securities
and senior loans are categorized as Level 2, and securities valued using fair
value methods (other than prices supplied by independent pricing services or
broker-dealers) as Level 3. See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/14

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust
will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent
consistent with its primary objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
    loan interests (senior loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
    established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
    bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
    Loan Pricing Corporation, an independent pricing service. If price
    information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation or if the price
    information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
    from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
    quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing service
    broker quotes will be solicited. Fixed-income securities are valued at
    prices supplied by independent pricing services, which consider such factors
    as market prices, market events, quotations from one or more brokers,
    Treasury spreads, yields, maturities and ratings. Valuations may be
    supplemented by dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities
    that have traded on an exchange are valued at the last sale price on the
    principal exchange where they are traded. Equity securities that have not
    traded on the date of valuation or securities for

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 47
<PAGE>

    which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean
    between the last bid and asked prices. Shares of money market mutual funds
    are valued at such funds' net asset value.

    Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
    times prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The values
    of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's
    shares are determined as of such times.

    Securities and loans interests for which independent pricing services are
    unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are not
    readily available or are considered to be unreliable are valued by a fair
    valuation team comprised of certain personnel of Pioneer Investment
    Management, Inc. (PIM), the Trust's investment adviser, pursuant to
    procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation
    team uses fair value methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the
    Board of Trustees. PIM's valuation team is responsible for monitoring
    developments that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and
    assessing fair value on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
    Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

    Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may include
    credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current market
    conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value methods
    if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the close of
    the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to the
    determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
    event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
    natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation
    of the Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and
    such differences could be material.

    At November 30, 2014, there were no securities valued using fair value
    methods (other than securities valued using prices supplied by independent
    pricing services or broker-dealers).

B.  Investment Income and Transactions

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
    are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
    the exercise of reasonable diligence.

    Interest income, including interest on income bearing cash accounts, is
    recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at
    the applicable country rates.

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted or
    amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield
    to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost
    basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
    mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
    monthly paydowns.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
    represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
    currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
    between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

    The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
    the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
    future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
    exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
    are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records realized
    gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a closing
    transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise
    upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
    movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
    (see Note 5).

E.  Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
    shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As of
    November 30, 2014, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties with
    respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be recorded
    as

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 49
<PAGE>

    an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax returns filed
    within the prior three years remain subject to examination by federal and
    state tax authorities.

    The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
    shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
    which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
    Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
    temporary overdistributions for financial statement and tax purposes.
    Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent
    book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for
    temporary differences. At November 30, 2014, the Fund reclassified $305,381
    to decrease undistributed net investment income and $305,381 to decrease
    accumulated net realized loss on investments and foreign currency
    transactions to reflect permanent book/tax differences. These adjustments
    have no impact on the net assets or results of operations.

    At November 30, 2014, the Trust was permitted to carry forward $435,908 of
    short term and $16,327,086 of long term capital losses without limitation.
    Additionally, at November 30, 2014, the Trust had a net capital gain/(loss)
    carryforward of $120,602,379 of which the following amounts will expire
    between 2016 and 2019 if not utilized: $27,976,876 in 2016, $62,461,978 in
    2017, $11,415,660 in 2018 and $18,747,865 in 2019. Since unlimited losses
    are required to be used first, loss carryforwards that are subject to
    expiration may be more likely to expire unused.

    The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the years
    ended November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2014 were as follows:

    ============================================================================
</TABLE>

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
    primarily attributable to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the
    realization for tax purposes of unrealized gains on investments in passive
    foreign investment companies, the book/tax differences in the accrual of
    income on securities in default, the difference between book and tax
    amortization methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities
    and other book/tax temporary differences.

F.  Risks

    Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
    Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
    in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
    those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
    Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
    interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
    economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
    those industries and sectors.

    The Trust invests primarily in senior loans. The Trust may also invest in
    other floating and variable rate instruments, including second lien loans,
    investment grade fixed-income debt securities and high yield, high risk
    corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below investment grade
    securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly referred to as
    "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's
    capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Below investment grade
    securities, including floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are
    subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid and more difficult
    to value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
    higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
    that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if
    any, securing a floating rate loan can decline or may decline or may be
    insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to
    liquidate. No active trading market may exist for floating rate loans, and
    many loans are subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market may
    be subject to irregular trading activity and extended settlement periods.
    Additionally, the Trust may invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes
    are referred to as "insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. The return of
    principal and the payment of interest on event-linked bonds are contingent
    on the nonoccurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane
    or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. In addition to the specified
    trigger events, event-linked bonds may expose the Trust to other risks,
    including but not limited to issuer (credit) default, adverse regulatory or
    jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 51
<PAGE>

    The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
    developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in
    a developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
    conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
    currency exchange restrictions.

    The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
    invested in senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
    Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when
    the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is
    generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid
    securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the Trust's
    assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
    advantage of market opportunities.

G.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
    required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trust's custodian or a sub-custodian of the Trust. PIM is
    responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
    least equal to the repurchase price.

H.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
    automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
    Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
    of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in
    the Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends
    and capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
    completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
    penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
    shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
    any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
    effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
    distribution.

    If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
    other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
    the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
    the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
    or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in common shares of
    the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

    Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
    participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
    acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
    but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
    outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
    on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share
    is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
    trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend
    amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common
    shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing the
    dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the
    date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
    current market price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common
    share is greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent
    will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market
    purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued
    common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
    brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
    purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any
    federal, state or local taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any
    taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may not
    be able to transfer the shares to another broker and continue to participate
    in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not
include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the year ended November 30, 2014, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.04% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 53
<PAGE>

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At November 30,
2014, $336,077 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative
costs and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee payable" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at negotiated
rates.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Trust's custodian expenses. For the year ended November 30, 2014, the Trust
expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.

5. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

At November 30, 2014, the Trust had entered into various forward foreign
currency contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver or take delivery of
currencies at specified future maturity dates. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a forward foreign currency contract, the Trust may close out
such contract by entering into an offsetting contract. The average value of
contracts open during the year ended November 30, 2014 was $497,211. There were
no outstanding forward foreign currency contracts at November 30, 2014.

6. Unfunded and Bridge Loan Commitments

As of November 30, 2014, the Trust had no bridge loan commitments.

As of November 30, 2014, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments amounting to
$664,767 (excluding unrealized appreciation on the commitments of $6,153 as of
November 30, 2014) which could be extended at the option of the borrower,
pursuant to the following loan agreements:

7. Loan Agreement

Effective November 26, 2014, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all of the Trust's auction market preferred shares (see Note 10).
Effective November 29, 2014, the Trust extended the maturity of the credit
Agreement for a 12 month period.

At November 30, 2014, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $155,450,000. The interest rate charged at November 30, 2014
was 1.01%. During the year ended November 30, 2014, the average daily balance
was $156,392,149 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.02%. During the year
ended November 30, 2014, the maximum borrowing amount was $157,400,000. With
respect to the loan, interest expense of $1,589,732 is included in the Statement
of Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities, not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowings outstanding.

8. Trust Shares

There are an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial interest
authorized.

11. Dividends to Preferred Shareholders

Prior to the redemption of the Trust's AMPS (See Note 10), dividends on Series
M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 were cumulative at a rate which was to be reset
every seven days based on the results of an auction. Since February 2008, the
Trust's auctions related to the AMPS failed. Accordingly, the Trust paid the
maximum dividend rate for each series, which was the greater of

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

125% of the one week LIBOR rate or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. There
were no dividends payable on AMPS during the period from December 1, 2013 to the
redemption of Series M7 AMPS on December 3, 2013, Series W7 AMPS on December 5,
2013 and Series TH7 AMPS on December 6, 2013.

12. Subsequent Event

A monthly dividend was declared on December 2, 2014 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0550 per common share payable
December 18, 2014, to common shareowners of record on December 12, 2014.

13. Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Trustees of the Trust, with the approval and recommendation of the
Audit Committee, appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Trust's
independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending
November 30, 2014. Deloitte & Touche LLP replaces Ernst & Young LLP, which
resigned as the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm effective
upon completion of the audit of the Trust's financial statements for the fiscal
year ended November 30, 2013.

During the periods that Ernst & Young LLP served as the Trust's independent
registered public accounting firm, including the Trust's fiscal years ending
November 30, 2013 and November 30, 2012, Ernst & Young LLP's reports on the
financial statements of the Trust have not contained an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and have not been qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles. Further, there have been no disagreements
with Ernst & Young LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not
resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP would have caused Ernst &
Young LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
connection with its report on the financial statements. In addition, there have
been no reportable events of the kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), as of
November 30, 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in net
assets and cash flows and the financial highlights for year then ended. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. The statement
of changes in net assets of the Trust for the year ended November 30, 2013, and
the financial highlights for the years ended November 30, 2013, 2012, 2011, and
2010 were audited by other auditors. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and financial highlights in their report
dated January 24, 2014.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Trust
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of November 30, 2014, by correspondence with the
custodian, brokers and agent banks; where replies were not received from brokers
and agent banks, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust as of November 30, 2014, and the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, its cash flows and the financial
highlights for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its common
shares in the open market.

Changes to non-fundamental investment policies

Investments in floating rate loans. Effective August 1, 2014, the following
non-fundamental investment policy has been modified by removing references to
"senior" loans from the policy. The revised policy is as follows:

      Under normal market conditions, the Trust seeks to achieve its investment
      objectives by investing at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus
      borrowings for investment purposes) in floating rate loans.

Investments in non-U.S. securities. Effective August 1, 2014, the following
non-fundamental investment policy has been modified to increase the limit on
investments in non-U.S. securities from 10% to 35% of the Trust's assets. The
revised policy is as follows:

      The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets (net assets plus borrowings
      for investment purposes) in floating rate loans and other securities of
      non-U.S. issuers, including emerging markets securities.

Risks of investing in floating rate loans. Floating rate loans typically are
rated below investment grade (debt securities rated below investment grade are
commonly referred to as "junk bonds"). The fund's investments in floating rate
loans may include unsecured or subordinated loans. Floating rate loans and
similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments. No
active trading market may exist for many floating rate loans, and many loans are
subject to restrictions on resale. Market quotations for these securities may be
volatile and/or subject to large spreads between bid and ask prices. Any
secondary market may be subject to irregular trading activity and extended trade
settlement periods. An economic downturn generally leads to a higher non-payment
rate, and a loan may lose significant value before a default occurs. There is
less readily available, reliable information about loans than is the case for
other types of securities. Although the features of loans, including

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 59
<PAGE>

typically being secured by collateral and having priority over other obligations
of the issuer, reduce some of the risks of investment in below investment grade
securities, the loans are subject to significant risks. Certain floating rate
loans and other corporate debt securities involve refinancings,
recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, and other financings for general
corporate purposes. Other loans are incurred in restructuring or "work-out"
scenarios, including debtor-in-possession facilities in bankruptcy. Loans to
highly leveraged companies are especially vulnerable to adverse economic or
market conditions and the risk of default.

Risks of second lien and other subordinated securities. Second lien loans
generally are subject to similar risks as those associated with senior (first
lien) loans. Because second lien loans are subordinated and thus lower in
priority on payment to senior loans, they are subject to the additional risk
that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan or debt, if
any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the
senior secured obligations of the borrower. This risk is generally higher for
subordinated unsecured loans or debt, which are not backed by a security
interest in any specific collateral. Second lien loans generally have greater
price volatility than senior loans and may be less liquid. Second lien loans and
other subordinated securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than
non-subordinated securities of the same issuer, any loss incurred by the
subordinated securities is likely to be proportionately greater, and any
recovery of interest or principal may take more time. As a result, even a
perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer is likely to have a greater
impact on them.

Risks of non-U.S. investments. Investing in non-U.S. issuers, or in U.S. issuers
that have significant exposure to foreign markets, may involve unique risks
compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers. These risks are more
pronounced for issuers in emerging markets or to the extent that the fund
invests significantly in one region or country. These risks may include
different financial reporting practices and regulatory standards, less liquid
trading markets, extreme price volatility, currency risks, changes in economic,
political, regulatory and social conditions, sustained economic downturns,
financial instability, tax burdens, and investment and repatriation
restrictions. Lack of information and less market regulation also may affect the
value of these securities. Withholding and other non-U.S. taxes may decrease the
fund's return. Non-U.S. issuers may be located in parts of the world that have
historically been prone to natural disasters. Investing in depositary receipts
is subject to many of the same risks as investing directly in non-U.S. issuers.
Depository receipts may involve higher expenses and may trade at a discount (or
premium) to the underlying security.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) serves as the investment adviser to
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between PIM and the Trust. In order for PIM to remain the investment
adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine annually whether
to renew the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in January 2014 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the process.
Contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in March 2014 and July
2014. Supplemental contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in
September 2014. In addition, the Trustees reviewed and discussed the Trust's
performance at regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year, and took into
account other information related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at
regularly scheduled meetings, in connection with the review of the Trust's
investment advisory agreement.

In March 2014, the Trustees, among other things, discussed the memorandum
provided by Trust counsel that summarized the legal standards and other
considerations that are relevant to the Trustees in their deliberations
regarding the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, and reviewed and
discussed the qualifications of the investment management teams, as well as the
level of investment by the Trust's portfolio manager in the Trust. In July 2014,
the Trustees, among other things, reviewed the Trust's management fee and total
expense ratios, the financial statements of PIM and its parent companies, the
profitability analyses provided by PIM, and possible economies of scale. The
Trustees also reviewed the profitability of the institutional business of PIM
and PIM's affiliate, Pioneer Institutional Asset Management, Inc. (together with
PIM, "Pioneer"), as compared to that of PIM's fund management business, and
considered the differences between the fees and expenses of the Trust and the
fees and expenses of Pioneer's institutional accounts, as well as the different
services provided by PIM to the Trust and by Pioneer to the institutional
accounts. The Trustees further considered contract review materials in September
2014.

At a meeting held on September 16, 2014, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the Independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for another year. In considering
the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees considered
various factors that they determined were relevant, including the factors
described below. In all quintile rankings referred to throughout this

62 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14
<PAGE>

disclosure, first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's shareowners. The
Trustees did not identify any single factor as the controlling factor in
determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by PIM to the Trust, taking into account the investment objective
and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees reviewed the terms of the investment
advisory agreement. The Trustees also reviewed PIM's investment approach for the
Trust and its research process. The Trustees considered the resources of PIM and
the personnel of PIM who provide investment management services to the Trust.
They also reviewed the amount of non-Trust assets managed by the portfolio
manager of the Trust. The Trustees considered the non-investment resources and
personnel of PIM involved in PIM's services to the Trust, including PIM's
compliance and legal resources and personnel. The Trustees noted the substantial
attention and high priority given by PIM's senior management to the Pioneer fund
complex.

The Trustees considered that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including Trust
officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by PIM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement.

Performance of the Trust

In considering the Trust's performance, the Trustees regularly review and
discuss analysis and data prepared by PIM and information comparing the Trust's
performance with the performance of its peer group of funds as classified by
each of Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar) and Lipper, and with the performance of
the Trust's benchmark index. They also discussed the Trust's performance with
PIM on a regular basis. The Trustees confirmed that these regular reviews and
discussions were factored into the Trustees' deliberations concerning the
renewal of the advisory agreement. For purposes of their contract renewal
deliberations, the Trustees considered the discussions held throughout the year
regarding the Trust's performance and the performance results of the Trust over
various time periods, including the Trust's

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/14 63
<PAGE>

performance results for periods ended June 30, 2014. The Trustee's noted during
the course of their review that the Trust had underperformed its benchmark index
for certain periods. The Trustees indicated that they were satisfied with PIM's
investment discipline and approach in the prevailing market conditions, together
with changes made during the period in certain non-fundamental policies,
notwithstanding relatively poor peer comparisons of total return at market value
over the 1- and 3-year periods.

Management Fee and Expenses

The Trustees considered information showing the fees and expenses of the Trust
in comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the Independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee (based on managed
assets) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 was in the first quintile
relative to the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight
peer group for the comparable period. The Trustees considered that the expense
ratio (based on managed assets) of the Trust's common shares for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2014 was in the first quintile relative its Strategic
Insight peer group, in each case for the comparable period.

The Trustees reviewed management fees charged by Pioneer to institutional and
other clients, including publicly offered European funds sponsored by affiliates
of Pioneer, unaffiliated U.S. registered investment companies (in a sub-advisory
capacity), and unaffiliated foreign and domestic separate accounts. The Trustees
also considered PIM's costs in providing services to the Trust and Pioneer's
costs in providing services to the other clients and considered the differences
in management fees and profit margins for Trust and non-Trust services. In
evaluating the fees associated with Pioneer's client accounts, the Trustees took
into account the respective demands, resources and complexity associated with
the Trust and client accounts. The Trustees noted that, in some instances, the
fee rates for those clients were lower than the management fee for the Trust and
considered that, under the investment advisory agreement with the Trust, PIM
performs additional services for the Trust that it does not provide to those
other clients or services that are broader in scope, including oversight of the
Trust's other service providers and activities related to compliance and the
extensive regulatory and tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The Trustees
also considered the different entrepreneurial risks associated with PIM's
management of the Trust and Pioneer's management of the other client accounts.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to PIM was
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided by PIM
to the Trust.

Profitability

The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses.
The Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in
comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that the
profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its
organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees
concluded that PIM's profitability with respect to the management of the Trust
was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale

The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is a
closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees concluded
that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the renewal of the
investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits

The Trustees considered the other benefits to PIM from its relationship with the
Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services provided
by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and
profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business. Pioneer is the
principal U.S. asset management business of Pioneer Global Asset Management, the
worldwide asset management business of UniCredit Group, which manages over $150
billion in assets (including the Funds). Pioneer and the Funds receive
reciprocal intangible benefits from the relationship, including mutual brand
recognition and, for the Funds, direct and indirect access to the resources of a
large global asset manager. The Trustees concluded that any such benefits
received by Pioneer as a result of its relationship with the Funds were
reasonable and their consideration of the advisory agreement between the Trust
and PIM and the fees thereunder were unaffected by Pioneer's possible receipt of
any such intangible benefits.

Conclusion

After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors, the
Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into
on or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the new
SEC pre-approval rules, the Trust's audit committee is
required to pre-approve services to affiliates defined by
SEC rules to the extent that the services are determined
to have a direct impact on the operations or financial
reporting of the Trust. For the years ended November 30, 2014
and 2013, there were no services provided to an affiliate
that required the Trust's audit committee pre-approval.

(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountants engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrants accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrants
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust were $9,876
payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP for the year ended
November 30, 2014 and $17,781 were paid to the former
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP for the year ended November 30,
2013.

(h) Disclose whether the registrants audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrants investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Trust's audit committee of the Board of Fundees has
considered whether the provision of non-audit services
that were rendered to the Affiliates (as defined) that were
not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

so state.

N/A

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
When a portfolio manager is responsible for the management of more than one
account, the potential arises for the portfolio manager to favor one account
over another. The principal types of potential conflicts of interest that may
arise are discussed below. For the reasons outlined below, Pioneer does not
believe that any material conflicts are likely to arise out of a portfolio
manager's responsibility for the management of the fund as well as one or more
other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted procedures that it believes are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal securities
laws and to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest to affect its
portfolio management decisions, there can be no assurance that all conflicts
will be identified or that all procedures will be effective in mitigating the
potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of such conflicts of interest
are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager has a financial incentive
to favor one account over another. Pioneer has structured its compensation
arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit such potential for conflicts
of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio Managers" below.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating new
  investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial public
  offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial public
  offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly shortly
  after the offering was allocated to a single account, that account may be
  expected to have better investment performance than other accounts that did
  not receive an allocation of the initial public offering. Generally,
  investments for which there is limited availability are allocated based upon
  a range of factors including available cash and consistency with the
  accounts' investment objectives and policies. This allocation methodology
  necessarily involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
  opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata basis.
  Although Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably designed to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there may be instances
  where a fund may not participate, or may participate to a lesser degree than
  other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
  which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager determines
  to purchase a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that
  may influence the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or
  sold the security first may receive a more favorable price than accounts
  that made subsequent transactions. The less liquid the market for the
  security or the greater the percentage that the proposed aggregate purchases
  or sales represent of average daily trading volume, the greater the
  potential for accounts that make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a
  less favorable price. When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same
  security on the same day for more than one account, the trades typically are
  "bunched," which means that the trades for the individual accounts are
  aggregated and each account receives the same price. There are some types of
  accounts as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons
  (such as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise
  where the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
  best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as favorable
  a price as possible for such client.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
  compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater degree
  than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for example, the
  portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the performance of certain
  accounts relative to a benchmark while other accounts are disregarded for
  this purpose, the portfolio manager will have a financial incentive to seek
  to have the accounts that determine the portfolio manager's bonus achieve
  the best possible performance to the possible detriment of other accounts.
  Similarly, if Pioneer receives a performance-based advisory fee, the
  portfolio manager may favor that account, whether or not the performance of
  that account directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has a
  beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client or to
  compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the portfolio
  manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was one of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio manager would have
  an economic incentive to favor the account in which the portfolio manager
  held an interest.

o If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
  investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise. For
  example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account and
  sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern may
  disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making portfolio
  manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially conflicting
  situations. However, where a portfolio manager is responsible for accounts
  with differing investment objectives and policies, it is possible that the
  portfolio manager will conclude that it is in the best interest of one
  account to sell a portfolio security while another account continues to hold
  or increase the holding in such security.


COMPENSATION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation for portfolio managers that seeks
to align the financial interests of the portfolio managers with those of
shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer funds) the portfolio managers
manage, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. The compensation
program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes a base salary (determined
by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual bonus program, as well as
customary benefits that are offered generally to all full-time employees. Base
compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an annual basis. Pioneer
seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking into account the
experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The bonus plan is
intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation that is
tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment performance and
align the interests of the investment professional with those of shareholders,
as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus under the plan
is completely discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may be in excess
of base salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the following
factors:

o QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The quantitative investment performance
  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of all of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the fund and any
  other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-year period (20%
  weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting), measured for periods ending
  on December 31. The accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a
  group of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and investment
  focus (60%) and a broad-based securities market index measuring the
  performance of the same type of securities in which the accounts invest
  (40%), which, in the case of the fund, is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
  High Yield Master II Index. As a result of these two benchmarks, the
  performance of the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured
  against the criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's
  competitive universe.

o QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE. The qualitative performance component with respect
  to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager includes objectives,
  such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork, leadership, communications
  and marketing, that are mutually established and evaluated by each portfolio
  manager and management.

o PIONEER RESULTS AND BUSINESS LINE RESULTS. Pioneer's financial performance,
  as well as the investment performance of its investment management group,
  affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a leverage factor of plus or
  minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers participate in other programs designed to reward and
retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees are granted
performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and the
financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of
Regulation S-R(17 CFR 229.407)(as required by Item 22(b)(15))
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.

shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-R of Schedule 14(A)
in its definitive proxy statement, or this item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive and
principal financials officers, or persons performing similar functions,
regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report
that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph,
based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule
30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30(a)-3(b) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure

procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose any change in the registrant's internal control over financial

reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund, with the approval
and recommendation of the Audit Committee,
appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Fund's
independent registered public accounting firm for the
fiscal year ending November 30, 2014. Deloitte & Touche LLP
replaces Ernst & Young LLP, which resigned as the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm,
effective upon completion of the audit of the Fund's
financial statements for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2013.

During the periods that Ernst & Young LLP served as the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm,
including the Fund's fiscal years ending November 30, 2013
and November 30, 2012, Ernst & Young LLP's reports on the
financial statements of the Fund have not contained an
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and have not
been qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles. Further, there have
been no disagreements with Ernst & Young LLP on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst &
Young LLP would have caused Ernst & Young LLP to
make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement in connection with its report on the
financial statements. In addition, there have been no
reportable events of the kind described in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

<PAGE>

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
