A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets began 2006 with a return to volatility following a fairly
uninspiring 2005. For the six- and 12-month periods ended February 28, 2006,
most major market indexes landed in positive territory:

</TABLE>

The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) increased interest rates 200 basis points
(2.00%) over the past 12 months, bringing the target federal funds rate to 4.5%.
Notably, Ben Bernanke replaced Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman in January, a
month after the central bank removed the critical word "measured" from the
description of its rate-hiking program. Still, most observers expect at least
one more interest rate hike before the Fed pauses in its tightening campaign.

U.S. economic growth, which came in at 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005, fell
to 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Growth is expected to reaccelerate in the first
quarter of 2006, although the economy is likely to feel some pressure in the
quarters ahead as the consumer sector seems to be softening. Capital spending by
businesses, however, appears relatively strong. Overall corporate health,
including strong company balance sheets, helped prompt robust
dividend-distribution, share-buyback and merger-and-acquisition activity in
2005, a trend that has continued in 2006. This, as well as reasonably good
company earnings and low core inflation, has been supportive of U.S. stocks
despite the headwinds of rising interest rates and high energy prices. Many
international equity markets have fared even better, thanks in part to higher
economic growth rates and low inflation.

In the U.S. bond market, short-term interest rates continued to move higher as
longer-term interest rates advanced more moderately. After flattening
dramatically in 2005, the Treasury curve recently has been toying with bouts of
inversion, whereby short-term yields have surpassed long-term yields. At
period-end, the six-month Treasury bill offered the highest yield on the curve
at 4.74%.

Amid the uncertainty inherent in the financial markets, we encourage you to
review your goals periodically with your financial advisor and to make portfolio
changes, as needed. For timely "food for thought" for investors, we also invite
you to visit Shareholder magazine at www.mlim.ml.com/shareholdermagazine. As
always, we thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your
investment assets, and we look forward to continuing to serve your investment
needs.

                                    Sincerely,


                                    /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      The Fund maintained an above-average distribution rate throughout the
period, and our commitment to providing shareholders with attractive income
continues to drive portfolio activity.

Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past six months, long-term bond yields generally rose as their prices,
which move in the opposite direction, declined. Investors appeared to disregard
signs of slowing economic growth, reflected in gross domestic product growth of
just 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005, and instead focused on potential
inflationary pressures and continued short-term interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). In addition to inflationary fears sparked by
elevated commodity prices, national hourly wage levels rose recently. This led
some economic analysts to suggest that recent declines in the national
unemployment rate will result in escalating wage inflation. The resurgent
inflationary fears helped push bond yields higher over the past six months.

For its part, the Fed has continued to raise short-term interest rates at each
of its meetings during the period, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.5%.
Given little expectation that the Fed's monetary tightening cycle will end in
early 2006, the yield curve continued to flatten with shorter interest rates
increasing more than longer ones. At the end of February 2006, 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond yields had risen 25 basis points (.25%) to 4.51%, while 10-year
Treasury yields rose 53 basis points to 4.55% and two-year Treasury yields rose
85 basis points to 4.69%. The result was an inverted Treasury yield curve.

Notably, the municipal yield curve has maintained a positive slope. According to
Municipal Market Data, AAA-rated tax-exempt bonds maturing in 30 years saw their
yields increase eight basis points to 4.30%, while yields on AAA-rated issues
maturing in 10 years increased 25 basis points to end the period at 3.75%. The
tax-exempt market's positive technical position has allowed municipal bond
prices to decline less than those of taxable bonds.

Supporting the recent outperformance of the municipal bond market has been a
dramatic slowdown in the issuance of new long-term tax-exempt bonds. During
calendar year 2005, more than $408 billion in new long-term tax-exempt bonds was
underwritten, representing a new annual record and an increase of over 13%
compared to 2004. For the six-month period ended February 28, 2006, $172 billion
in long-term municipal bonds was issued, a decline of 1.5% compared to the same
period a year ago. More recently, new-issue volume has declined at an even
faster rate. In the past three months, $76 billion in new long-term tax-exempt
bonds were marketed, a decline of 16% compared to the same three months a year
ago. The record level of new issuance in 2005 was largely triggered by a 47%
increase in refunding activity as issuers took advantage of historically low
bond yields and a flattening yield curve to refinance outstanding
higher-couponed debt. So far in 2006, refunding issuance has declined more than
55% relative to the first two months of 2005. It remains to be seen if this
decline is the beginning of a sustained trend toward a significant decline in
refunding issuance. This is important, as analysts' estimates for new-issue
supply for 2006, currently in the $340 billion - $370 billion range, are largely
dependant on modest declines in refunding activity. Should the current trend
continue, new-issue supply projections for this year could be adjusted lower.

Investor demand for municipal product has remained strong in recent quarters. As
reported by the Investment Company Institute (ICI), for all of 2005, long-term
municipal bond funds received net new monies of $5.04 billion. This represented
a sharp reversal from the $3.67 billion outflow seen in 2004. January 2006 data
from ICI indicates that tax-exempt mutual funds have continued to experience
positive cash flows, receiving over $2 billion for the month, more than twice
the net new monies received in January 2005.

Looking ahead, the fundamentals for the tax-exempt bond market appear favorable,
and continued positive cash flows are anticipated. Given their attractive yields
relative to comparable U.S. Treasury bonds, and the prospects for reduced
issuance in 2006, we believe municipal bonds could enjoy solid results in the
coming months.

How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2006, the Common Stock of MuniVest
Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 6.30% and 6.62%, based on a period-end
per share net asset value of $9.99 and a per share market price of $9.50,
respectively, and $.312 per share income dividends. Over the same period, the
total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +.90%, based on a change
in per share net asset value from $10.23 to $9.99, and assuming reinvestment of
all distributions.


4      MUNIVEST FUND, INC.                      FEBRUARY 28, 2006
<PAGE>

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, lagged the +1.44% average
return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) category for the
six-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest primarily in municipal
debt issues rated in the top four credit-rating categories. These funds can be
leveraged via use of debt, preferred equity and/or reverse repurchase
agreements.) However, the Fund's six-month annualized distribution yield of
6.56% was well above the 5.76% median of its peers in the Lipper category.

Despite the attractive yield, the Fund's underperformance on a total return
basis is largely attributable to the portfolio's considerable exposure to the
intermediate sector of the municipal yield curve, an area that underperformed as
the curve flattened. The Fund's exposure to the intermediate sector largely
results from both its derivative position and the natural maturation of the
portfolio. That is, as time progresses, many of the Fund's holdings are
prerefunded to shorter call dates while other issues become priced to shorter
and shorter call dates, resulting in the increased exposure to intermediate
maturities.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Despite the Fund's considerable exposure to bonds in the intermediate maturity
range, we opted to avoid a wholesale restructuring of the portfolio. While such
a restructuring would have resulted in a longer average portfolio maturity and
greater exposure to the long end of the tax-exempt yield curve, it also would
likely have entailed the sale of older prerefunded bonds and other
larger-couponed issues that were acquired in much higher interest rate
environments. These bonds provide a meaningful income benefit to the portfolio,
and their sale could result in material taxable gains as well as declines in the
Fund's dividend stream -- and, eventually, a reduced dividend payout.

We believe that, with the Fed potentially ending its monetary tightening cycle
by mid-2006, the flattening of the tax-exempt yield curve should subside and the
curve should begin to steepen. Under this scenario, the Fund's exposure to the
intermediate sector could once again become a positive contributor to overall
performance as well as generate significant incremental income.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2006, the Fund's Auction Market
Preferred Stock (AMPS) had average yields as follows: Series A, 2.72%; Series B,
3.14%; Series C, 2.94%; Series D, 2.84%; Series E, 2.82%; and Series F, 2.83%.
The Fed's four quarter point interest rate hikes during the period resulted in a
concurrent increase in the Fund's borrowing costs. Given that the Fed may be
nearing the end of its interest rate tightening cycle, additional increases in
the portfolio's borrowing costs are likely to be limited. Despite the most
recent interest rate increases, the tax-exempt yield curve has maintained its
positive slope, thereby continuing to generate an income benefit to the holders
of Common Stock from the leveraging of Preferred Stock. Of course, should the
spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of
leveraging will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common
Stock. At the end of the period, the Fund's leverage amount, due to AMPS, was
35.29% of total net assets, before the deduction of Preferred Stock. (For a more
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 6 of this
report to shareholders.)

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

By period-end, we had adopted a more positive outlook on the municipal market.
In our view, the end of the Fed's long interest rate-hiking campaign, combined
with continued modest economic growth and inflationary pressures, should promote
a gradual improvement in tax-exempt bond prices later this year. Having said
that, we would view signs of accelerated economic activity and/or rising wage
pressures as a signal to return to a more defensive positioning.

We intend to maintain the Fund's fully invested stance in an effort to enhance
shareholders' income stream. Our commitment to maintaining the Fund's already
attractive distribution yield is likely to be the main driver of portfolio
activity in the coming months.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments,
net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the
form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio holdings is reflected in the
per share net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to
benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve must be positively sloped;
that is, short-term interest rates must be lower than long-term interest rates.
At the same time, a period of generally declining interest rates will benefit
Common Stock shareholders. If either of these conditions change, then the risks
of leveraging will begin to outweigh the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in these securities. As of February 28, 2006, the percentage of the
Fund's total net assets invested in inverse floaters was 12.23%, before the
deduction of Preferred Stock.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts in
which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market
value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for periodic
payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in market
value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements may be used
to obtain or reduce exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the party
with whom the Fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to
pay the Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations
to pay the other party to the agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the
results for the interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MVF. The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price
in the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general direction
of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures contracts
and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing
prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are
valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the
case of options traded in the OTC market, valuation is the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements are
valued by quoted fair values received daily by the Fund's pricing service.
Short-term investments with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value, under which method the
investment is valued at cost and any premium or discount is amortized on a
straight line basis to maturity. Investments in open-end investment companies
are valued at their net asset value each business day. Securities and other
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
      Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
      is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the
      liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market
      value of the option written. When a security is purchased or sold through
      an exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or received) is added
      to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from
      (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires
      (or the Fund enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain
      or loss on the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or
      gain or loss to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the
      premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

o     Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund may enter into forward interest
      rate swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty
      agree to make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract
      amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
      earlier. When the agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss in an amount equal to the value of the agreement.

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(f) Offering costs -- Direct expenses relating to the public offering of the
Fund's Preferred Stock were charged to capital.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund pays a monthly fee at
an annual rate of .50% of the Fund's average daily net assets, including assets
acquired from the sale of Preferred Stock. The Investment Adviser has agreed to
waive its management fee by the amount of management fees the Fund pays to FAM
indirectly through its investment in the Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt
Fund.

In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S")
received $875 in commissions on the execution of portfolio security transactions
for the Fund for the six months ended February 28, 2006.

For the six months ended February 28, 2006, the Fund reimbursed FAM $10,278 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, and/or ML & Co.

In February 2006, ML & Co. and BlackRock, Inc. entered into an agreement to
merge ML & Co.'s investment management business, including FAM, with the
investment management business of BlackRock, Inc. The transaction is expected to
close in the third quarter of 2006.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the six
months ended February 28, 2006 were $237,057,563 and $241,888,146, respectively.

4. Capital Stock Transactions:

Common Stock

At February 28, 2006, the Fund had one class of shares of Common Stock, par
value $.10 per share, of which 150,000,000 shares were authorized.

Shares issued and outstanding for the six months ended February 28, 2006
increased by 71,644 as a result of dividend reinvestment. Shares issued and
outstanding for the year ended August 31, 2005 remained constant.

Preferred Stock

Auction Market Preferred Stock are redeemable shares of Preferred Stock of the
Fund with a par value of $.025 per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000
per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, that entitle their holders to
receive cash dividends at an annual rate that may vary for the successive
dividend periods for each series. The Fund is authorized to issue 10,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock. The yields in effect at February 28, 2006 were as
follows: Series A, 3.13%; Series B, 3.28%; Series C, 3.08%; Series D, 2.95%;
Series E, 2.85%; and Series F, 3.12%.

The Fund pays commissions to certain broker-dealers at the end of each auction
at an annual rate ranging from .25% to .375% calculated on the proceeds of each
auction. For the six months ended February 28, 2006, MLPF&S received $181,475 as
commissions.

5. Capital Loss Carryforward:

On August 31, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of $20,303,047,
of which $2,623,164 expires in 2008 and $17,679,883 expires in 2009. This amount
will be available to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.

6. Subsequent Event:

The Fund paid a tax-exempt income dividend to holders of Common Stock in the
amount of $.048000 per share on March 30, 2006 to shareholders of record on
March 14, 2006.

Dividend Policy

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more stable level of dividend distributions, the Fund may at
times pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any
particular month and may at times in any particular month pay out such
accumulated but undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned
in that month. As a result, the dividends paid by the Fund for any particular
month may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the
Fund during such month. The Fund's current accumulated but undistributed net
investment income, if any, is disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which
comprises part of the financial information included in this report.

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement

Activities of and Composition of the Board of Directors

All but one member of the Board of Directors is an independent director whose
only affiliation with Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the "Investment Adviser") or
other Merrill Lynch affiliates is as a director of the Fund and certain other
funds advised by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates. The Chairman of the
Board is also an independent director. New director nominees are chosen as
nominees by a Nominating Committee comprised of independent directors. All
independent directors also are members of the Board's Audit Committee and the
independent directors meet in executive session at each in-person Board meeting.
The Board and the Audit Committee meet in person for at least two days each
quarter and conduct other in-person and telephone meetings throughout the year,
some of which are formal board meetings, and some of which are informational
meetings. The independent counsel to the independent directors attends all
in-person Board and Audit Committee meetings and other meetings at the
independent directors' request.

Investment Advisory Agreement -- Matters Considered by the Board

Every year, the Board considers approval of the Fund's investment advisory
agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). The Board assesses the nature,
scope and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the personnel of the
Investment Adviser and its affiliates, including administrative services,
shareholder services, oversight of fund accounting, marketing services and
assistance in meeting legal and regulatory requirements. The Board also receives
and assesses information regarding the services provided to the Fund by certain
unaffiliated service providers.

At various times throughout the year, the Board also considers a range of
information in connection with its oversight of the services provided by the
Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Among the matters considered are: (a)
fees (in addition to management fees) paid to the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates by the Fund; (b) Fund operating expenses paid to third parties; (c)
the resources devoted to and compliance reports relating to the Fund's
investment objective, policies and restrictions, and its compliance with its
Code of Ethics and the Investment Adviser's compliance policies and procedures;
and (d) the nature, cost and character of non-investment management services
provided by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates.

The Board believes that the Investment Adviser is one of the most experienced
global asset management firms and considers the overall services provided by the
Investment Adviser to be of high quality. The Board also believes that the
Investment Adviser is financially sound and well managed and notes that the
Investment Adviser is affiliated with one of America's largest financial firms.
The Board works closely with the Investment Adviser in overseeing the Investment
Adviser's efforts to achieve good performance. As part of this effort, the Board
discusses portfolio manager effectiveness and, when performance is not
satisfactory, discusses with the Investment Adviser taking steps such as
changing investment personnel.

Annual Consideration of Approval by the Board of Directors

In the period prior to the Board meeting to consider renewal of the Investment
Advisory Agreement, the Board requests and receives materials specifically
relating to the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement. These materials include
(a) information compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") on the fees and expenses,
investment performance, and leverage of the Fund as compared to a comparable
group of funds as classified by Lipper; (b) information comparing the Fund's
market price with its net asset value per share; (c) a discussion by the Fund's
portfolio management team of investment strategies used by the Fund during its
most recent fiscal year; (d) information on the profitability to the Investment
Adviser and its affiliates of the Investment Advisory Agreement and other
relationships with the Fund; and (e) information provided by the Investment
Adviser concerning investment advisory fees charged to other retail closed-end
funds under similar investment mandates. The Board also considers other matters
it deems important to the approval process such as payments made to the
Investment Adviser or its affiliates in connection with services related to the
valuation and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings, the Fund's portfolio turnover
statistics, and direct and indirect benefits to the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates from their relationship with the Fund. The Board did not identify any

Certain Specific Renewal Data

In connection with the most recent renewal of the Fund's Investment Advisory
Agreement in February, 2006, the independent directors' and Board's review
included the following:

Services Provided by the Investment Adviser -- The Board reviewed the nature,
extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Adviser, including the
investment advisory services and the resulting performance of the Fund. The

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement (concluded)

Board focused primarily on the Investment Adviser's investment advisory services
and the Fund's investment performance. The Board compared Fund performance --
both including and excluding the effects of the Fund's fees and expenses -- to
the performance of a comparable group of funds. While the Board reviews
performance data at least quarterly, consistent with the Investment Adviser's
investment goals, the Board attaches more importance to performance over
relatively long periods of time, typically three to five years. Relative to
closed-end leveraged general municipal debt funds deemed comparable by the
Investment Adviser, the Fund's performance after fees and expenses ranked in the
second quintile for each of the one- and three-year periods ended November 30,
2005 and in the first quintile for the five-year period ended November 30, 2005.
The Board also considered the Fund's performance based on annualized yields and
noted that the Fund's yield for the year ended November 30, 2005 was in the
first quintile, in the second quintile for 2004, and in the third quintile for
2001 - 2003. Considering these factors, the Board concluded that the Fund's
performance supported the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement.

The Investment Adviser's Personnel and Investment Process -- The Board reviews
at least annually the Fund's investment objectives and strategies. The Board
discusses with senior management of the Investment Adviser responsible for
investment operations and the senior management of the Investment Adviser's
municipal investing group the strategies being used to achieve the stated
objectives. Among other things, the Board considers the size, education and
experience of the Investment Adviser's investment staff, its use of technology,
and the Investment Adviser's approach to training and retaining portfolio
managers and other research, advisory and management personnel. The Board also
reviews the Investment Adviser's compensation policies and practices with
respect to the Fund's portfolio managers. The Board also considered the
experience of the Fund's portfolio manager and noted that Mr. Stuebe has more
than 15 years of experience in portfolio management. The Investment Adviser and
its investment staff have extensive experience in analyzing and managing the
types of investments used by the Fund. The Board concluded that the Fund
benefits from that expertise.

Management Fees and Other Expenses -- The Board reviews the Fund's contractual
management fee rate and actual management fee rate as a percentage of total
assets at common asset levels -- the actual rate includes advisory and
administrative service fees and the effects of any fee waivers -- compared to
the other funds considered comparable by Lipper. It also compares the Fund's
total expenses to those of other comparable funds. The Board considered the
services provided to and the fees charged by the Investment Adviser to other
retail closed-end funds with similar investment mandates and noted that the fees
charged by the Investment Adviser in those cases typically exceeded those being
charged to the Fund. The Fund's contractual and actual management fee rates as
well as its actual total expense ratio, including investment-related expenses,
were below the median of management fees charged by comparable funds as
determined by Lipper. The Board has concluded that the Fund's management fee and
fee rate and overall expense ratio are reasonable compared to those of other
comparable funds.

Profitability -- The Board considers the cost of the services provided to the
Fund by the Investment Adviser, and the Investment Adviser's and its affiliates'
profits relating to the management of the Fund and the MLIM/FAM-advised funds.
As part of its analysis, the Board reviewed the Investment Adviser's methodology
in allocating its costs to the management of the Fund and concluded that there
was a reasonable basis for the allocation. The Board also considered the federal
court decisions discussing an investment adviser's profitability and
profitability levels considered to be reasonable in those decisions. The Board
concluded that the Investment Adviser's profits are acceptable in relation to
the nature and quality of services provided and given the level of fees and
expenses overall.

Economies of Scale -- The Board considered the extent to which economies of
scale might be realized as the assets of the Fund increase and whether there
should be changes in the management fee rate or structure in order to enable the
Fund to participate in these economies of scale. The Board considered economies
of scale to the extent applicable to the Fund's closed-end structure and
determined that the Fund appropriately benefits from any economies of scale and
no changes were currently necessary.

Conclusion

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, the entire
Board, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the
existing Investment Advisory Agreement, concluding that the advisory fee was
reasonable in relation to the services provided and that a contract renewal was
in the best interests of the shareholders.

MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level of
current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in

results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future

                  design or operation of internal control over financial
