NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

              Advantage  Advisers  Xanthus  Fund,  L.L.C.  (the  "Company")  was
              organized  as a  limited  liability  company  under  the  laws  of
              Delaware  in January  1999.  The Company is  registered  under the
              Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended,  (the  "Act") as a
              closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment company.  The
              Company's  term is  perpetual  unless  the  Company  is  otherwise
              terminated  under  the  terms  of the  Limited  Liability  Company
              Agreement  dated  as of June 5,  2003.  The  Company's  investment
              objective is to achieve maximum capital  appreciation.  It pursues
              this  objective by actively  investing  in a portfolio  consisting
              primarily of equity  securities  of  technology  companies  and of
              companies  which derive a major portion of their revenue  directly
              or  indirectly  from  technological   events  and  advances.   The
              Company's  portfolio  of  securities  in the  technology  area  is
              expected to include long and short  positions  primarily in equity
              securities  of U.S.  and  non-U.S.  companies.  Equity  securities
              include  common and preferred  stock and other  securities  having
              equity  characteristics,  including  convertible  debt securities,
              stock options, warrants and rights.

              Responsibility  for the overall  management and supervision of the
              operations of the Company is vested in the  individuals  who serve
              as the Board of  Managers of the  Company  ("Board of  Managers").
              There are five members of the Board of Managers and an  investment
              adviser.  The Company's  investment  adviser is Advantage Advisers
              Management,  L.L.C.,  a Delaware  limited  liability  company (the
              "Adviser").  The  Adviser is a  subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer  Asset
              Management Inc. ("OAM") and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
              ("Oppenheimer").  The  Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
              Company's investment activities pursuant to an investment advisory
              agreement  dated  June 5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member and
              controlling person of the Adviser. Subject to the oversight of the
              Adviser,  Mr. Takis  Sparaggis,  the  Managing  Director of Alkeon
              Capital Management, L.L.C. ("Alkeon"), serves as portfolio manager
              of the Company. Alkeon is admitted as a non-managing member of the
              Adviser.  Oppenheimer  is a  minority  joint  venture  partner  in
              Alkeon.

              The acceptance of additional contributions from Members is subject
              to approval by the Board of Managers.  Generally, after January 1,
              2004, new Members will not be accepted into the Company,  although
              existing  Members  as of  December  31,  2003 may make  additional
              contributions.  The  Company  may  from  time  to  time  offer  to
              repurchase interests pursuant to written tenders by Members.  Such
              repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be
              determined  by the  Board  of  Managers,  in  their  complete  and
              exclusive  discretion.  The Adviser expects that generally it will
              recommend  to the  Board of  Managers  that the  Company  offer to
              repurchase  interests  from Members twice each year,  effective at
              the end of the second  fiscal  quarter and again at the end of the
              year.

              Generally, except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall
              not be liable for the Company's debts, obligations and liabilities
              in any  amount in excess of the  capital  account  balance of such
              Member,  plus such  Member's  share of  undistributed  profits and
              assets.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

              The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in  conformity  with
              accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States
              requires the Adviser to make estimates and assumptions that affect
              the amounts reported in the financial  statements and accompanying
              notes.  The  Adviser  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in
              preparing the Company's  financial  statements  are reasonable and
              prudent;   however,   actual   results  could  differ  from  these
              estimates.

              A.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

              Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,
              are recorded on a trade-date  basis, and dividends are recorded on
              the  ex-dividend  date,  net  of  applicable   withholding  taxes.
              Interest  income and  expense are  recorded on the accrual  basis.
              Premiums and  discounts on fixed income  securities  are amortized
              using the effective interest rate method.

              B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

              The Company's  securities  are valued in accordance  with policies
              adopted by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

              Prior to April 2003,  domestic  exchange  traded or NASDAQ  listed
              equity  securities were valued at their last composite sale prices
              as reported on the exchanges where such securities are traded.  If
              no sales of such securities were reported on a particular day, the
              securities  were valued based upon their  composite bid prices for
              securities   held  long,  or  their  composite  asked  prices  for
              securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported by such exchanges.

              Pursuant to a resolution of the Company's Board of Managers passed
              on July 31, 2003,  the valuation  methodology  set forth below for
              domestic  exchange traded and NASDAQ  securities was put in effect
              reflecting the methodology made available by NASDAQ in April 2003.

              (i) Domestic  exchange traded  securities  (other than options and
                  those securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

                  (1)  at their last  composite  sale  prices as reported on the
                       exchanges where those securities are traded; or

                  (2)  If  no  sales  of  those  securities  are  reported  on a
                       particular  day,  the  securities  are valued  based upon
                       their  composite bid prices for securities  held long, or
                       their  composite  asked prices for securities held short,
                       as reported by those exchanges

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

              B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

              (ii)Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

                  (1)  at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is
                       the last trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern  Time)
                       adjusted  up to  NASDAQ's  best  offer  price if the last
                       traded price is below such bid and down to NASDAQ's  best
                       offer price if the last trade is above such offer price);
                       or

                  (2)  if no NOCP is  available,  at the last sale  price on the
                       NASDAQ prior to the calculation of the net asset value of
                       the Company; or

                  (3)  if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

                  (4)  if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the
                       price  will  be  deemed  "stale"  and the  value  will be
                       determined   in  accordance   with  the  fair   valuation
                       procedures set forth herein.

              Securities traded on a foreign securities  exchange will be valued
              at their last sale prices on the  exchange  where such  securities
              are  primarily  traded,  or in the absence of a reported sale on a
              particular  day,  at their bid prices  (in the case of  securities
              held long) or asked prices (in the case of  securities  sold,  not
              yet purchased) as reported by such  exchange.  Listed options will
              be  valued  at their bid  prices  (or asked  prices in the case of
              listed  options  sold,  not  yet  purchased)  as  reported  by the
              exchange  with the  highest  volume  on the  last day a trade  was
              reported. Other securities for which market quotations are readily
              available  will be valued at their bid prices (or asked  prices in
              the case of securities  sold,  not yet purchased) as obtained from
              one or more dealers making markets for those securities. If market
              quotations are not readily available,  securities and other assets
              will be valued at fair  value as  determined  in good faith by, or
              under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

              Debt  securities  will be valued in accordance with the procedures
              described above, which with respect to such securities may include
              the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs
              a matrix to  determine  valuation  for normal  institutional  size
              trading  units or  consultation  with  brokers and dealers in such
              securities.  The Board of Managers will  periodically  monitor the
              reasonableness of valuations provided by any such pricing service.
              Debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less will,
              absent unusual circumstances, be valued at amortized cost, so long
              as such  valuation  is  determined  by the  Board of  Managers  to
              represent fair value.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

              B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

              All  assets  and  liabilities   initially   expressed  in  foreign
              currencies  will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign
              exchange rates provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00
              p.m.  London  time.  Trading in foreign  securities  generally  is
              completed, and the values of such securities are determined, prior
              to the close of securities  markets in the U.S.  Foreign  exchange
              rates are also determined  prior to such close.  On occasion,  the
              values of such  securities  and exchange  rates may be affected by
              events  occurring  between the time such values or exchange  rates
              are  determined  and the  time  that  the net  asset  value of the
              Company is  determined.  When such  events  materially  affect the
              values of securities held by the Company or its liabilities,  such
              securities  and  liabilities  will  be  valued  at fair  value  as
              determined  in good  faith by, or under the  supervision  of,  the
              Board of Managers.

              C.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

              The Company treats all  highly-liquid  financial  instruments that
              mature  within  three  months  at the  time  of  purchase  as cash
              equivalents.

              D.  INCOME TAXES

              No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local  income
              taxes on the  profits of the  Company is made as the  Members  are
              individually  liable  for the income  taxes on their  share of the
              Company's income.

              The Company has reclassified  ($5,641,503)  and $125,272,652  from
              accumulated  net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain
              on investments,  respectively, to net capital contributions during
              the year ended  December 31,  2003.  This  reclassification  was a
              result of  permanent  book to tax  differences  to reflect,  as an
              adjustment  to net capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable
              income,  loss and net realized gain on investments  that have been
              allocated  to the  Company's  Members  and  had no  effect  on net
              assets.

     3.  ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

              Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative   services  to  the
              Company including,  among other things, providing office space and
              other support services. In exchange for such services, the Company
              pays Oppenheimer a monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on
              an annualized  basis) of the Company's net assets determined as of
              the beginning of the month.

     3.  ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

              During the six  months  ended June 30,  2004,  Oppenheimer  earned
              $62,166  as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio  transactions
              executed  on behalf of the  Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a
              broker-dealer  affiliate of Alkeon,  earned  $195,644 as brokerage
              commissions from portfolio  transactions executed on behalf of the
              Company.

              Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each fiscal  period
              are allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital
              accounts of all Members (but not the Special  Advisory  Member) as
              of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance  with Members'
              respective  investment  percentages  for the  fiscal  period.  The
              Adviser,  in its  capacity as the Special  Advisory  Member of the
              Company,  is  entitled  to receive an  incentive  allocation  (the
              "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged to the capital  account of each
              Member as of the last day of each allocation period, of 20% of the
              amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the positive  balance
              in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive  Allocation
              is credited to the Special Advisory Account of the Adviser. By the
              last  business  day of the  month  following  the date on which an
              Incentive  Allocation is made, the Adviser may withdraw up to 100%
              of the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited  to the  Special
              Advisory Account with respect to the allocation period. During the
              six months ended June 30, 2004, there was no Incentive Allocations
              allocated to the Special Advisory Member.

              Each member of the Board of Managers (a  "Manager")  who is not an
              "interested  person"  of the  Company,  as  defined  by  the  Act,
              receives an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each meeting
              attended.  Any  Manager  who is an  "interested  person"  does not
              receive any annual or other fee from the Company. All Managers are
              reimbursed  by  the  Company  for  all  reasonable   out-of-pocket
              expenses incurred by them in performing their duties.

              PFPC Trust  Company (the  "Custodian")  serves as custodian of the
              Company's assets.

              PFPC Inc. serves as investor  services and accounting agent to the
              Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
              recordkeeping, tax and investor related services. The Company pays
              PFPC an accounting  and investor  services fee based  primarily on
              the  average  net assets of the Company as of the last day of each
              month, payable monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

              Oppenheimer  acts as the  non-exclusive  placement  agent  for the
              Company,  without special compensation from the Company, and bears
              costs associated with its activities as placement agent.  However,
              the placement agent is entitled to charge a sales commission of up
              to 3% (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested)  in  connection  with a
              purchase of interests, at its discretion. For the six months ended
              June 30,  2004,  such  sales  commissions  earned  by  Oppenheimer
              amounted to $94,004.

     4.  INDEMNIFICATIONS
              The  Company has  entered  into  several  contracts  that  contain
              routine  indemnification  clauses.  The Company's maximum exposure
              under these arrangements is unknown,  as this would involve future
              claims  that may be made  against  the  Company  that have not yet
              occurred.  However,  based on experience,  the Company expects the
              risk of loss to be remote.

     5.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

              Aggregate purchases and sales of investment securities,  excluding
              short-term  securities,  for the six months  ended June 30,  2004,
              amounted to $735,988,518 and $663,840,390, respectively. Aggregate
              purchases  and  sales  of  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased,
              excluding short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
              2004, amounted to $99,511,520 and $203,953,657, respectively.

              At June 30,  2004,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income  tax
              purposes,  of portfolio  investments and securities  sold, not yet
              purchased is $511,036,039, and $153,294,340, respectively.

              For Federal income tax purposes, at June 30, 2004, accumulated net
              unrealized depreciation on investments was $31,636,995, consisting
              of $22,911,043 gross unrealized appreciation and $54,548,038 gross
              unrealized depreciation.

              Due from broker  primarily  represents  proceeds  from  securities
              sold, not yet purchased,  and excess cash held at the prime broker
              as of June 30, 2004.

     6.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

              The  Company  has the  ability  to trade on  margin  and,  in that
              connection,  borrow  funds from  brokers and banks for  investment
              purposes.  Trading  in equity  securities  on margin  involves  an
              initial  cash  requirement   representing  at  least  50%  of  the
              underlying  security's  value with respect to transactions in U.S.
              markets and varying  percentages  with respect to  transactions in
              foreign markets.  The Act requires the Company to satisfy an asset
              coverage  requirement  of  300%  of  its  indebtedness,  including
              amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the  Company  incurs the
              indebtedness.  The Company  pays  interest on  outstanding  margin
              borrowings at an annualized rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. The Company
              pledges securities as collateral for the margin borrowings,  which
              are maintained in a segregated account held by the Custodian.  For
              the six months  ended June 30, 2004,  the average  daily amount of
              such  borrowings was  $7,212,719  and the daily  weighted  average
              annualized interest rate was 0.01%.

     7.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

              In the normal  course of business,  the Company may trade  various
              financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
              with off-balance sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include
              options and securities sold, not yet purchased.  Generally,  these
              financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or
              sell other  financial  instruments  at specific terms at specified
              future dates. Each of these financial instruments contains varying
              degrees of  off-balance  sheet risk whereby  changes in the market
              value of the securities  underlying the financial  instruments may
              be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statement of assets,
              liabilities and members' capital.

              The Company  maintains  cash in bank deposit  accounts  which,  at
              times,  may exceed federally  insured limits.  The Company has not
              experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is
              exposed to any significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

              Securities  sold, not yet purchased  represent  obligations of the
              Company to deliver  specified  securities  and  thereby  creates a
              liability to purchase such  securities in the market at prevailing
              prices.  Accordingly,  these  transactions  result in  off-balance
              sheet risk as the  Company's  ultimate  obligation  to satisfy the
              sale of securities  sold,  not yet purchased may exceed the amount
              indicated  in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and members'
              capital.

              The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company
              pays  a  premium   whether  or  not  the   option  is   exercised.
              Additionally,  the  Company  bears the risk of loss of premium and
              change in market value should the  counterparty  not perform under
              the contract.  Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
              the same manner as investment securities.

              When the Company  writes an option,  the  premium  received by the
              Company is recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to
              the current market value of the option  written.  If a call option
              is  exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale
              of the underlying  security in determining whether the Company has
              realized a gain or loss.  In writing an option,  the Company bears
              the  market  risk of an  unfavorable  change  in the  price of the
              security or index  underlying the written  option.  Exercise of an
              option written by the Company could result in the Company  selling
              or buying a security at a price  different from the current market

         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for

         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) for
         the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  [Omitted]

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred   during  the
              registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
              fiscal  half-year  in the  case  of an  annual  report)  that  has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
