Item 1. Report to Shareholders

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this update, you'll learn about how your trust performed during the
       reporting period. The portfolio manager will provide an overview of the
       market climate, and discuss some of the factors that helped or hindered
       performance during the reporting period. In addition, this report
       includes the trust's financial statements and a list of investments, as
       well as other information.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. The trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and,
       therefore, the value of the trust shares may be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

       An investment in senior loans is subject to certain risks such as loan
       defaults and illiquidity due to insufficient collateral backing.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2003

       Howard Tiffen, Managing Director, is primarily responsible for the
       day-to-day management of Van Kampen Senior Income Trust. The following
       discussion reflects his views on the trust's performance.

Q.     BEFORE YOU DISCUSS HOW THE TRUST PERFORMED, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE
       OVERALL MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

A.     The market over the past year can really be divided into two distinct
       segments. During the first six months of the reporting period, a stagnant
       economy, lack of corporate earning power, and the effects of a series of
       corporate-governance scandals resulted in a very difficult environment
       for senior loans.

       During the latter half of the period, however, the market improved
       dramatically. Absolute levels of corporate profitability began to
       increase, the number of debt refinancings rose considerably, and default
       rates began to subside. As a result, bank loan prices rallied. We believe
       this marked improvement was the result of several factors. First,
       corporate management has been forced to learn how to better operate in a
       low-growth, low-inflation environment, which has led to stronger
       corporate valuations. Second, more companies have been able to issue
       long-term debt to shore up their balance sheets. And lastly, we began to
       see many companies that were in bankruptcy two to three years ago return
       to performing status and earn a profit.

Q.     HOW DID THE TRUST PERFORM DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.      --  For the year ended July 31, 2003, the trust produced a total return
            of 25.06 percent based on common share market price, and not
            reflective of any early withdrawal charges. If these charges were
            included, performance would be lower. Past performance is no
            guarantee of future results.

        --  The trust's monthly dividend of $.0348 translated to a distribution
            rate of 5.33 percent based on the trust's closing common share
            market price of $7.84 on July 31, 2003.

       See Performance Summary for additional information.

Q.     WHAT FACTORS HELPED PERFORMANCE?

A.      --  As mentioned earlier, declining default rates, improved corporate
            profitability and increased loan issuance, as well as an overall
            improving economy, all contributed to performance.

        --  A deeper secondary trading market in senior loans created greater
            opportunities for us to capture value. This, coupled with the

 2
<PAGE>

            appreciation of bank loan prices overall, helped boost the trust's
            return and net asset value.

        --  In addition, our team now includes a total of 24 analysts, who have
            an average of 16 years of industry experience. Given that we employ
            a bottom-up investment approach, we believe that such a large team
            has enabled us to conduct even more in-depth analysis of every
            investment candidate as well as all existing portfolio holdings, and
            is vital to our ongoing success.

Q.     WHAT HINDERED PERFORMANCE DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.      --  Early in the reporting period, flat corporate performance and a low
            level of issuance dampened trust returns and left us with few
            compelling new investment opportunities. However, we saw marked
            improvement here in the last several months.

        --  While we have seen default rates decline, they are still at
            higher-than-normal levels. The number of issuers in the portfolio
            that are in default (defined here as those not paying principal
            and/or interest as contractually obligated) has also declined, by
            approximately 9 percent since this same period last year.

        --  Because senior-loan coupon rates float with short-term market rates,
            the near-record low interest rates throughout the entire period also
            held the trust back.

Q.     PLEASE WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU POSITIONED THE TRUST, HIGHLIGHTING KEY
       THEMES.

A.     We employed a variety of strategies during the period:

        --  In an effort to build value and avoid losses in the portfolio, we
            made greater use of the secondary market, where we were able to
            purchase loans at or below their repayment or recovery values. In
            fact, we now have two analysts on our team who are largely dedicated
            to this market, conducting transactions daily.

        --  We continued to keep the portfolio highly diversified by issuer. As
            of July 31, the trust contained a total of 294 issuers. Typically,
            each of the trust's ten largest holdings represents less than two
            percent of total assets. We believe that a high level of
            diversification--not only in this environment but going forward as
            well--is instrumental to successful investing in the senior loan
            asset class.

        --  We strive to manage the trust as defensively as possible, and
            therefore, don't typically favor individual sectors. Some sectors
            may, however, fall out of favor from time to time. For example, we
            have chosen to reduce the trust's exposure to the auto and aerospace
            segments because we believe they are likely to deliver poor profits,
            and the value of collateral they can offer is also likely to fall.
            The trust's exposure to the health-care sector did increase slightly
            over the past year. We believe that certain parts of this sector
            have seen a significant improvement in business fundamentals, making
            some companies in the sector more attractive investments than they
            had previously been.

        --  We continued with our long-term strategy of focusing on companies
            that we believe demonstrate solid management strength--those that
            have learned to improve productivity in a low-inflation environment
            and keep their costs low.

Q.     NOW THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRUST, DO YOU HAVE ANY
       CLOSING THOUGHTS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS?

A.     We believe that the turnaround we've seen in the senior loan market as of
       late is based upon fundamentally-sound factors that may continue to
       positively influence the market. We also anticipate that default rates
       may continue their downward trend as the bankruptcies that occurred
       between 1999 and 2002 increasingly work their way through the system.

       While no one can predict with certainty where or when interest rates will
       bottom out, we believe it's likely that short-term rates may rise, or at
       least remain stable, over the next several months. Such an environment,
       coupled with more robust corporate performance, has historically been
       quite favorable for senior loans. Going forward, we will continue with
       our disciplined investment approach, monitoring the market closely for
       opportunities.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(e) Non-income producing security as this stock currently does not declare
    dividends.

(f) Restricted Security.

(g) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2003.

(i) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    commitments.

(j) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(k) Payment-in-kind security.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

**  Non-Annualized

(a) Net asset value on June 24, 1998 of $10.00 is adjusted for common share
    offering costs of $.013.

(b) Total return based on common share market price assumes an investment at the
    common share market price at the beginning of the period indicated,
    reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
    Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing
    common share market price at the end of the period indicated.

(c) Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
    variable rate senior loan interest.

(d) Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
    Borrowings) from the Trust's total assets and dividing by the total number
    of senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
    indebtedness.

(e) As required, effective August 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
    of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
    amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
    the year ended July 31, 2002 was to decrease the ratio of net investment
    income to average net asset applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
    investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses
    per share were unaffected by the adjustments. Per share, ratios and
    supplemental data for the periods prior to July 31, 2002 have not been
    restated to reflect this change in presentation.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of
current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to
achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of interests in
floating or variable rate senior loans to corporations, partnerships and other
entities which operate in a variety of industries and geographical regions. The
Trust borrows money for investment purposes which will create the opportunity
for enhanced return, but also should be considered a speculative technique and
may increase the Trust's volatility. The Trust commenced investment operations
on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. (the
"Adviser") by considering a number of factors including consideration of market
indicators, transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be
comparable (including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the

                                                                              31

security at a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Trust will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility
fees received are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan,
note, or other fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of
amendment fees which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as
compensation for agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2003, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $179,582,840, which will expire between July 31, 2009 and
2011.

    At July 31, 2003, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/ losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A permanent difference
related to book to tax amortization differences totaling $7,947,313 has been
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated
net realized loss.

    As of July 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                             <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................    $2,873,430
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions, other losses that were recognized for book purposes but not
tax purposes at the end of the fiscal year and post October losses which are not
realized for tax purposes until the first day of the following year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%

will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

NOTES TO

When the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Fund and the borrower.

    At July 31, 2003, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation
basis.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of
Van Kampen Senior Income Trust

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of July 31, 2003, the related statements of operations and cash
flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the
two years then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the four years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. The Trust's financial highlights for the periods ended prior to July 31,
2000 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated September 14, 1999,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of July 31, 2003, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust as of July 31, 2003, the results of its operations,
cash flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. Common Shareholders who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash paid by check mailed
directly to the Common Shareholder by the Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    State Street Bank and Trust Company, as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 90 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing State Street Bank and Trust Company. If you withdraw, you will receive,
without charge, a share certificate issued in your name for all full Common
Shares credited to your account under the Plan, and a cash payment will be made
for any fractional Common Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may
again elect to participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or
writing to the Trust at:

                              2800 Post Oak Blvd.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:
                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.       POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policies and
procedures for voting proxies with respect to securities held in the accounts of
clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary Investment
Management services and for which a MSIM entity has the authority to vote their
proxies. The policies and procedures and general guidelines in this section will
be reviewed and, as necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised
proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by these policies and procedures
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, L.P., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Investments LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each a "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will vote proxies as part of its authority to manage,
acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the MSIM registered
management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and Advisor
Funds)(collectively referred to as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM Fund will vote
proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the
case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management Agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or
its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a statement of proxy voting
policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's
policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations
or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their responsibility
for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process, Institutional
Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility Research Center
("IRRC") have been retained as

<PAGE>


experts in the proxy voting and corporate governance area. ISS and IRRC are
independent advisers that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level
proxy-related services to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors,
custodians, consultants, and other institutional investors. The services
provided to MSIM Affiliates include in-depth research, global issuer analysis,
and voting recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote
execution, reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see
Section IV.A. below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided
by the proxy research services.

Voting Proxies for certain Non-US Companies - While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States and other developed markets with a number
of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies
of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging
markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent a MSIM
Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are not
limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other
than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings;
(iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction
of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person,
(v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting
instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best
efforts basis only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been
retained to provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting
their clients' non-US proxies.

II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad range of issues, including board size and
composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover proposals, capital structure
proposals and social responsibility issues and are meant to be general voting
parameters on issues that arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however,
may vote in a manner that is contrary to the following general guidelines,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section IV. below, provided the vote is
consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

                   those proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
                   business which may come before the meeting."

2.            The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
              substantive financial or best interest impact on a shareholder,
              are generally voted in support of management, subject to the
              review and approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as
              appropriate.

              Capitalization changes

              -    Capitalization changes that eliminate other classes of stock
                   and voting rights.

              -    Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes
                   of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock)
                   if: (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated;
                   (ii) the number of shares requested is reasonable in relation
                   to the purpose for which authorization is requested; and
                   (iii) the authorization does not exceed 100% of shares

                   adjust proportionately to the authorized share amount will

                   for common stock increases.

              Compensation

                   amend the charters or bylaws.

                   not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii)
                   contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions
                   restricting the rights of shareholders.

              substantive financial or best interest impact on the shareholder,

              -    Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of
                   existing classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or
                   supervoting rights.

              -    Creation of "blank check" preferred stock.

                   shareholder vote to pass or repeal certain provisions.

4.            The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially

              Corporate Transactions

              -    Mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate
                   transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of assets,
                   reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations) will
                   be examined on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, ISS and
                   IRRC research and analysis will be used along with MSIM
                   Affiliates' research and analysis, based on, among other
                   things, MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.

              -    Change-in-control provisions in non-salary compensation
                   plans, employment contracts, and severance agreements that
                   benefit management and would be costly to shareholders if
                   triggered.

              -    Shareholders rights plans that allow appropriate offers to
                   shareholders to be blocked by the board or trigger provisions
                   that prevent legitimate offers from proceeding.

              -    Executive/Director stock option plans. Generally, stock
                   option plans should meet the following criteria:

                   (i)   Whether the stock option plan is incentive based;

                   (ii)  For mature companies, should be no more than 5% of the
                         issued capital at the time of approval;

                   (iii) For growth companies, should be no more than 10% of the
                         issued capital at the time of approval.

                   offers.

B.       SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

         1.   The following shareholder proposals are generally supported,

         1.   The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
              creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
              Procedures and, in this regard, has expressly adopted them.
              Following are some of the functions and responsibilities of the
              Committee.

              (a)  The Committee, which will consist of members designated by
                   MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for
                   establishing MSIM's proxy voting policies and guidelines and
                   determining how MSIM will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

              (b)  The Committee will periodically review and have the authority
                   to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting policies and
                   guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy Voting Policy and
                   Procedures) and establish and direct voting positions
                   consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

              (c)  The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
                   matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to
                   MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures; and (2) generally
                   review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM
                   portfolio

<PAGE>




                   companies in accordance with this Policy and Procedures
                   including, as appropriate, the voting results of prior
                   shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a similar
                   proposal was presented to shareholders. The Committee, or
                   its designee, will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy
                   Voting Policy and Procedures (and any amendments to them
                   and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may
                   adopt).

              (d)  The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
                   matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing
                   certain shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the
                   same proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM
                   portfolios to be voted differently than other shares) and/or
                   "override voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in
                   a manner contrary to the Procedures); (2) review and approve
                   upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters for which
                   specific direction has been provided in Sections I, II, and
                   III above; and (3) determine how to vote matters for which
                   specific direction has not been provided in Sections I, II
                   and III above. Split votes will generally not be approved
                   within a single Global Investor Group team. The Committee may
                   take into account ISS recommendations and the research
                   provided by IRRC as well as any other relevant information
                   they may request or receive.

              (e)  In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                   Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                   material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                   appearance of a potential material conflict of interest, the
                   Committee will designate a special committee to review, and
                   recommend a course of action with respect to, the conflict(s)
                   in question ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may
                   request the assistance of the Law and Compliance Departments
                   and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to
                   the research provided by ISS and IRRC, the Special Committee
                   may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment
                   professionals and outside sources to the extent it deems
                   appropriate.

              (f)  The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                   designee(s), will document in writing all of their decisions
                   and actions, which documentation will be maintained by the
                   Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s) for
                   a period of at least 6 years. To the extent these decisions
                   relate to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                   investment company, the Committee and Special Committee, or
                   their designee(s), will report their decisions to each
                   applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those investment
                   companies at each Board's next regularly Scheduled Board
                   meeting. The report will contain information concerning
                   decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during
                   the most

<PAGE>




                   recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding the
                   Board meeting.

              (g)  The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                   will timely communicate to applicable PMs, the Compliance
                   Departments and, as necessary to ISS, decisions of the
                   Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
                   ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                              ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         -        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         -        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         -        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         -        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions
in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities
<PAGE>

or other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons"
(as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund. The Fund's and its
investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent,
or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and
is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such
conflicts fall outside the parameters of this Code, unless or until the General
Counsel determines that any violation of such programs and procedures is also a
violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
              influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
              whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
              indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund;

         -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
              individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
              benefit of the Fund; or

         -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
              or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund
              to trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
              contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.



<PAGE>



         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
              board of any public or private company;

         -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
              gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or
              entity with which the Fund has current or prospective business
              dealings, not including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or
              sporting events or other similar entertainment; provided it is
              business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
              place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
              impropriety;

         -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
              relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
              its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated
              person thereof; and

         -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
              transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
              portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
              than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment,
              such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
              disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
              Funds;

         -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
              others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
              within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
              Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators and
              self-regulatory organizations;

         -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
              area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
              of the Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of
              promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
              disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or
              submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the
              Funds; and

         -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
              compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
              applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY



<PAGE>

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming
              a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
              received, read and understands the Code;

         -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with
              the requirements of the Code;

         -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or
              any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports
              of potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of
              any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
              of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(1) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
              investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
              violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to
              take any further action;

         -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will
              be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
              "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
              "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
              relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will
              consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
              appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
              notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or
              its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or
              other appropriate disciplinary actions;

         -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of
              the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this
              Code, as appropriate; and

- --------
1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."


<PAGE>



         -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
              required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B

or C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each
Fund, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.



<PAGE>



VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

     Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net

     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
     information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
     procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
     report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

c)   presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
     disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of the
     Evaluation Date;

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
     controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
     registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
