LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[Photo of Jeffrey L. Shames]
      Jeffrey L. Shames

Dear Shareholders,
Our firm was built on the philosophy that bottom- up fundamental research is the
best means of achieving superior long term investment performance. When you're
managing billions of dollars for investors, we think you have an obligation to
have in-depth, firsthand knowledge of every company you own whether it is in the
U.S. or anywhere across the globe.

We have structured our equity and fixed-income investment teams to capitalize on
the strength of our investment process and the global reach of our analysts
based around the world. Our global research team is composed of 45 equity
analysts, 27 based in the U.S. and 18 based abroad, and 26 credit research
analysts. Each analyst is assigned one or more specific industries and then
charged with identifying the most attractive investment ideas within these
industries. Our U.S. and non-U.S. equity research analysts are unified into one
team that emphasizes a collaborative process in analyzing securities across the
globe. Credit analysts also share their expertise in each segment of the
fixed-income market and work as part of the same team ensuring that every member
has access to information that may have a material effect on their investment
decisions. As MFS continues to grow and as markets become more complex, we
believe our structure will enable us to maintain a consistent investment process
with the goal of providing strong, long-term investment performance across
market capitalizations, investment disciplines, and country borders for our fund
shareholders.

THINKING GLOBALLY
More companies than ever compete globally and, therefore, we must make
investment decisions knowing what is occurring outside of a company's local
market. This trend plays to the strength of our environment of collaboration
between our analysts and portfolio managers across the globe. The analysts know
the most details about individual companies in specific industries and
geographic regions. The portfolio managers have broader, cross-industry insights
and a wider perspective on companies and industries. Our goal is to make sure
those two sets of perspectives coordinate and work well together. As markets
across the globe become more interdependent, we believe our collaborative
environment allows us to produce solid investment ideas for our portfolios.

BUILDING A NETWORK
Simply put, we believe our structure assures that our analysts maintain their
peripheral vision rather than becoming too immersed in a specific segment of the
market. We do not believe that analysts and portfolio managers -- no matter how
talented they may be -- can succeed by working in a vacuum. Through the latest
technology available, our entire research team meets frequently via video and
telephone teleconferences, email, and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants). When
we hire new analysts, we require them to spend an average of one year in Boston
to learn MFS' culture and to build relationships with their peers. We believe
the interaction among our analysts is the key to making our collaborative
process work towards delivering superior long term investment performance for
our fund shareholders. Our analysts work out of four research offices in Boston,
London, Singapore, and Tokyo, and are assigned to specific regions and
industries. They meet regularly with their colleagues to discuss the trends
around the world affecting the companies they cover.

In addition, our equity and fixed-income analysts often visit company
managements as a team. This collaboration is vital because of the different
perspective they bring to their analysis. Because a company's stock price has
tended to follow its earnings over time, our equity research analysts tend to
focus on gauging earnings potential, a company's position within its industry
and its ability to grow its market share. Conversely, our fixed income analysts
will look at stability of a company's cash flow, the value of its assets, and
its capital structure to gauge whether the company can generate enough free cash
flow to pay off its debt. As a result of their collaboration, we believe we're
able to see a more complete view of a company.

WORKING TOGETHER
Our portfolio managers also work closely with the analysts to select the most
appropriate securities for their portfolios from the various recommendations
made by the analysts. Opinions are exchanged and ideas are challenged so that
each member of our team is involved in our investment process. In fact, our
portfolio managers will be the first ones to tell you that many of their best
ideas start with the research analysts. We believe our collaborative approach
also provides us with an effective way to assess risk. Our portfolio managers
are not discouraged from taking on an appropriate level of risk; however we have
rigorous guidelines to assure that the level of risk is measured and monitored
and consistent with the investment philosophies of each of our portfolios. All
told, we believe our culture empowers the members of our investment team to
continue to do their best work and allows them to make better investment
decisions.

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or
comments you may have.

Respectfully,

/s/ Jeffrey L. Shames

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

Dear Shareholders,
For the 6 months ended April 30, 2003, the trust provided a total return of
9.16% based on its beginning and ending stock market prices and assuming the
reinvestment of any dividends and capital gains distributions paid during the
period. The trust's total return based on its net asset value (NAV) was 2.68%.
This return compares to those of 3.59% and 2.95%, respectively, for the trust's
benchmarks, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the Lehman Index), a broad
measure of the municipal bond market, and the Lipper Closed End High Yield
Municipal Index (the Lipper Index), an index composed of 10 closed-end funds
(including MFS(R) Municipal Income Trust) that invest at least 50% of their
assets in lower-rated municipal debt securities.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT
The municipal bond market overall posted gains during the six months ended April
30, 2003, as economic growth was moderate and uncertainty about the economy
pushed interest rates down. While high-yield municipal bonds delivered positive
returns, they did not perform as well as higher-rated issues. Early in the
period, we saw a continuation of the "flight to quality" that had begun in the
spring and summer of 2002. A rash of corporate scandals, economic weakness, and
then the expectation of war with Iraq led investors to seek high-quality assets
such as Treasuries and "AAA"-rated municipal bonds, which typically have been
less volatile than lower-rated bonds in times of crisis. (Principal and interest
of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government if held to
maturity.)

A factor that held back higher-yielding municipal issues was the problem of
budget shortfalls at the state and local level, as the slowing economy hurt tax
receipts. While the issues of corporate misdeeds and Iraqi war worries seemed to
have largely faded by the end of April -- and in fact we saw a rally in stocks
and taxable high-yield bonds during this time -- municipal budget problems
continued to lead muni investors to prefer less risky, higher-quality bonds.

The high-yield municipal area also suffered from specific sector woes. Bonds of
health care facilities, which are partly dependent on state Medicaid and federal
Medicare payments, were affected by government budget tightening. Airline and
airport-related bonds were pressured by financial stress at most major carriers.

One of the hardest-hit areas was tobacco bonds. These securities are backed by
the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), in which tobacco companies agreed to
a stream of payments to 46 states in return for the states dropping
smoking-related class action lawsuits. In March, a different lawsuit raised
questions about Philip Morris USA's ability to make its April 2003 MSA payment,
and state tobacco bonds declined on the news. While Philip Morris did make its
April payment, tobacco bonds remained somewhat depressed by the perception of
increased risk in the sector.

PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE LIPPER INDEX
The trust modestly underperformed (based upon total return on NAV) against the
Lipper Closed End High Yield Municipal Index, a benchmark composed of the
trust's peers. There were two main reasons for that underperformance. Relative
to its peers, the trust was overweighted in tobacco bonds, which declined in
price. In addition, the trust was relatively short in duration (a measure of
sensitivity to interest rate changes). For that reason, the trust benefited less
than its peer group when interest rates declined (and bond prices rose) over the
period.

In contrast, the trust's overweighting in the utilities sector helped relative
performance. In mid-2002, the sector in general had been depressed by fallout
from the Enron scandal. By the start of the six-month period, however, the
situation began to turn around. Utilities started to improve their balance
sheets, and banks restructured utility loans with longer maturities. Investors
seemed to realize that most utilities were not going to go bankrupt and that
perhaps those securities had become undervalued. The result was strong
performance in the sector over the period.

Another positive factor was the trust's positioning on the yield curve. (A yield
curve for bonds is a graph showing yield against time remaining to maturity. In
most cases, yield increases with maturity.) Over the period, interest rates in
the 12- to 20-year part of the curve declined more than longer-term rates, so
bonds in the 12- to 20-year area saw more price appreciation. The trust's
overweighting in that better-performing part of the curve helped relative
performance.

PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE LEHMAN INDEX
The trust underperformed (based upon total return on NAV) against the Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index, a benchmark composed primarily of high-grade
securities rated "A" or better. As mentioned earlier, high-yield securities,
which are the trust's main focus, underperformed high-grade issues over the
period. This was the main factor in the trust's underperformance relative to the
Lehman Index. (By prospectus, the trust must, under normal market conditions,
have at least 65% of its holdings in bonds rated "BBB" or lower.)

Respectfully,

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

All results are historical. Investment return and principal value will
fluctuate, and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original
cost. More recent returns may be more or less than those shown. Past performance
is no guarantee of future results.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The portfolio focuses on companies in a limited number of sectors making it more
susceptible to adverse economic, political, or regulatory developments affecting
those sectors than a portfolio that invests more broadly.

Investments in lower-rated securities may provide greater returns but may have
greater-than-average risk.

Because the portfolio invests in a limited number of companies a change in one
security's value may have a more significant effect on the portfolio's value.

Government guarantees apply to the underlying securities only and not to the
prices and yields of the portfolio.

These risks may increase share price volatility. Please see the prospectus for
further information on these and other risk considerations.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

MFS offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you to
reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the long-
term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that price
exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the shares
are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price of either
the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater. Twice each
year you can also buy shares. Investments in any amount over $100 can be made in
January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are bought
on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each participant
pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic reinvestment of
distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in one of two ways:
a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a certificate for
the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

 (S)As required, effective November 1, 2001, the trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting market discount on
    debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended October 31, 2002 was to
    increase net investment income per share by $0.01, decrease net realized and unrealized
    gains and losses per share by $0.01, and to increase the ratio of net investment income to
    average net assets by 0.07%. Per share, ratios, and supplemental data for periods prior to
    November 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

(1) Business and Organization
MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a Massachusetts business
trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as
a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.

(2) Significant Accounting Policies
General - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The trust can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield
securities rated below investment grade. Investments in high- yield securities
involve greater degrees of credit and market risk than investments in
higher-rated securities and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions.

Investment Valuations - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) of U.S. issuers in the trust's portfolio are valued at
an evaluated bid price on the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers or on the
basis of valuations furnished by a pricing service. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Short-term obligations in the trust's
portfolio are valued at amortized cost, which constitutes fair value as
determined by the Board of Trustees. Short-term obligations with a remaining
maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon dealer supplied valuations.
Portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or
whose values have been materially affected by events occurring after the close
of their primary markets, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith
by or at the direction of the Board of Trustees.

Futures Contracts - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities, or contracts based on financial indices at a fixed price
on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is required to deposit
with the broker either in cash or securities an amount equal to a certain
percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are made or received by
the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the
contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains
or losses by the trust. The trust's investment in futures contracts is designed
to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest rates or securities
prices. Investments in interest rate futures for purposes other than hedging may
be made to modify the duration of the portfolio without incurring the additional
transaction costs involved in buying and selling the underlying securities.
Should interest rates or securities prices move unexpectedly, the trust may not
achieve the anticipated benefits of the futures contracts and may realize a
loss.

Swap Agreements - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party, which is based on
a specific financial index. Cash payments are exchanged at specified intervals
and the expected income or expense is recorded on the accrual basis. The value
of the swap is adjusted daily and the change in value is recorded as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation. Risks may arise upon entering into these
agreements from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contract and from unanticipated changes in the value of the financial
index on which the swap agreement is based. The trust uses swaps for both
hedging and non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may use swaps
to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For non-hedging purposes,
the trust may use swaps to take a position on anticipated changes in the
underlying financial index.

Rate Lock Swaps - The trust may enter into rate lock swaps, which are used to
reduce the interest rate risk of the portfolio. A rate lock swap is a payment or
receipt of cash on a specified future date, calculated as the difference between
the strike rate and a specific index yield on that date. The payment received or
made at the end of the measurement period is recorded as a realized gain or loss
in the Statement of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted daily and the
change in value is recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

Investment Transactions and Income - Investment transactions are recorded on the
trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium and
discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and original issue
discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by
federal income tax regulations. Some securities may be purchased on a
"when-issued" or "forward delivery" basis, which means that the securities will
be delivered to the trust at a future date, usually beyond customary settlement
time.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the value
of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal fees are
expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer, which are
generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of high-yield
debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the security.
Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of capital
infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization are
reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance an
investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

Fees Paid Indirectly - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount is shown as a reduction of total expenses on the Statement of
Operations.

Tax Matters and Distributions - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net tax-
exempt and taxable net income, including any net realized gain on investments.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.
Distributions paid by the trust from net interest received on tax-exempt
municipal bonds are not includable by shareholders as gross income for federal
income tax purposes because the trust intends to meet certain requirements of
the Code applicable to regulated investment companies, which will enable the
trust to pay exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any,
earned on private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986 may be considered a
tax-preference item to shareholders.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the financial
statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for defaulted bonds, capital losses, and amortization and accretion
on debt securities.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended October 31, 2002
and October 31, 2001 was as follows:

                                           OCTOBER 31, 2002   OCTOBER 31, 2001

As of October 31, 2002, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

      Undistributed ordinary income               $    41,436
      Undistributed long-term tax-exempt income     5,432,968

      Other temporary differences                    (985,698)

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration.

(3) Transactions with Affiliates
Investment Adviser - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the trust's average daily net assets and 6.32% of investment income.

The trust pays compensation to the Independent Trustees ("Trustees") in the form
of both a retainer and attendance fees, and pays no compensation directly to its
Trustees who are officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the
trust, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the trust from
MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS
and MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). On January 1, 2002, the Trustees terminated
the Independent Trustee unfunded defined benefit plan for active Trustees.
Included in the Trustees' compensation is a pension expense of $7,129 for
inactive trustees for the six months ended April 30, 2003.

Administrator - The trust has an administrative services agreement with MFS to
provide the trust with certain financial, legal, shareholder communications,
compliance, and other administrative services. As a partial reimbursement for
the cost of providing these services, the trust pays MFS an administrative fee
at the following annual percentages of the trust's average daily net assets:

              First $2 billion                          0.0175%
              Next $2.5 billion                         0.0130%

              In excess of $7 billion                   0.0000%

Transfer Agent - MFSC acts as registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the
trust. The agreement provides that the trust will pay MFSC an account
maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per
reinvestment and will reimburse MFSC for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

(4) Portfolio Securities

(6) Line of Credit
The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the bank's
base rate. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily unused
portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the participating funds at the
end of each quarter. The commitment fee allocated to the trust for the six
months ended April 30, 2003 was $1,015. The trust had no borrowings during the
period.

(7) Financial Instruments
The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal
course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to market risks
such as interest rates. These financial instruments include swap agreements. The
notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment
the trust has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement
of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all
related and offsetting transactions are considered.

(9) Auction Preferred Shares
The trust issued 2,800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS), series T and
2,800 of Auction Preferred Shares (APS), series TH. Dividends are cumulative at
a rate that is reset every seven days for both series through an auction
process. During the six months ended April 30, 2003, the dividend rates ranged
from 1.56% to 1.18%. The trust pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the
preferred share liquidation value for remarketing efforts associated with the
preferred auction. The APS are redeemable at the option of the trust in whole or
in part at the redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption if certain
requirements relating to its asset maintenance coverage are not satisfied. The
trust is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as
defined in the trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

In accordance with EITF D-98, "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable
Securities", effective for the current period, the trust has reclassified its
APS from outside of permanent equity in the Net Assets section of the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, distributions to APS shareholders are
now classified as a component of the "Increase in net assets from operations" on
the Statement of Operations and Statement of Changes in Net Assets and as a
component of the "Total from Investment Operations" in the Financial Highlights.
Prior year amounts presented have been reclassified to confirm this period's
presentation. This change has no impact of the net assets applicable to common
shares of the trust.

(10) Change in Accounting Principle
As required, effective November 1, 2001, the trust adopted the provisions of the
AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
market discount on debt securities. Prior to November 1, 2001, the trust did not
accrete market discount on debt securities. The cumulative effect of this
accounting change had no impact on total net assets of the trust, but resulted
in a $523,371 increase in cost of securities and a corresponding $523,371
increase in net unrealized depreciation, based on securities held by the trust
on November 1, 2001.

The effect of this change for the year ended October 31, 2002 was to increase
net investment income by $203,659, increase net unrealized depreciation by
$192,610, and increase net realized losses by $11,049. The Statement of Changes
in Net Assets and Financial Highlights for prior periods has not been restated
to reflect this change in presentation.

The Trust holds annual shareholder meetings for the purpose of electing Trustees, and Trustees are elected for
fixed terms. The Board of Trustees currently is divided into three classes, each having a term of three years.
Each year the term of one class expires. Each Trustee's term of office expires on the date of the third annual
meeting following the election to office of the Trustee's class. Each Trustee will serve until next elected or

Messrs. Shames, Ives, Perera and Poorvu, and Ms. Smith, have served in their capacity as Trustee of the Trust
