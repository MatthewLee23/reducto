                          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Directors of
     UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.

We have audited the  accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members' capital of UBS Technology
Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund"),  including the schedule of portfolio investments,  as of December 31, 2010,
and the related  statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes
in members'  capital for each of the two years in the period then ended,  and the financial  highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended.  These financial  statements and financial  highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  We were
not  engaged to perform  an audit of the Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our audits
included  consideration  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.  An audit also  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and the
disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights,  assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of  investments  in  investment  funds as of December 31, 2010, by
correspondence  with  management of the underlying  investment  funds. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. at December 31, 2010, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members'  capital
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years
in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


                                                                                       (ERNST & YOUNG LOGO)

1.  ORGANIZATION

    UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a limited partnership under the
    laws of Delaware on December  28,  1998,  commenced  operations  on April 1, 1999 and was  subsequently
    reorganized as a limited liability company effective October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the
    Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  (the "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,
    management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to maximize capital appreciation over
    the long-term.  The Fund pursues its  investment  objective by deploying its assets  primarily  among a
    select group of portfolio  managers who invest primarily in, or who have particular  knowledge  within,
    the technology sector.  Generally,  such portfolio  managers conduct their investment  programs through
    unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,  the "Investment  Funds") in which the Fund invests as a
    limited partner or member along with other investors.

    The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors")  have overall  responsibility to manage and control the
    business affairs of the Fund,  including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies
    regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.

    As of September 30, 2010,  pursuant to an  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement,  the Directors  have
    engaged UBS Alternative and  Quantitative  Investments LLC ("UBS A&Q", the "Manager" and when providing
    services  under the  Administration  Agreement,  the  "Administrator"),  a Delaware  limited  liability
    company, to provide investment advice regarding the selection of Investment Funds and to be responsible
    for the  day-to-day  management  of the Fund.  UBS A&Q is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG and is
    registered as an investment adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In addition
    to the assignment of  responsibilities,  the capital  balance as of September 30, 2010 was  transferred
    from UBSFA (defined below) to UBS A&Q.

    Prior to the Assignment and Assumption  Agreement,  the Directors had engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.
    ("UBSFA"), a Delaware limited liability company, in the roles of Manager and Administrator.  UBSFA is a
    wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,  which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS AG and is
    registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

    Initial and additional  applications for interests by eligible  investors may be accepted at such times
    as the Directors may determine and are generally  accepted monthly.  The Directors reserve the right to
    reject any application for interests in the Fund.

    The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to written  tenders to members
    (the "Members"). These repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by
    the Directors, in their complete and exclusive discretion.  The Manager expects that generally, it will
    recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from


                                                                                                          7

1.  ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

    Members  twice each year,  near  mid-year  and  year-end.  Members can only  transfer  or assign  their
    membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,  bankruptcy,
    insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with the written approval of the Directors, which may be
    withheld in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Such transfers may be made even if the balance of the
    capital  account  to such  transferee  is  equal  to or less  than  the  transferor's  initial  capital
    contribution.

2.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In January 2010, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued  Codification  Accounting
    Standards Update No. 2010-06,  IMPROVING DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ("ASU 2010-06"). ASU
    2010-06  amends  Topic  820,  FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS  AND  DISCLOSURES  to add new  requirements  for
    disclosures  about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, and separate  disclosures about purchases,
    sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. This update also clarifies existing
    fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation  for the classes of assets and liabilities and
    the disclosures  about the inputs and valuation  techniques used to measure fair value.  ASU 2010-06 is
    effective  for the  interim  and annual  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2009 and for periods
    beginning  after  December  15, 2010 for the new Level 3  disclosures.  The adoption of ASU 2010-06 new
    disclosures  and  clarification  of existing  disclosures  did not have a material impact on the Fund's
    financial statements.

3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

    The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
    principles  ("GAAP"),  which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

    Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's investments which are summarized in
    the three broad levels listed below.

    LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
    LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments  in Investment  Funds with the ability to redeem at net asset value
    as of the measurement date, or within one year of the measurement date
    LEVEL 3-- fair value of investments  in Investment  Funds that do not have the ability to redeem at net
    asset value within one year of the measurement date


                                                                                                          8

                                                                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

    A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

    The Fund  recognizes  transfers into and out of the levels  indicated above at the end of the reporting
    period.  All transfers into and out of Level 3 can be found in the Level 3 reconciliation  table within
    the Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

    GAAP provides guidance in determining  whether there has been a significant  decrease in the volume and
    level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for such asset or
    liability (or similar assets or liabilities).  GAAP also provides guidance on identifying circumstances
    that  indicate  a  transaction  with  regards  to such an asset or  liability  is not  orderly.  In its
    consideration, the Fund must consider inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and
    liabilities.  Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which
    disclosures about fair value  measurements are provided.  Fair value  measurement  disclosures for each
    class of assets and  liabilities  requires  greater  disaggregation  than the Fund's  line items in the
    Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Members' Capital. The Fund determines the appropriate classes for
    those  disclosures  on the  basis of the  nature  and risks of the  assets  and  liabilities  and their
    classification in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Levels 1, 2, and 3).

    For assets and  liabilities  measured at fair value on a recurring  basis  during the period,  the Fund
    provides quantitative disclosures about the fair value measurements separately for each class of assets
    and  liabilities,  as well as a  reconciliation  of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and
    liabilities broken down by class.

    The following is a summary of the investment strategy and any restrictions on the liquidity  provisions
    of the investments in Investment Funds held in the Fund as of December 31, 2010.  Investment Funds with
    no current  redemption  restrictions  may be  subject  to future  gates,  lock-up  provisions  or other
    restrictions, in accordance with their offering documents. The Fund had no unfunded capital commitments
    as of December 31, 2010.

    The Investment Funds in the long/short  equity strategy invest in both long and short equity strategies
    are primarily in common stocks focused in the  technology  sector.  The management of these  Investment
    Funds has the  ability  to shift  investments  from  value to growth  strategies,  from  small to large
    capitalization  common stocks,  and from a net long position to a net short position.  Investment Funds
    within this strategy are generally  subject to a 30 - 90 day redemption  notice period.  The Investment
    Funds within this strategy have either initial  redemption  dates commencing in the future (13 percent)
    or are available to be redeemed with no  restrictions  (87 percent),  subject to the Investment  Funds'
    liquidity terms, as of the measurement date.


                                                                                                          9

    A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

    A detailed  depiction  of each  investment  in the  portfolio by  investment  strategy,  including  any
    additional  liquidity  terms and other  restrictions,  as well as a breakdown of the portfolio into the
    fair value measurement levels, can be found in the tables within the Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

    Net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the Manager as of the close of
    business at the end of any fiscal period in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or
    as may be determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established by the Directors.  The Fund's
    investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and  conditions of the  respective  operating
    agreements and offering  memorandums,  as appropriate.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are
    carried at fair value. All valuations  utilize financial  information  supplied by each Investment Fund
    and are net of management  and  performance  incentive  fees or  allocations  payable to the Investment
    Funds'  managers or pursuant to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures
    require the Manager to consider  all  relevant  information  available  at the time the Fund values its
    portfolio.  The Manager has assessed factors  including,  but not limited to the individual  Investment
    Funds' compliance with fair value measurements,  price transparency and valuation  procedures in place,
    and  subscription  and  redemption  activity.  The Manager  and/or the  Directors  will  consider  such
    information and consider whether it is appropriate,  in light of all relevant  circumstances,  to value
    such a position at its net asset value as  reported  or whether to adjust  such value.  The  underlying
    investments  of each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in each  Investment
    Fund's financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

    The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these Investment Funds, for which there is
    no ready market,  has been estimated by the respective  Investment  Funds' management and is based upon
    available  information  in the absence of readily  ascertainable  fair values and does not  necessarily
    represent  amounts that might  ultimately be realized.  Due to the inherent  uncertainty  of valuation,
    those  estimated fair values may differ  significantly  from the values that would have been used had a
    ready market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

    It is unknown on an aggregate  basis  whether the  Investment  Funds held any  investments  whereby the
    Fund's proportionate share exceeded 5% of the Fund's net assets at December 31, 2010.

    The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments approximates
    the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.


                                                                                                         10

    B.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

    The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund transactions based on the pro-rata
    ratio of the fair  value and cost of the  underlying  investment  at the date of  redemption.  Interest
    income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

    C.  FUND EXPENSES

    The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not limited to, the following: all
    costs and expenses related to portfolio  transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees;
    accounting and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;  costs of
    insurance;  registration expenses; offering and organization costs; due diligence, including travel and
    related  expenses;  expenses of meetings of  Directors;  all costs with  respect to  communications  to
    Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

    D.  INCOME TAXES

    The Fund  has  reclassified  $3,073,848  and  $11,642,167  from  accumulated  net  investment  loss and
    accumulated  net realized gain from  investments  in  Investment  Funds,  respectively,  to net capital
    contributions  during the year ended  December 31, 2010.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an
    adjustment  to net  contributions,  the  amount  of  estimated  taxable  income  or loss that have been
    allocated to the Fund's Members as of December 31, 2010 and had no effect on members' capital.

    The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S. federal  jurisdiction and applicable  states.  Management
    has  analyzed the Fund's tax  positions  taken on its federal and state income tax returns for all open
    tax years,  and has  concluded  that no  provision  for federal or state  income tax is required in the
    Fund's  financial  statements.  The Fund's federal and state income tax returns for tax years for which
    the  applicable  statutes of  limitations  have not expired are subject to  examination by the Internal
    Revenue Service and state departments of revenue.  The Fund recognizes interest and penalties,  if any,
    related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

    Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its  distributive  share of the
    Fund's taxable income or loss.

    E.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PFPC Trust Company account which pays money
    market rates and are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest which is included in interest


                                                                                                         11

    E.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (CONTINUED)

    receivable on the  Statement of Assets,  Liabilities  and Members'  Capital.  Such cash, at times,  may
    exceed federally insured limits.  The Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not
    believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.

    F.  USE OF ESTIMATES

    The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with GAAP requires  management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported  amounts of increases
    and decreases in members'  capital from operations  during the reporting  period.  Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    UBS A&Q provides certain management and  administrative  services to the Fund,  including,  among other
    things, providing office space and other support services. In consideration for such services, the Fund
    pays UBS A&Q a monthly  management  fee (the  "Management  Fee") at an annual  rate of 1% of the Fund's
    members' capital, excluding the capital account attributable to the Manager. The Management Fee is paid
    to UBS A&Q out of the Fund's assets and debited against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the
    Manager's capital account. A portion of the Management Fee is paid by UBS A&Q to its affiliates.

    UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a
    placement  agent for the Fund,  without  special  compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs
    associated with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any, charged on contributions are
    debited against the contribution  amounts,  to arrive at a net subscription  amount.  The placement fee
    does not constitute assets of the Fund.

    The net  increase or  decrease in members'  capital  derived  from  operations  (net income or loss) is
    initially  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all  Members  on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the
    Management Fee which is similarly  allocated to all Members other than the Manager as described  above.
    In accordance with the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement,  the Manager is then allocated an amount
    based on the performance of the Fund (the "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement  Period, as defined
    in the Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of a Member to the Fund,
    and  thereafter  each period  commencing on the day following  the last  Measurement  Period and ending
    generally  on the first to occur of (1) a fiscal  year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption).  The
    Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.


                                                                                                         12

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

    The Performance  Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's  capital account at the end of the
    Measurement Period,  provided that appreciation in the Member's capital account (net of any Performance
    Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold  return.  The threshold return is the amount that a Member would
    have earned for a fiscal year if it had  received  an  annualized  rate of return of 20% on its opening
    capital account balance,  as adjusted.  No Performance Bonus was earned for the year ended December 31,
    2010 or for the year ended December 31, 2009.

    Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee for each meeting  attended.
    The  Chairman  of the  Board of  Directors  and the  Chairman  of the Audit  Committee  of the Board of
    Directors  each  receive  an  additional  annual  retainer  in the  amounts  of  $10,000  and  $15,000,
    respectively.  These  additional  annual retainer  amounts are paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis
    with ten other UBS funds where UBS A&Q is the investment  adviser.  All Directors are reimbursed by the
    Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.

    Other investment  partnerships sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates may also maintain investment
    interests in the Investment Funds owned by the Fund.

5.  ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES

    PFPC Trust  Company (the  "Custodian"),  which will be renamed BNY Mellon  Investment  Servicing  Trust
    Company effective July 1, 2011,  provides custodial services for the Fund. The Custodian entered into a
    service agreement whereby PFPC Trust provides securities clearance functions, as needed.

    On July 1, 2010,  the PNC  Financial  Services  Group,  Inc. sold the  outstanding  stock of PNC Global
    Investment  Servicing Inc. to the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.  At the closing of the sale, PNC
    Global Investment  Servicing (U.S.), Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.
    ("BNY  Mellon").  BNY Mellon serves as accounting and investor  servicing agent to the Fund and in that
    capacity provides certain administrative,  accounting, record keeping, tax and Member related services.
    BNY Mellon  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the average  members'  capital of the Fund
    subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii) the aggregate members' capital of the Fund and certain other
    investment funds sponsored or advised by UBS AG, UBS Americas, Inc. or their affiliates.  Additionally,
    the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by BNY Mellon.

    Effective March 26, 2010, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to a fee reduction for reimbursement
    of the Fund's line of credit  commitment fees ("Fee  Reduction") for a period of 364 days from November
    1, 2010,  the effective  date of the Fund's line of credit  agreement  with State Street Bank and Trust
    Company ("Initial Term"). Based on the methodology within the agreement,

5.  ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES (CONTINUED)

    the Custodian  and BNY Mellon have agreed to waive $34,800 for the Fund over the Initial Term.  For the
    period from  November,  1, 2010 to December 31, 2010,  the  Custodian  and BNY Mellon waived $1,200 and
    $5,800,  respectively,  which is shown in  aggregate as  administration  and custody fees waived on the
    Statement of Operations.

6.  LOAN PAYABLE

    Effective  November 1, 2010, the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored  funds,  entered into a one year,
    $250,000,000 committed,  secured revolving line of credit with State Street Bank and Trust Company. The
    Fund is limited to $34,800,000 (the "Borrower Sublimit Amount") of the secured revolving line of credit
    with a  maximum  borrowing  limit of 15% of the  Fund's  Members'  Capital.  The  interest  rate on the
    borrowing  is the higher of (a) 1.50%  above the  Overnight  LIBOR Rate and (b) 1.50% above the Federal
    Funds Rate, in each case as in effect from time to time. There is a commitment fee payable by the Fund,
    calculated at 25 basis points per annum of the Borrower Sublimit Amount not utilized.

    For the year ended  December 31, 2010,  the Fund did not borrow  under this secured  revolving  line of
    credit.

7.  INVESTMENTS

    As of December 31, 2010,  the Fund had  investments  in  Investment  Funds,  none of which were related
    parties.

    Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investment for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted
    to $84,186,795 and $41,112,842, respectively.

    The cost of  investments  for  federal  income tax  purposes is  adjusted  for items of taxable  income
    allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds. The allocated  taxable income is reported to the Fund
    by the Investment  Funds on Schedule K-1. The Fund has not yet received all such Schedule K-1's for the
    year ended December 31, 2010; therefore, the tax basis of investments for 2010 will not be finalized by
    the Fund until after the fiscal year end.

    The  agreements  related to  investments in Investment  Funds provide for  compensation  to the general
    partners/managers  in the form of  management  fees of 1.00% to 2.00%  (per  annum) of net  assets  and
    performance incentive fees or allocations ranging from 20.00% to 25.00% of net profits earned. Detailed
    information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

Complete  information about the Investment Funds' underlying investments is not readily available.

The following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund's  investments at fair value.  The inputs or methodology  used for
valuing the Fund's  investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk  associated with investing in those  investments.  The
Fund's valuation  procedures require  evaluation of all relevant factors available at the time the Fund values its portfolio.  These
relevant factors include the individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair value measurements,  price transparency and valuation
procedures in place, and subscription and redemption activity.

The Fund's  investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed  below.  Level 1 discloses the amount of investments  where the
values of those investments are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 discloses the amount of
investments  where the Fund has the ability to redeem at net asset value as of the December 31, 2010 measurement date, or within one
year of the measurement  date. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund does not have the ability to redeem at net
asset value within one year of the December  31, 2010  measurement  date.  There were no  transfers  between  Level 1 and Level 2 at
December 31, 2010.

                                             UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

     The Directors (including the Independent  Directors) last evaluated the Investment Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September
16, 2010.  The  Directors  met in an executive  session  during which they were advised by and had the  opportunity  to discuss with
independent legal counsel the approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement.  The Directors reviewed materials furnished by UBS Fund
Advisor,  L.L.C. (the "Adviser"),  including  information  regarding the Adviser,  its affiliates and its personnel,  operations and
financial condition. The Directors also reviewed information regarding UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC ("UBS A&Q"),
its affiliates and its personnel,  operations and financial  condition in light of the transition of management of the Fund from the
Adviser to UBS A&Q as of October 1, 2010. Tables indicating comparative fee information, and comparative performance information, as
well as a summary financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and were reviewed and discussed.  The
Directors discussed with  representatives of the Adviser and UBS A&Q the Fund's operations and UBS A&Q's ability to provide advisory
and other services to the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed,  among  other  things,  the nature of the  advisory  services  to be provided to the Fund by UBS A&Q,
including its investment process, and the experience of the investment advisory and other personnel proposing to provide services to
the Fund.  The Directors  discussed  the ability of UBS A&Q to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's stated
investment  objectives and policies,  as well as the services to be provided by UBS A&Q to the Fund,  including  administrative  and
compliance services, oversight of Fund accounting,  marketing services,  assistance in meeting legal and regulatory requirements and
other services necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Directors acknowledged UBS A&Q's employment of highly skilled investment
professionals,  research analysts and  administrative,  legal and compliance staff members to ensure that a high level of quality in
compliance and  administrative  services  would be provided to the Fund.  The Directors also  recognized the benefits which the Fund
derives  from the  resources  available  to UBS A&Q and UBS A&Q's  affiliates,  including  UBS AG and UBS  Financial  Services  Inc.
Accordingly,  the Directors felt that the quality of service offered by the Adviser,  and to be offered by UBS A&Q, to the Fund were
appropriate, and that UBS A&Q personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

     The Directors  reviewed the  performance  of the Fund and compared that  performance  to the  performance  of other  investment
companies  presented by the Adviser which had objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund and which are managed by other,
third-party investment advisers (the "Comparable Funds"). The Directors recognized that the Comparable Funds, private funds, are not
subject to certain  investment  restrictions  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 that are applicable to the Fund of which can
adversely affect the Fund's performance  relative to that of the Comparable Funds. The Directors observed that while the Fund's 2010
performance as of June 30, 2010 lagged the median  performance of the Comparable  Funds,  it exceeded the median  performance of the
relevant indexes (HFRI Sector:  Technology Index, S&P 500 DRI, NASDAQ Composite Index and Morgan Stanley High Tech Index). The Board
also noted that the Fund's  performance for the three- and five-year periods ended June 30, 2010 exceeded the median  performance of
the relevant indexes. The Directors also compared the volatility of the Fund to that of the Comparable Funds. The Directors observed
that for the

<S>                                                  <C>
three- and five-year  periods ended June 30, 2010, the Fund's volatility was below the median volatility of the Comparable Funds and
relevant indexes.

     The  Directors  considered  the  advisory  fees being  charged by the Adviser for its services to the Fund as compared to those
charged to the  Comparable  Funds,  and as compared to the  advisory  fees charged by the Adviser and its  affiliates  for other UBS
alternative  investment products.  The information presented to the Directors showed that the Fund's management fee was equal to the
median management fee of the Comparable Funds and that the Fund's incentive fee was below the median incentive fee of the Comparable
Funds.  In comparing the advisory fees being  charged to the Fund to the fees being  charged by the Adviser and its  affiliates  for
other UBS alternative  investment products, it was noted that the Fund's management fee was equal to the lowest management fee being
charged to the other  multi-manager  funds,  although the Fund's incentive fee was above the median  incentive of the  multi-manager
funds.  In light of the foregoing,  the Directors felt that the combination of management fee and incentive fee being charged to the
Fund was  appropriate  and was within the overall range of the fees paid by the Comparable  Funds and other relevant UBS alternative
investment products.

     The Directors  also  considered the  profitability  to UBSFA or UBS A&Q, as the case may be, both before payment to brokers and
after payment to brokers and concluded that the profits to be realized by UBSFA or UBS A&Q, as the case may be, and their affiliates
under the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement and from other  relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA or UBS A&Q, as the case may
be, were within a range the Directors considered reasonable and appropriate. The Directors also discussed the fact that the Fund was
not large enough at that time to support a request for breakpoints due to economies of scale. The Directors determined that the fees
under the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  did not  constitute  fees that are so  disproportionally  large as to bear no reasonable
relationship to the services  rendered and that could not have been the product of arm's length  bargaining,  and concluded that the
fees were reasonable.  The Directors  concluded that approval of the Investment  Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the
Fund and its investors.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                                      UBSAQ
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBSAQ votes proxies for each fund (each a "Fund," collectively, the
"Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as such, has adopted these
Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies and Procedures"). The
Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in unregistered investment
vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other than the Fund.
Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets in non-voting
securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do not submit
matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted for vote
and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund, the Adviser
will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the Fund and in
accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of Directors (the
"Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures as the Funds'.
The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's Policies and
Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

     -    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
          Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
          an impending proxy vote;

     -    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
          personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
          outcome of a shareholder vote;

Revised: June 26, 2006
Rebranded: 10/1/2010

<PAGE>

     -    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
          manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
          management, have a personal interest through investment in the
          Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     -    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in
          the outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either
          the Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances. If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material,
the Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

     -    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
          consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
          board of directors);

     -    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
          its behalf;

     -    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
          based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     -    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
          given the nature of the conflict.

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

Revised: June 26, 2006
Rebranded: 10/1/2010

<PAGE>

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

     -    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     -    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     -    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
          related materials with regard to each vote;

     -    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution
          of conflicts of interest;

     -    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
          proxy - voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
          decision; and

     -    A copy of each written investor request for information on how the
          Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any
          written response from the Adviser to any (written or oral) investor
          request for information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of
          the Fund(s).

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder, Joseph
M. Sciortino and Matthew Woodbury, the other members of the portfolio management
team, are jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's
investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception. He
served as head of UBS Alternative Investments US' ("AI - US") portfolio
management group from 1998 to 2010, prior to his group joining UBS Alternative
and Quantitative Investments LLC, the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser").
He is also currently an Executive Director of the Adviser. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2007. Mr. Sinder was associated with AI - US
from 1998 to 2010, prior to joining the Adviser, and is an Executive Director of
the Adviser. Mr. Sciortino joined the portfolio management team in 2007. He was
associated with AI - US from December 2006 to October 2010, prior to joining the
Adviser, and is a Director of the Adviser. Previously, Mr. Sinder served as
Senior Analyst at Lake Partners, Inc. from April 2001 through August 2006. Mr.
Woodbury was associated with AI - US from 2008 to 2010, prior to joining the
Adviser, and is a Director of the Adviser. Previously, he served as an Analyst
at Allianz Hedge Fund Partners, LP (2002-2008) and an Accountant at Arthur
Anderson LLP (1999-2002).

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

<PAGE>

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel of the
Adviser periodically review the performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by the Adviser or its affiliates and not by the
Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of stock or
stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser, subject to
certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's discretionary
bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of UBS AG, is
determined by senior officers of the Adviser. In general, the amount of the
bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which is necessarily
weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include: the overall
performance of the Adviser; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability
to the Adviser derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts
managed by the Adviser; the absolute performance of the Fund and such other
accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio Manager to
assisting in managing the Adviser; participation by the Portfolio Manager in
training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio Manager generally to
colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other
metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
