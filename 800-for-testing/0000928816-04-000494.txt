Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Looking back on the past six months in financial markets, stocks and
bonds had generally steady and satisfying results for most of the
period. Markets were lifted by the resurgence of the economy, prompted
in part by the 2003 tax cuts and the Federal Reserve Board's low
interest-rate policy. Corporate earnings rose to their most impressive
levels in years and many states even experienced a minor improvement in
tax revenues. However, since March 2004, uncertainty and volatility have
returned to the markets. Bonds in particular experienced broad setbacks
in April because of concerns that inflation could be sparked by vigorous
job creation and rising energy prices. Markets continue to show
vulnerability to these concerns and to the situation in Iraq.

As observers of financial markets for many years, we have gained the
perspective that periods of uncertainty and transition like the one we
are witnessing today usually reflect an effort by investors to
incorporate new facts into their thinking, a process that takes time.
The resulting volatility is uncomfortable, but over time, allows
investors to set more realistic expectations for future investment
performance. Uncertainty on its own is no reason to alter a well-planned
investment strategy.

Putnam's portfolio management teams have vigilantly monitored these
conditions. While the retreat in financial markets has been broad, the
teams have relied on their research and analysis to manage risks and
identify opportunities.

The first half of Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust's fiscal year
was another positive period for the fund, during which at NAV it
outperformed its benchmark and competitor group, based on results at net
asset value. The fund's results were due in part to its emphasis on
lower-quality, higher-yielding bonds, which performed well as the
economy recovered. A few of its older, weaker holdings rose in value
sufficiently to overcome disappointments from some other holdings, as
described in the following report from your fund's managers. The fund's
relatively short duration and emphasis on tobacco-related holdings also
contributed to performance.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

 * For the six months ended April 30, 2004, Putnam Managed Municipal
   Income Trust provided total returns of 3.82% at net asset value (NAV)
   and -2.49% at market price.

 * The fund's performance at NAV was significantly ahead of its
   benchmark, the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, which returned 1.19% for the
   period. This reflected positive performance of some of the fund's
   lower-rated securities, its emphasis on tobacco-related securities, and
   its use of leverage.

 * The fund's portfolio composition also helped results at NAV, which
   were ahead of the average for Lipper's High Yield Municipal Debt Funds
   (closed-end) category of 3.09% for the period.

 * See the Performance Summary beginning on page 7 for complete fund
   performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

Continued economic recovery during the six-month period contributed to
improving credit quality in the lower-quality sector of the municipal
bond market. The fund's favorable results at NAV reflect this trend.
However, no one sector was responsible for the fund's success. Rather,
returns from specific fund holdings over a variety of sectors were
strong enough to overcome disappointments in a few holdings. In general,
diversification remains a strong theme for the fund -- one that seems to
be working well in this volatile period. As part of our diversification
efforts, we also continued reducing the fund's airline-related
industrial development bond (IDB) holdings, which had appreciated, and
slightly increased its exposure to tobacco-related bonds, also with
positive results. Lower-quality, higher-yielding bonds performed well
and some of the fund's distressed holdings made meaningful recoveries.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust seeks to provide as high a level
of current income free from federal income tax as is consistent with
preservation of capital through investments in investment-grade and
higher-yielding, lower-rated municipal bonds. The fund is designed for
investors seeking tax-exempt income and willing to accept the risks
associated with below-investment-grade bonds.

The performance of fund shares at market price reflects changes in
investor demand as well as the fund's investment results, and we believe
the poor showing during the fund's semiannual period reflected investor
concern that interest rates might increase. This sentiment was most
marked as the period drew to a close.


Market overview

Yields for municipal bonds -- which move in the opposite direction of
bond prices -- were volatile between November 1, 2003, and March 31,
2004. Yields trended downward for much of the period but corrected
sharply in late March and April in response to stronger economic data.
Yields on 10-year AAA-rated municipal bonds ended the semiannual period
slightly higher then they had been at the beginning of the period. The
ratio of municipal bond yields to Treasury yields fell to about 80% in
December, which means the spread, a difference between the yields of
10-year municipal bonds and 10-year Treasuries, was larger than in
previous periods. The ratio edged up to about 87% by the end of the
fiscal period. Overall, the yield curve, which shows the difference in
yield between shorter- and longer-maturity bonds, flattened somewhat,
and credit spreads -- the difference in yield between higher- and
lower-rated bonds -- generally narrowed. The economy continued to
improve on nearly all fronts, including job growth. The Federal Reserve
Board held the federal funds rate steady at 1%, but hinted at a
potential rate hike in the near future. Municipal bond issuance
continued to be very strong as states and municipalities sought to
address budget shortfalls that resulted from decreased tax revenues.
California residents approved a plan to issue $15 billion in debt to
help with the state's budget crisis. Although ongoing tobacco litigation
continued to make headlines, the municipal bond market largely
discounted the news. Airline-related IDBs continued to perform well.

Strategy overview

In an increasingly strong economy, it appears likely to us that interest
rates will rise further. Consequently, we shortened the fund's duration
(a measure of its sensitivity to changes in interest rates) during the
period. At the start of November, the fund was slightly defensive
relative to the benchmark. In January 2004, we shortened the duration
further. This move did not help the fund's performance until later in
the period.

We took the opportunity afforded by strong demand for higher-yielding
municipal bonds to sell into strength where appropriate. We also
continued to diversify the portfolio by adding selectively to the fund's
lower-quality holdings. Compared to the benchmark, the portfolio remains
slightly overweight in lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds.

We carefully monitored developments in the tobacco industry,
particularly with regard to ongoing litigation and other factors
affecting demand for tobacco settlement bonds, which are secured by the
income stream from tobacco companies' settlement obligations to the
states. The municipal bond market has largely ignored recent unfavorable
headlines and the downgrading of some tobacco settlement bonds by
Moody's rating service. In our view, the backdrop for the tobacco
industry remains fundamentally positive, and the fund remains overweight
in these bonds, relative to the benchmark. When valuations looked
compelling, we added to the fund's exposure.

How fund holdings affected performance

Although there were no significant sector standouts during the fund's
semiannual period, certain lower-rated industrial development bonds
(IDBs) performed well for the fund as overall economic growth improved
prospects for some holdings. IDBs are municipal bonds issued to finance
local expansion by various businesses and are backed by revenues from
the companies benefiting from the financing. As a result, their prices
are affected by investor perceptions of the health of the backing
company, the industry, and the economy as a whole. A number of the
fund's older IDB holdings have underperformed due to factors such as
these, but during the semiannual period, several of them made
substantial recoveries that contributed to performance. One health-care
holding that did especially well was the fund's position in Waterford
Economic Development revenue bonds for Canterbury Health in Michigan.
These rated bonds had a coupon of 6% and mature in 2039. Another
position, which had been in distress, was California's Valley Health
System Hospital Revenue Bonds. These issues had a 6.5% coupon and mature
in 2025. We took advantage of their improvement to trim, but not
eliminate, the position.

The fund's position in Connector 2000 Association, Inc., South Carolina
Toll road revenue bonds also made a meaningful recovery during the
period. These bonds are rated B-, have a coupon of 5.375%, and mature in
2038. The traffic on this toll road had been below expectations and the
bonds had declined in price to the point where their current price
seemed to justify the risks of continuing to own the bonds. As the
economy strengthened, the price began to move up.

We also had resolution on two defaulted holdings, both for Vista
Hospital Systems: one for Corona, California Certificates of
Participation, with a coupon of 8.375% maturing in 2011, and another for
the same hospital system in San Luis Obispo, also with a coupon of
8.375% maturing in 2029. The sale of the hospital system closed in
January, bringing a higher price for the bonds than we had anticipated.

Standard & Poor's ratings; percentages may include unrated bonds
considered by Putnam Management to be of comparable quality. Ratings
will vary over time.


Disappointing holdings included Gilroy Revenue Bonds for Bonfante
Gardens Park in California. The bonds have a coupon of 8% and are
scheduled to mature in 2025. They were issued to fund a theme park that
has suffered from poor attendance. The park hopes to reduce its debt
load by selling some surrounding land. We continue to hold the position,
but the price depreciation hurt the fund. In another situation, we have
been in discussions for some time with the managers of Hoover Group, a
company that makes large industrial containers for shipping products and
raw materials. The fund owns IDBs issued for Hoover Group by Gage
County, Nebraska and Scott County, Kentucky, both with coupons of 8.5%.
These issues mature in 2007 and 2014, respectively. The poor economy and
competitive pricing have eroded revenues and the company has been
seeking concessions from debt holders. We were in the process of selling
some of the Hoover bonds as the fiscal period ended.

Recent acquisitions included a land-secured project and a utility --
both facets of our diversification strategy. One example is Mountain's
Edge, a development planned for outside Las Vegas, consisting of over
1,900 acres. The bonds are issued by Clark County, Nevada, Improvement
District #142. Their rating takes into account the early stage of the
project as well as its location, strong interest, and positive
supply/demand characteristics in the market. We also recently purchased
a bond issued by Nassau County, New York, for Brooklyn Union Gas
Company, doing business in New York and New England as KeySpan Energy
Services. Keyspan is enjoying strong increases in operating income and
helps us maintain diversity by sector, issuer, and credit quality.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in  accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary
in the future.

The fund's management team

The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

Lingering unemployment had been an anomaly in an otherwise robust
economic recovery. However, in early April, employment data at last
showed marked improvement. We believe the underlying strength in the
economy will foster higher interest rates in the future. In keeping with
our views, the fund's duration is now relatively short in order to keep
the portfolio defensively positioned. Generally, tax revenues cannot be
expected to grow significantly until personal and business earnings
experience meaningful increases. For much of the reporting period, we
expected that the credit quality of general obligation municipal bonds
(GOs) would remain under pressure in light of these revenue issues.
However, the gathering strength of the economic recovery, combined with
the efforts of key states such as California to address ongoing budget
issues, is now beginning to translate into credit upgrades for state
GOs. We expect this trend to continue over the near term. Although yield
spreads between high- and low-quality municipal bonds have narrowed
somewhat, we believe they remain attractive and could narrow further. As
a result, we believe credit risk is worth taking in moderate amounts,
while we continue to seek diversification by sector and issuer. We will
continue to monitor market conditions as we pursue a high level of
tax-free income and seek to manage the fund's risk exposures.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Lower-rated bonds
may offer higher yields in return for more risk. Mutual funds that
invest in government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed
securities are subject to prepayment risk. Capital gains, if any, are
taxable for federal and, in most cases, state purposes. For some
investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Income from federally exempt funds may be subject to state
and local taxes.


Performance summary

This section shows your fund's performance during the first half of its
fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2004. In accordance with regulatory
requirements, we also include performance for the most current calendar
quarter-end. Performance should always be considered in light of a
fund's investment strategy. Data represents past performance. Past
performance does not guarantee future results. More recent returns may
be less or more than those shown. Investment return, net asset value,
and market price will fluctuate and you may have a gain or a loss when
you sell your shares.

Terms and definitions

Total return shows how the value of the fund's shares changed over time,
assuming you held the shares through the entire period and reinvested
all  distributions in the fund.

Net asset value (NAV) is the value of all your fund's assets, minus any
liabilities and the net assets allocated to remarketed preferred shares
divided by the number of outstanding common shares.

Market price is the current trading price of one share of the fund.
Market prices are set by transactions between buyers and sellers on
exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock
Exchange.

A note about duplicate mailings

In response to investors' requests, the SEC has modified mailing
regulations for proxy statements, semiannual and annual reports, and
prospectuses. Putnam is now able to send a single copy of these
materials to customers who share the same address. This change will
automatically apply to all shareholders except those who notify us. If
you would prefer to receive your own copy, please call Putnam at
1-800-225-1581.

Putnam is committed to managing our mutual funds in the best interests
of our shareholders. Our proxy voting guidelines and policies are
available on the Putnam Individual Investor Web site,

A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number
of the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net
investment income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting
period and the most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed
here may not match the sources listed in the Statement of operations
because the distributions are determined on a tax basis and may be paid
in a different period from the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results,   per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

  (a) Percentages indicated are based on portfolio market value.

(RAT) The Moody's or Standard & Poor's ratings indicated are believed to
      be the most recent ratings available at April 30, 2004 for the
      securities listed. Ratings are generally ascribed to securities at the
      time of issuance. While the agencies may from time to time revise such
      ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings do not
      necessarily represent what the agencies would ascribe to these
      securities at April 30, 2004. Securities rated by Putnam are indicated
      by "/P" and are not publicly rated.

(NON) Non-income-producing security.

(RES) Restricted, excluding 144A securities, as to public resale. The
      total market value of restricted securities held at April 30, 2004 was
      $22,492,269 or 4.1% of portfolio market value.

      144A after the name of a security represents those exempt from
      registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. These
      securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration,
      normally to qualified institutional buyers.

      The rates shown on IFB and IF COP, which are securities paying interest
      rates that vary inversely to changes in the market interest rates, VRDN
      and mandatory put bonds are the current interest rates at April 30,
      2004.

      The fund had the following industry group concentrations greater than
      10% at April 30, 2004

Notes to financial statements
April 30, 2004 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust (the "fund") is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment
objective is to seek a high level of current income exempt from federal
income tax. The fund intends to achieve its objective by investing in a
diversified portfolio of tax-exempt municipal securities which Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC, believes does not
involve undue risk to income or principal. Up to 50% of the fund's
assets may consist of high-yield tax-exempt municipal securities that
are below investment grade and involve special risk considerations. The
fund also uses leverage by issuing preferred shares in an effort to
increase the income to the common shares.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued at fair
value on the basis of valuations provided by an independent pricing
service, approved by the Trustees. Such services use information with
respect to transactions in bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between
securities in determining value. Other investments including restricted
securities are valued at fair value following procedures approved by the
Trustees. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed periodically by
the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in
excess of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date;
thereafter, any remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), as amended.
Therefore, no provision has been made for federal taxes on income,
capital gains or unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for
excise tax on income and capital gains.

At month October 31, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of
$50,158,346 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future
net capital gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration
dates are:

Loss Carryover    Expiration
- ----------------------------------
   $11,188,485    October 31, 2005
     2,894,998    October 31, 2006
     3,629,209    October 31, 2007
     1,237,146    October 31, 2008
     1,641,465    October 31, 2009
     3,729,886    October 31, 2010
    25,837,157    October 31, 2011

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $545,118,483, resulting
in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $19,932,437 and
$18,164,885, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of
$1,767,552.

D) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded
on the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on
remarketed preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by
the Trustees. Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares
is generally a 28-day period for Series A and Series B shares, and a
7-day period for Series C shares. The applicable dividend rate for the
remarketed preferred shares on April 30, 2004 was 1.05 % for Series A,
0.97% foe Series B and 1.04% for Series C. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.

E) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares
is determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets attributable to
common and preferred shares outstanding of the fund. Such fee is based
on 0.70% of the average weekly net assets attributable to common and
preferred shares outstanding.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to
the proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then
the fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by
the amount of the excess (but not more than 0.70% of the liquidation
preference of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the
period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended April 30, 2004, the
fund paid PFTC $172,478 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended April 30, 2004,
the fund's expenses were reduced by $9,848 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $755, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of assets
and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended April 30, 2004, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $59,748,242 and $46,254,897, respectively. There
were no purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A (550), Series B (550) and Series C (650) shares are
redeemable at the option of the fund on any dividend payment date at a
redemption price of $100,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any
dividends accumulated on a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption
date (whether or not such dividends have been declared) and, in certain
circumstances, a call premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income
and capital gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required
to apportion to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares
throughout that year additional dividends as necessary to result in an
after-tax equivalent to the applicable dividend rate for the period.
Total additional dividends for the period ended April 30, 2004 were
$1,069.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to
maintain asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed
preferred shares as of the last business day of each month in which any
such shares are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet
more stringent asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed
preferred shares and the shares' rating agencies. Should these
requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the remarketed
preferred shares not be paid, the fund may be restricted in its ability
to declare dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem
certain of the remarketed preferred shares. At April 30, 2004 no such
restrictions have been placed on the fund.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

On April 8, 2004, Putnam Management entered into agreements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities
Division representing a final settlement of all charges brought against
Putnam Management by those agencies on October 28, 2003 in connection
with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees and, in the case
of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities Division, by
participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans. The settlement
with the SEC requires Putnam Management to pay $5 million in
disgorgement plus a civil monetary penalty of $50 million, and the
settlement with the Massachusetts Securities Division requires Putnam
Management to pay $5 million in restitution and an administrative fine
of $50 million. The settlements also leave intact the process
established under an earlier partial settlement with the SEC under which
Putnam Management agreed to pay the amount of restitution determined by
an independent consultant, which may exceed the disgorgement and
restitution amounts specified above, pursuant to a plan to be  developed
by the independent consultant.

Putnam Management, and not the investors in any Putnam fund, will bear
all costs, including restitution, civil penalties and associated legal
fees stemming from both of these proceedings. The SEC's and
Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and related matters also
serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits, including purported
class action lawsuits filed against Putnam Management and certain
related parties, including certain Putnam funds. Putnam Management has
agreed to bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in connection with
these lawsuits. Based on currently available information, Putnam
Management believes that the likelihood that the pending private
lawsuits and purported class action lawsuits will have a material
adverse financial impact on the fund is remote, and the pending actions
are not likely to materially affect its ability to provide investment
management services to its clients, including the Putnam funds.

Review of these matters by counsel for Putnam Management and by separate
independent counsel for the Putnam funds and their  independent Trustees
is continuing.

        Not applicable

Item 10. Controls and Procedures:
- ---------------------------------

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded, based on their evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of
the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, that the design and
operation of such procedures are generally effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
the investment company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms.

Although such officers reached the conclusion expressed in the
preceding paragraph, they are aware of matters that raise concerns
with respect to controls, each of which arose in connection with the
administration of 401(k) plans by Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company.
The first matter, which occurred in early 2001, involved the willful
circumvention of controls by certain Putnam employees in connection
with the correction of operational errors with respect to a 401(k)
client's investment in certain Putnam Funds, which led to losses in
five Putnam Funds (not including the registrant). Such officers
became aware of this matter in February 2004. The second matter,
which occurred in 2002, involved the willful circumvention by
certain Putnam employees of policies and procedures in connection
with the payment of Putnam corporate expenses. Such officers did
not learn that this matter involved a Putnam Fund until January
2004. Putnam has made restitution to the affected Funds,
implemented a number of personnel changes, including senior
personnel, begun to implement changes in procedures to address these
items and informed the SEC, the Funds' Trustees and independent
auditors. An internal investigation and review of procedures and
controls are currently ongoing.

In reaching the conclusion expressed herein, the registrant's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer
considered a number of factors, including the nature of the matters
described above, when the matters occurred, the individuals
involved, personnel changes that have occurred since these matters
occurred, the results to date of the current ongoing investigation
and the overall quality of controls at Putnam at this time.
