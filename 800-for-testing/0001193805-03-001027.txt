Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

Now more than half behind us, 2003 has been a meaningful year in many respects.
After one of the most significant equity market downturns in many investors'
memories, this year finally brought hopeful signs for a sustainable economic
recovery. With that bit of good news, fixed income investments, which had become
the asset class of choice during the long equity market decline, were left to
perform on a new playing field.

The Federal Reserve Board continued its accommodative monetary policy into June
2003, when it brought the Federal Funds rate down to 1%, its lowest level since
1958. With this move, long-term interest rates continued to be volatile, as
investors began to anticipate the impact of future Federal Reserve Board moves
and economic revitalization. As of August 31, 2003, the ten-year Treasury bond
was yielding 4.47%. This compared to a yield of 3.69% six months earlier and
4.14% one year ago.

Against this backdrop, our portfolio managers continued to work diligently to
deliver on our commitment to provide superior performance within reasonable
expectations for risk and return. With that said, remember also that the advice
and guidance of a skilled financial advisor often can mean the difference
between fruitful and fruitless investing. A financial professional can help you
choose those investments that will best serve you as you plan for your financial
future.

Finally, I am proud to premiere a new look to our shareholder communications.
Our portfolio manager commentaries have been trimmed and organized in such a way
that you can get the information you need at a glance, in plain language.
Today's markets are confusing enough. We want to help you put it all in
perspective. The report's new size also allows us certain mailing efficiencies.
Any cost savings in production or postage are passed on to the Fund and,
ultimately, to Fund shareholders.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment
assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years ahead.

                                                Sincerely,


                                                /s/ Terry K. Glenn

                                                Terry K. Glenn
                                                President and Director

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Managers

      The high yield market continued its rally throughout the period, and Fund
performance benefited from a significant overweighting in this market.

How did the Fund perform in light of the existing market conditions?

During the period, the high yield market rallied as investors moved into
lower-rated securities in search of yield in the low interest rate environment.
Good supply, especially from the new-issue calendar, also attracted investors to
the market. Our significant allocation to high yield issues generated strong
returns for the Fund as a result.

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2003, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had a net annualized yield of 13.97%, based on a
period-end per share net asset value of $6.07 and $.427 per share income
dividends. Over the same period, the total return on the Fund's Common Stock was
+21.36%, based on a change in per share net asset value from $5.35 to $6.07, and
assuming reinvestment of $.420 per share ordinary income dividends. The Fund's
benchmark, which is an equal blend of the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High
Yield II Index and the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, returned +9.16% for the same
period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
the Financial Statements included in this report. As a closed-end fund, the
Fund's shares may trade in the secondary market at a premium or discount to the
Fund's net asset value. As a result, total investment returns based on changes
in the market value of the Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total
investment return based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.

Top-performing portfolio holdings included Mission Energy Holdings, one of the
Fund's largest positions. Mission rallied in price from 28 to 55 as investors
favorably reassessed the company's coal-fired generation capacity, especially in
light of rising natural gas prices and the fact that nearly all U.S. electrical
generating capacity additions over the past four years have been gas-fired
turbines. Charter Communications Holdings also performed strongly during the
period. A combination of factors have improved Charter's prospects, including a
favorable reappraisal of cable subscription valuations, which increases the
potential for a deleveraging event, and enhanced liquidity through a $300
million line of credit from Charter's owner, Paul Allen. We held several bond
positions and bank debt issued by Coaxial Communications, which also benefited
from the positive reappraisal of cable subscription valuations and a management
tender announcement in August.

Investments that detracted from performance during the period included
International Utility Structures (IUS), a manufacturer of overhead street
lighting and power line and tension support structures. IUS was subject to a
sharp price decline following a missed interest payment on August 1, 2003. These
notes will likely be exchanged following a financial restructuring of the
company. Archibald Candy Corporation, which manufactures and retails the Fannie
May and Fanny Farmer chocolate brands, also fell in price. Business results
following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 last January have been weak.
Vectura Group, a barge transportation company, continued to weaken during the
period because of depressed rates and an adverse working environment in the
inland waterways.

What changes did you make to the portfolio during the period?

We maintained our portfolio allocation of approximately 80% high yield bonds and
20% leveraged bank loans. During the period, we attempted to take advantage of
the recent updraft in the high yield market, exit or lighten up on those names
that reached 12-month highs or had, in our opinion, greater downside risk than
upside potential. In doing so, we created the liquidity to redeploy proceeds in
an attractive new-issue market.

We also maintained a below-market duration of less than four years during the
period. The goal was to lower the portfolio's sensitivity to a possible rise in
interest rates.

How would you characterize the portfolio's position at the close of the period?

We expect to maintain our allocation to high yield bonds at approximately 80%.
While the high yield market has rallied sharply over the last year, we believe
that conditions there remain positive. Low interest rates should prompt
investors to continue to seek yield in non-investment grade securities. At the
same time, access to relatively inexpensive capital for corporations will likely
result in a robust new-issue calendar. Leveraged buyouts, which typically
include a high yield bond component, are likely to pick up. Most importantly,
default rates, which had reached approximately 20% during 2001-2002, have
significantly decreased. This is due to the stronger economy, improving
underwriting standards and greater availability of capital, which has enabled
issuers to push out approaching debt maturities.

That being said, the Fund's structure provides the flexibility to shift
investments from the high yield market into the bank loan market should we
experience an unexpected inflationary shock. As such, we intend to maintain our
20% allocation to the bank loan market, increasing that allocation should the
inflation outlook deteriorate. We also expect to maintain the Fund's use of
leverage at approximately 30% of total assets. While leverage can potentially
hinder total return in a weak market, the converse also is true. A leverage
strategy adds to incremental yield, but increases volatility in both weak and
strong markets. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of
leveraging, see page 2 of this report to shareholders.)

*     Not Rated.
**    Floating rate corporate debt in which the Fund invests generally pays
      interest at rates that are periodically redetermined by reference to a
      base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally
      (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European banks, such as
      LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one
      or more major United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit
      rate. Corporate loans represent 24.8% of the Fund's net assets.
+     Non-income producing security.
++    For Fund compliance purposes, "Industries" means any one or more of the
      industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market
      indexes or ratings group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management.
      This definition may not apply for purposes of this report, which may
      combine such industry sub-classifications for reporting ease.
(a)   Floating rate note.
(b)   Represents a pay-in-kind security which may pay interest/dividends in
      additional face/shares.
(c)   Represents a zero coupon or step bond; the interest rate on a step bond
      will commence its accrual at a fixed rate of interest on a predetermined
      date until maturity.
(d)   The security may be offered and sold to "qualified institutional buyers"
      under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.
(e)   Each Equity Right entitles the Fund to purchase one share of new Preferred
      Stock at a price of $10.80 per Equity Right.
(f)   Mortgage-Backed Obligations are subject to principal paydowns as a result
      of prepayments or refinancing of the underlying mortgage instruments. As a
      result, the average life may be substantially less than the original
      maturity.
(g)   Warrants entitle the Fund to purchase a predetermined number of shares of
      common stock and are non-income producing. The purchase price and number
      of shares are subject to adjustment under certain conditions until the
      expiration date.
(h)   Restricted securities as to resale. The value of the Fund's investments in
      restricted securities was approximately $400,000, representing 0.1% of net
      assets.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which may require the use of management accruals and estimates. These unaudited
financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period
presented. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Fund
determines and makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common
Stock on a weekly basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations--The Fund invests principally in debt obligations
of companies, including Corporate Loans made by banks and other financial
institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds and notes.
Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and other
financial institutions, the Fund's investment in Corporate Loans could be
considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments--Corporate Loans are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Corporate Loans are valued at
the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
number of Corporate Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
Corporate Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
pricing matrices to determine valuations. If the pricing service does not
provide a value for the Corporate Loan, the Investment Adviser will value the
loan at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
NASDAQ National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available ask price for
short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange,
the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of the Fund. Long positions in securities
traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market, NASDAQ Small Cap or Bulletin
Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of the Fund.
Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued at the last
available ask price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in the OTC market
and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the premium
received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an equivalent
liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to reflect the
current market value of the option written, based on the last sale price in the
case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the OTC
market, the last ask price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued at their
last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of
options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. The value of swaps,
including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, will be determined by obtaining
dealer quotations. Other investments, including futures contracts and related
options, are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Investment Adviser believes
that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase agreements will
be valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Fund employs certain pricing
services to provide securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors of the Fund,
including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the Fund,
which may use a matrix system for valuations. The procedures of a pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general supervision of the Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Directors.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities
and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various
times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of
such times. Foreign currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior
to the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values
of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which
they are determined and the close of business on the NYSE that may not be
reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for
example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural disaster) occur
during such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, those securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or by the Investment Adviser using a
pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(c) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movement and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts--The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options--The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase call
      and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the
      premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent
      liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to
      reflect the current market value of the option written. When a security is
      purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the related premium
      paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the basis of the
      security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds of the
      security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a closing
      transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent
      of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost
      of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps--The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are over-the-counter
      contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net
      payments on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for
      a set period of time or may be triggered by a pre-determined credit event.
      The net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest
      rate; the change in market value of a specified security, basket of
      securities, or index; or the return generated by a security.

(d) Foreign currency transactions--Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner. FAM has entered into a Sub-Advisory
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Asset Management U.K. Limited ("MLAM U.K."), an
affiliate of FAM, pursuant to which MLAM U.K. provides investment

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

advisory services to FAM with respect to the Fund. There is no increase in the
aggregate fees paid by the Fund for these services.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

In addition, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a subsidiary of
ML & Co., received $4,500 in commissions on the execution of portfolio security
transactions for the Fund for the six months ended August 31, 2003.

For the six months ended August 31, 2003, the Fund reimbursed FAM $7,403 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, MLAM U.K., PSI, and/or ML & Co.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the six
months ended August 31, 2003 were $295,728,211 and $286,667,102, respectively.

Net realized losses for the six months ended August 31, 2003 and net unrealized
losses as of August 31, 2003 were as follows:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide current income by investing
primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies' debt instruments,
including corporate loans, that are rated in the lower rating categories of the
established rating services (Baa or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
BBB or lower by Standard & Poor's) or unrated debt instruments of comparable
quality.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus. Past performance results shown in this report should not be
considered a representation of future performance. The Fund leverages its Common
Stock to provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of
return. Leverage creates risk for Common Stock shareholders, including the
likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common
Stock shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may
reduce the Common Stock's yield. Statements and other information herein are as
dated and are subject to change.

Item 7 - For closed-end funds that contain voting securities in their portfolio,

         vote proxies relating to those portfolio securities.

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that the Investment Adviser considers
         the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not the
         interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that real
         (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the Investment
         Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's clients are
         properly addressed and resolved.

<PAGE>

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except
         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

<PAGE>

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
            to the period covered by this report; and

      3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
            information included in this report, fairly present in all material

            the periods presented in this report;

      4.    The Fund's other certifying officers and I are responsible for

                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under

                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

                  control over financial reporting that occurred during the
                  Fund's most recent fiscal half-year (the Fund's second fiscal
                  half-year in the case of an annual report) that has materially
                  affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the

      5.    The Fund's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based

            a)    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  Fund's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
