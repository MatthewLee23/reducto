                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are

report and other Fund regulatory filings.

                  SEMI-ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                               NOVEMBER 30, 2012


Dear Shareholders:

I am pleased to present you with the semi-annual report for your investment in
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund").

The report you hold contains detailed information about your investment; a
portfolio commentary from the Fund's management team that provides a recap of
the period; a performance analysis and a market and Fund outlook. Additionally,
you will find the Fund's financial statements for the period this report covers.
I encourage you to read this document and discuss it with your financial
advisor. A successful investor is also typically a knowledgeable one, as we have
found to be the case at First Trust.

First Trust remains committed to being a long-term investor and investment
manager and to bringing you quality financial solutions regardless of market ups
and downs. We have always believed, as I have written previously, that there are
two ways to attain success in reaching your financial goals: staying invested in
quality products and having a long-term investment horizon. We are committed to
this approach in the products we manage or supervise and offer to investors.

As you know, First Trust offers a variety of products that we believe could fit
many financial plans to help investors seeking long-term investment success. We
encourage you to talk to your advisor about the other investments First Trust
offers that might also fit your financial goals and to discuss those goals with
your advisor regularly so that he or she can help keep you on track.

First Trust will continue to make available up-to-date information about your
investments so you and your financial advisor are current on any First Trust
investments you own. We value our relationship with you, and thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals. I look forward to
the New Year and to the next edition of your Fund's report.


Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

                                   COMMENTARY

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Advisor pursues
the Fund's objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior loans. There can be
no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund
may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

Despite numerous macro headline risks, including the European debt crisis, the
fiscal cliff, and the U.S. presidential election, the senior loan market
provided steadily positive returns for the six-month period ended November 30,
2012. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the "Index") provided a return of 4.80%
for the six-month period, posting a positive return in each of the six monthly
periods. The consistent positive performance for the reporting period was put to
the test in the final month as the equity markets sold off sharply following the
presidential election. While loan prices generally softened in mid-November, the
income generated by the Index's senior loan assets more than covered any price
volatility, which allowed its total return to remain positive in this period of
volatility.

From a credit quality standpoint, lower credit-quality issues provided the best
performance over the reporting period. Lower-rated CCC rated issues returned
10.91% for the period, significantly outperforming the higher credit quality B
rated issues (+4.67%) and BB rated issues (+3.78%).

A combination of relatively stable financial performance on the part of senior
loan issuers and robust demand for the asset class supported the strong returns
for the period. The default level in the market remained low, supported by
generally good corporate performance and attractive capital market conditions,
allowing issuers to refinance existing debt. The default rate within the senior
loan market ended November at 1.28%, and remains significantly below the
long-term average default rate of 3.38% (period March 1999 - November 2012). On
the demand side, we have witnessed significant demand from


                                                                          Page 3

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                               NOVEMBER 30, 2012


institutional investors along with positive inflows into retail senior loan
mutual funds, which have provided support for loan prices. We believe many
investors have been attracted by the relatively high income, senior secured
position in the capital structure, and floating rate nature (which may limit
risk in rising interest rate environments) of the asset class. These positive
factors helped drive the average loan price in the market up over 2 points from
94.8 at the start of the period to 97.2 at the end of November.

Overall, the fundamental and technical conditions within the senior loan market
were quite positive over the period, which led to robust returns.

FUND PERFORMANCE

For the six-month period ended November 30, 2012, the Fund generated a net asset
value ("NAV") return(1) of 6.57% and a market price return of 9.99%. The Fund's
market price moved from a discount to NAV at the start of the period, to a
premium to NAV at the end of November. At the start of the period, the Fund
traded at a -0.83% discount to NAV and at the end of November the Fund was
trading at a 2.15% premium to NAV.

From an income perspective, the Fund increased its monthly distribution four
times over the reporting period. The monthly distribution rate began the period
at $0.08 per share and ended the period at $0.0875 per share, a 9.4% increase in
the distribution rate. At the end of November, the $0.0875 distribution rate
translated into a 6.89% yield at market price and a 7.04% yield at NAV.

The Fund's NAV return outperformed the Index by 177 basis points (6.57% for the
Fund, 4.80% for the Index). (While the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index consists of
leveraged loans, the index itself is not leveraged.) The Fund was significantly
underweight lower credit quality issues (2.40% rated CCC or lower in the Fund
vs. 8.86% for the Index), which detracted from relative returns for the period
as those lower-quality issues provided the strongest returns on average.
However, the Fund benefited from the use of leverage as well as good issue
selection across several industries. While the lower credit-quality issues in
the market showed strong returns for the period, the investment team continues
to believe that a more favorable risk/reward profile can currently be achieved
in higher credit rated issues.

An important factor impacting the return of the Fund relative to its benchmark
was the Fund's use of financial leverage through the use of bank borrowings. The
Fund uses leverage because its managers believe that, over time, leverage
provides opportunities for additional income and total return for common
shareholders. However, the use of leverage also can expose common shareholders
to additional volatility. For example, as the prices of securities held by the
Fund decline, the negative impact of the valuation changes on common share net
asset value and common shareholder total return is magnified by the use of
leverage. Conversely, leverage may enhance common share returns during periods
when the prices of securities held by the Fund generally are rising.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

In our view, the senior loan market continues to offer some compelling
opportunities. Senior loan issuers have shown the ability to continue to perform
well given an economic backdrop characterized by modest GDP growth and low
inflation. We expect this environment to persist for some time, which bodes well
for the asset class. Issuers generally will be able to service debt levels in a
slow growth environment, which should keep default rates at a modest level.
These positive fundamentals should also help support the technical conditions in
the market. Demand for the asset class is likely to remain strong in our view,
as the combination of relatively high income, senior secured position in the
capital structure, and floating interest rate nature of the asset class may
still remain appealing to investors.

We expect our rigorous credit process and focus on identifying the most
compelling risk-adjusted return opportunities in the market will continue to
position the portfolio well for the periods ahead. The portfolio strategy of
balancing the goal of high current income with portfolio risk remains unchanged.
We do not anticipate changing the average credit quality of the portfolio in a
meaningful way going forward. In the upcoming periods, we expect the new issue
market to remain healthy, thereby potentially providing additional
opportunities, which may enhance the portfolio characteristics. The combination
of attractive new issuance and our focus on relative value opportunities across
the market should continue to position the Fund's portfolio well for the periods
ahead.

    banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
    prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
    certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
    floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
    reflects the rate in effect at November 30, 2012.
(d) Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
    prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
    be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

    exempt from registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
    to Financial Statements).
(k) This Senior Loan is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
    whereby 1.00% of interest per annum is to be paid in cash and 13.75% of
    interest per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely
    in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) a combination
    thereof. Interest is to be paid semi-annually, however, the issuer is in
    default and income is not being accrued.
(l) Non-income producing security.
(m) Aggregate cost for financial reporting purposes, which approximates the
    aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes. As of November 30, 2012,
    the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which
    there was an excess of value over tax cost was $5,950,240 and the
    aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
    was an excess of tax cost over value was $7,490,366.

* See the Portfolio of Investments for the industry breakout. Industry
categories are only shown separately if they include holdings in two or more
levels or have holdings in only Level 3.

**  Market value is less than $1.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.

All transfers in and out of Level 3 during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. As of November
30, 2012, the Fund transferred Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests valued at
$4,998,582 from Level 3 to Level 2 and $7,555,110 from Level 2 to Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. The Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests that transferred
between Level 3 and Level 2 did so primarily as a result of additional
information obtained from an independent third party pricing vendor relating to
the market activity of individual Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests. Level 3
Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are valued based on third party pricing
service prices obtained from dealer runs and indicative sheets from brokers.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans").1 There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily in accordance with valuation procedures
adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with provisions of
the 1940 Act. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and
sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. The third party
pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from dealer runs and
broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior Loans.

Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or foreign
exchange (excluding the NASDAQ(R) Stock Market, LLC ("NASDAQ") and the London
Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at the last
sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded or, for NASDAQ
and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price or official closing
price, as applicable, at the close of the securities exchange representing the
principal market for such securities.

Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when purchased
are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.

In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation, or the valuations received are deemed
unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities.
Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal markets for
certain securities (e.g., domestic debt securities and foreign securities) that
could materially affect the Fund's NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method
to value the Fund's securities. The use of fair value pricing is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act. As a general principle, the fair value of a
security is the amount which the Fund might reasonably

1    The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
     Financial Statements include Senior Loans.

                                                                         Page 23

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


expect to receive for the security upon its current sale. In light of the
judgment involved in fair valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair
value assigned to a particular security will be the amount which the Fund might
be able to receive upon its current sale. Fair valuation of a security is based
on the consideration of all available information, including, but not limited
to, the following:

  1) the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;

  2) an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which these
     securities are purchased and sold;

  3) the type, size and cost of the security;

  4) the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;

  5) the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on the
     Advisor's or external analysis;

  6) the information as to any transactions in or offers for the security;

  7) the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or equity
     securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;

  8) the coupon payments;

  9) the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing the
     security;

 10) the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability to
     obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an assessment of
     the borrower's/issuer's management;

 11) the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples (of
     earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in that
     industry;

 12) borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;

 13) borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through public
     and/or private markets; and

 14) other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

    o Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
      identical investments. An active market is a market in which transactions
      for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
      pricing information on an ongoing basis.

    o Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
      indirectly, and include the following:

             o Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

             o Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
             that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where there
             are few transactions for the investment, the prices are not
             current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or
             among market makers, or in which little information is released
             publicly.

             o Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
             investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable
             at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss
             severities, credit risks, and default rates).

             o Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
             observable market data by correlation or other means.

    o Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may
      reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that
      market participants would use in pricing the investment.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of November 30, 2012, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
didn't have any when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments as
of November 30, 2012.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
$546,667 as of November 30, 2012.

                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
November 30, 2012, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. These securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as
stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a
discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There
are no unrestricted investments with the same maturity dates and yields for
these issuers.

(1) Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July 31,
2007.

E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2012 and is as follows:


Distributions paid from:
Ordinary income................................................  $  21,979,654

As of May 31, 2012, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income..................................  $   2,161,651
Undistributed capital gains....................................             --
                                                                 -------------
Total undistributed earnings...................................      2,161,651
Accumulated capital and other losses...........................   (105,285,525)
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).....................    (10,932,143)
                                                                 -------------
Total accumulated earnings (losses)............................   (114,056,017)
Other..........................................................             --
Paid-in capital................................................    481,227,780
                                                                 -------------
Net assets.....................................................  $ 367,171,763
                                                                 =============

F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

                                                                         Page 25

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses recognized after December 31, 2010, may be carried forward
indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term and/or long-term
losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for up to eight
years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the Act requires
that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment net capital
losses. At May 31, 2012, the Fund had pre-enactment net capital losses for
federal income tax purposes of $105,285,525 expiring as follows:

         EXPIRATION DATE             AMOUNT
         May 31, 2014         $   3,143,970
         May 31, 2016             3,611,723
         May 31, 2017            25,585,953
         May 31, 2018            68,278,827
         May 31, 2019             4,663,095

During the taxable year ended May 31, 2012, the Fund utilized pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $840,490.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending 2009, 2010,
2011 and 2012 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2012,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois corporation
controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First Trust. First
Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's investment
portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee
calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets (the average
daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's liabilities
other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also provides fund
reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund's Administrator,
Fund Accountant and Transfer Agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements.
The Bank of New York Mellon serves as the Fund's Custodian in accordance with
certain fee arrangements.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer of $125,000 per year and an annual per fund fee of $4,000 for each
closed-end fund or other actively managed fund and $1,000 for each index fund in
the First Trust Fund Complex. The fixed annual retainer is allocated pro rata
among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $15,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $10,000 annually, and each of the
Chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Valuation Committee
is paid $5,000 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation
allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net
assets. Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and each Committee
Chairman will serve two-year terms until December 31, 2013, before rotating to
serve as chairman of another committee or as Lead Independent Trustee. After
December 31, 2013, the Lead Independent Trustee and Committee Chairmen will
rotate every three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no
compensation from the funds for acting in such capacities.

                     4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2012, were $258,733,993 and
$253,971,243, respectively.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit
Facility") on July 13, 2012, with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender
and The Bank of Nova Scotia as secondary lender and agent for the secured
parties under the agreement. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of July
12, 2013, and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a
secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against
advances made to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund,
immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of at least
300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment
under the Credit Facility is $175,000,000. For the six months ended November 30,
2012, the average amount outstanding was $159,163,934. The loans under the
Credit Facility funded generally bear interest for each settlement period at a
rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the conduit lender. The
high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the Credit Facility
funded by the Conduit Lender during the six months ended November 30, 2012, were
0.46% and 0.24%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.28%.
The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at November 30, 2012 was
0.24%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which include a
utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.40% of the daily average of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar
month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.40% of
the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or if terminated, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded or maintained)
during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

                             6. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor determines that it is
temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is
impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and
trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities or "junk" debt. High-yield securities
should be considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less
than investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as
compared to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may

                                                                         Page 27

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK. Interest rate risk, primarily applicable to fixed-rate
securities, is the risk that the value of the debt securities in the Fund will
decline because of rising market interest rates.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK. Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy
experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become
distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in
sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to
raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by
Fund shareholders.

                           7. COMMON SHARE OFFERINGS

On November 21, 2012, the Fund and the Advisor entered into a sales agreement
with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC ("JonesTrading") whereby the Fund
may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 Common Shares from time to time through
JonesTrading as agent for the offer and sale of the Common Shares. Sales of
Common Shares pursuant to the sales agreement may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" as defined in
Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales
made through a market maker other than on an exchange, at an offering price
equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share of the Fund's Common
Shares at the time such Common Shares are initially sold. The Fund intends to
use the net proceeds from the sale of the Common Shares in accordance with its
investment objectives and policies. Transactions for the period ended November
30, 2012 related to offerings under such sales agreement are as follows:


                                                             NET PROCEEDS
      COMMON                                                 RECEIVED IN
      SHARES           NET PROCEEDS      NET ASSET VALUE     EXCESS OF
      SOLD             RECEIVED          OF SHARES SOLD      NET ASSET VALUE
    ---------         -------------      ---------------     ---------------
       3,558           $     54,058       $     53,067        $       991

Additionally, estimated offering costs of $175,000 related to this offering were
recorded as a prepaid asset and are being amortized to expense by the Fund on a
straight line basis over the lesser of one year or until the Fund sells
3,000,000 Common Shares related to this offering.

                               8. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there was
the following subsequent events:

On December 20, 2012, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0875 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on December 31, 2012, payable January 15, 2013.

On January 22, 2013, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0875 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on February 5, 2013, payable February 15, 2013.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

    (1)    If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
           the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
           equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii)
           95% of the market price on that date.

    (2)    If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
           Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
           purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere,
           for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price
           for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has
           completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per
           share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time
           of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the
           dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the
           Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions
           received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market within
           30 days of the valuation date except where temporary curtailment or
           suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with federal
           securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
           payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                        INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING APPROVAL OF CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
AGREEMENT

The Board of Trustees of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the
"Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, approved the continuation of the
Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement") between the Fund and First
Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") at a meeting held on June 10-11, 2012. The
Board determined that the continuation of the Agreement is in the best interests
of the Fund in light of the extent and quality of the services provided and such
other matters as the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of its
reasonable business judgment.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the 1940 Act,
as well as under the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving
advisory contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the
fiduciary duty of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and
compensation; the standards used by courts in determining whether investment
company boards have fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by
the Board in voting on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of
the Agreement, the Independent Trustees received a report from the Advisor in
advance of the Board meeting responding to a request for information from
counsel to the Independent Trustees. The report, among other things, outlined
the services provided by the Advisor (including the relevant personnel
responsible for these services and their experience); the advisory fees for the
Fund as compared to fees charged to other clients of the Advisor and as compared
to fees charged by investment advisors to comparable funds; expenses of the Fund
as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the nature of expenses
incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential for economies of
scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor; any fall-out benefits to the
Advisor; and information on the Advisor's compliance program. Following receipt
of this information, counsel to the Independent Trustees posed follow-up
questions, and the Independent Trustees and their counsel then met separately to
discuss the information provided by the Advisor, including the supplemental
responses. The Board applied its business judgment to determine whether the
arrangement between the Fund and the Advisor is a reasonable business
arrangement from the Fund's perspective as well as from the perspective of
shareholders. The Board considered that shareholders chose to invest or remain
invested in the Fund knowing that the Advisor manages the Fund. The Board also
considered that the Agreement was approved by shareholders of the Fund at a
meeting held in December 2010.

In reviewing the Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality
of services provided by the Advisor under the Agreement. The Board considered
that the Advisor is responsible for the overall management and administration of
the Fund and reviewed the services provided by the Advisor to the Fund, noting
that the Advisor's Leveraged Finance Team took over day-to-day management of the
Fund's investments from the former sub-advisor in October 2010. The Board
considered the Advisor's statement that it applies the same oversight model
internally with its Leveraged Finance Team as it uses for overseeing external
sub-advisors. The Board also received a presentation from members of the
Leveraged Finance Team discussing how they manage the Fund's investments. The
Board noted the compliance program that had been developed by the Advisor and
considered that it includes a robust program for monitoring compliance with the
1940 Act and the Fund's investment objectives and policies. In light of the
information presented and the considerations made, the Board concluded that the
nature, extent and quality of services provided to the Fund by the Advisor under
the Agreement have been and are expected to remain satisfactory and that the
Advisor has managed the Fund consistent with its investment objectives and
policies.

The Board considered the advisory fees paid under the Agreement. The Board
considered the advisory fees charged by the Advisor to similar funds and other
non-fund clients, noting that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to
other closed-end funds with investment objectives and policies similar to the
Fund's, but it does provide services to certain separately managed accounts with
investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's. The Board noted that
the Advisor charges a lower advisory fee rate to the separately managed
accounts, as well as the Advisor's statement that the nature of the services
provided to the separately managed

                         NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (UNAUDITED)


accounts is not comparable to those provided to the Fund. In addition, the Board
received data prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent source, showing
the advisory fees and expense ratios of the Fund as compared to the advisory
fees and expense ratios of a peer group selected by Lipper and similar data for
a separate peer group selected by the Advisor. The Board also received advisory
fee and expense ratio data for a peer group of funds compiled by Morningstar
Associates, LLC ("Morningstar"), an independent source. The Board noted that the
Lipper, Advisor and Morningstar peer groups included only three overlapping peer
funds. The Board discussed with representatives of the Advisor the limitations
in creating a relevant peer group for the Fund, including that (i) the Fund is
unique in its composition, which makes assembling peers with similar strategies
and asset mix difficult; (ii) peer funds may use different types of leverage
which have different costs associated with them; and (iii) many of the peer
funds are larger than the Fund, which causes the Fund's fixed expenses to be
higher on a percentage basis as compared to the larger peer funds. The Board
took these limitations into account in considering the peer data. In reviewing
the peer data, the Board noted that the Fund's contractual advisory fee was
equal to the median of both the Lipper and Advisor peer groups and below the
median of the Morningstar peer group.

The Board also considered performance information for the Fund, noting that the
performance information included the Fund's quarterly performance report, which
is part of the process that the Board has established for monitoring the Fund's
performance and portfolio risk on an ongoing basis. The Board determined that
this process continues to be effective for reviewing the Fund's performance. In
addition to the Board's ongoing review of performance, the Board also received
data prepared by Lipper comparing the Fund's performance to the Lipper peer
group, as well as to a larger peer universe and to two benchmarks. In reviewing
the Fund's performance as compared to the performance of the Lipper peer group
and Lipper peer universe, the Board took into account the limitations described
above with respect to creating a relevant peer group for the Fund. The Board
also noted that the Advisor's Leveraged Finance Team did not begin managing the
day-to-day investment of the Fund's assets until October 2010. The Board
considered the Fund's dividend yield as of March 30, 2012 and an analysis
prepared by the Advisor on the continued benefits provided by the Fund's
leverage. In addition, the Board compared the Fund's premium/discount over the
past eight quarters to the average and median premium/discount of the Advisor
peer group over the same period, noting that the Fund's premium/discount was
generally indicative of the asset class and market events.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory fees were
reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, extent and quality of
services provided by the Advisor under the Agreement.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and considered whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale
for the benefit of shareholders. The Board noted the Advisor's statement that
economies of scale in providing services to the Fund are not available at
current asset levels. The Board determined that due to the Fund's closed-end
structure, the potential for realization of economies of scale as Fund assets
grow was not a material factor to be considered. The Board also considered the
costs of the services provided and profits realized by the Advisor from serving
as investment advisor to the Fund for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011,
as set forth in the materials provided to the Board. The Board noted the
inherent limitations in the profitability analysis, and concluded that the
Advisor's estimated profitability appeared to be not excessive in light of the
services provided to the Fund. In addition, the Board considered fall-out
benefits described by the Advisor that may be realized from its relationship
with the Fund, including the Advisor's compensation for fund reporting services
pursuant to a separate Fund Reporting Services Agreement.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously determined that the terms
of the Agreement continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of
the Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

                                                                         Page 31

      (b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused

          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the

      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
