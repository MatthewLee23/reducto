             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of  Directors  and  Members of Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy
Hedge Fund, LLC:


In our opinion, the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital,  including the schedule of investments,  and the related  statements of
operations,  of changes in members'  capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of
Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund,  LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2004, and the results of its  operations,  the changes in its members'  capital,
and its cash flows and the financial  highlights for the periods  indicated,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  of these  financial  statements  in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United  States),  which  require  that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  investments  at  March  31,  2004 by
correspondence  with the custodian and the  application of alternative  auditing
procedures, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable  by the  average  of  total  monthly  members'  capital.  The net
investment  loss ratio does not include the incentive  allocation.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

1.   ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
investment  company and which has many of the  features of a private  investment
fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both  "accredited  investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and  "qualified  clients"  under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment  objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an  attractive,  long-term  rate  of  return,  on  an  absolute  as  well  as  a
risk-adjusted  basis,  with low performance  volatility and minimal  correlation
with the equity and fixed income  markets.  The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in 25-50 partnerships and other investment vehicles  ("Portfolio Funds") managed
by  different  investment  managers  and (ii)  construct a  portfolio  employing
various  arbitrage and equity strategies to achieve the risk control benefits of
diversification together with the value of a hedged investment approach.

Columbia Management Advisors,  Inc. (the "Adviser") is the investment adviser to
the Fund.  Prior to April 1, 2004,  the Adviser was an  indirect,  wholly  owned
subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April
1, 2004,  FleetBoston was acquired by Bank of America  ("BOA"),  see Note 8. The
Adviser has retained  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor" or the
"Subadviser")  as subadviser to the Fund.  The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have
been designated as special members (the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

                                                                              10

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's investments are fair valued by the Adviser.  Investments in Portfolio
Funds are generally valued at net asset value, which approximates fair value, as
reported by the  administrators  or investment  managers of the Portfolio Funds.
Such values generally represent the Fund's proportionate share of the net assets
of the Portfolio Funds. Accordingly, the value of investments in Portfolio Funds
is generally  increased by additional  contributions  to the Portfolio Funds and
the Fund's  share of net  earnings  from the  Portfolio  Funds and  decreased by
withdrawals and the Fund's share of net losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values,  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses from  Portfolio  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified
cost basis.

                                                                              11

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Investors") are  individually  required to report on their own tax return their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E.   CASH

At March 31,  2004,  a total of  $1,108,542  in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust  Company,  the Fund's  custodian.  Of that  amount,  $77,303 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

F.   ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING EXPENSES

The Adviser entered into an expense  deferral  agreement (the "Expense  Deferral
Agreement") with the Fund dated December 19, 2002, as amended December 31, 2002,
whereby the Fund,  upon request of the Adviser,  agrees to repay $366,088 to the
Adviser for organizational and initial offering costs advanced by the Adviser on
behalf of the Fund, subject to certain conditions.  Such repayment is contingent
upon the expenses of the Fund (exclusive of brokerage costs, interest,  taxes or
extraordinary expenses and management fees or performance-based fees paid by the
Fund),  including such repayment,  being limited to no more than 0.75% per annum
of  average  members'  capital  of the  Fund.  The  Expense  Deferral  Agreement
terminates  on April 1,  2006,  and the  Fund  has no  obligation  to pay to the
Adviser any  organizational  or initial offering costs still  outstanding to the
Adviser as of that date.  Through  March 31,  2004,  the Adviser  has  requested
repayment of $73,930 of such  expenses,  and is  reflected  on the  statement of
operations as organizational  fees reimbursed to Adviser.  The Adviser agreed to
forego $28,623 of reimbursement of deferred expenses through March 31, 2004.

                                                                              12

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

An incentive  allocation is calculated with respect to each Investor on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Investor's Interest starts immediately  following the preceding Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year; (ii) the next repurchase of all or any portion of such Investor's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund)  allocated to each  Investor's  capital account
for such Incentive Period over (b) the greater of (i) the Investor's Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the balance in the  Investor's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive  Period.  An Investor's  "Loss
Carryforward"  for the initial  Incentive  Period is zero and for each Incentive
Period  thereafter is equal to the Investor's Loss Carryforward as of the end of
the immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased or decreased,  but not
below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between the net losses over
net profits  allocated  to the Investor for the current  Incentive  Period.  The
"Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return an Investor  would receive if its Interest as
of the  beginning  of that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted  appropriately  for any
additional  contributions)  earned a rate of return equal to the  one-year  U.S.
Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar quarter and reset
on the  first  day of each  calendar  quarter.  The  Hurdle  Rate  Amount is not
cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The Hurdle Rate Amount for
June 30,  2003,  September  30,  2003,  December  31, 2003 and March 31, 2004 is
1.137%, 1.038%, 1.036% and 1.195% per annum, respectively. On December 31, 2003,
the Special  Members  received an  incentive  allocation  of  $643,347,  and the
incentive  allocation  that would have been allocated to the Special  Members if
March 31, 2004 were a calendar year-end is $279,252.

                                                                              13

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3.   MANAGEMENT FEE, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER
     (CONTINUED)

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business day of the calendar  year,  the Investor is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Investor during the Incentive  Period prior to such repurchase or  distribution,
and the Investor's  opening capital account balance and Loss  Carryforward as of
the  beginning  of such  Incentive  Period,  will be  allocated  between the two
Interests  in  proportion  to the  portion of the  Investor's  Interest  that is
repurchased or distributed.

Each director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $1,250 for each
meeting attended. Any director or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund. All directors are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)  serves as
administrator  and  accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides
certain accounting,  record keeping, tax and investor related services. The Fund
pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily upon
month-end members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

4.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Investors, in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

                                                                              14

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

4.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Interests  are offered  monthly.  The minimum  initial  investment  is $150,000,
although the Fund (or its designated agent) may waive this minimum. The Fund may
from time to time offer to repurchase  outstanding Interests based on the Fund's
members' capital pursuant to written tenders from Investors.  These  repurchases
are made at such times and on such terms as may be determined  by the Board,  in
its complete and exclusive discretion.  The Board authorized the Fund to conduct
a $25,000,000  tender offer  effective  December 31, 2003. Such tender offer was
executed effective December 31, 2003, with $781,141 in interests being tendered.
As of March 31, 2004, $77,303 of cash was on deposit in a segregated account for
final payment of those interests tendered. In addition, the Board authorized the
Fund to conduct a $25,000,000  tender offer effective June 30, 2004. Such tender
offer  expired at midnight on April 23, 2004 with  approximately  $1,674,000  in
Interests being tendered.

5.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these investments reported by the Fund. For the year ended March
31, 2004,  the Fund had only  invested in such limited  partnership  and limited
liability interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity, the Fund may not be able to fund significant  repurchases.  Investors
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

                                                                              15

5.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

6.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to one  year  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

Aggregate  purchases  of  Portfolio  Funds for the year  ended  March  31,  2004
amounted to $89,400,000,  including  $11,400,000 in purchases of Portfolio Funds
paid in advance of Portfolio Fund  openings.  Portfolio  Fund  investments  sold
during the year ended March 31, 2004 amounted to $2,139,582.

                                                                              16

6.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS (CONTINUED)

The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of
taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Portfolio Funds at the end of each
calendar year,  when the Portfolio  Funds report taxable income to the Fund. For
the  calendar  year 2003,  not all  taxable  income  allocated  to the Fund from
Portfolio Funds is available.

At March 31, 2004, the Fund's  management is unaware of any  significant  issuer
concentrations  in the underlying  Portfolio  Funds.  The Fund's  investments at
March 31, 2004 are  summarized  below based on the  investment  strategy of each
specific Portfolio Fund.

7.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Adviser,  Columbia Funds  Distributor,  Inc.  ("CFD"),  and certain of their
affiliates  (collectively,  "The  Columbia  Group")  have  received  information
requests and subpoenas from various  regulatory and law enforcement  authorities
in  connection  with their  investigations  of late trading and market timing in
mutual funds.  The Columbia  Group has not  uncovered  any  instances  where the
Adviser or CFD were knowingly involved in late trading of mutual fund shares.

                                                                              17

7.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

On February 24, 2004,  the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") filed a
civil  complaint  in the  United  States  District  Court  for the  District  of
Massachusetts  against  the  Adviser and CFD,  alleging  that they had  violated
certain  provisions of the federal  securities  laws in connection  with trading
activity in mutual fund shares. Also on February 24, 2004, the New York Attorney
General  ("NYAG") filed a civil  complaint in New York Supreme Court,  County of
New York  against  the  Adviser  and CFD  alleging  that the Adviser and CFD had
violated  certain New York anti-fraud  statues.  If either the Adviser or CFD is
unsuccessful  in its  defense  of these  proceedings,  it could be  barred  from
serving as an  investment  advisor or  distributor  for any  investment  company
registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (a "registered
investment company"). Such results could prevent the Adviser, CFD or any company
that  is an  affiliated  person  of the  Adviser  and  CFD  from  serving  as an
investment  advisor  or  distributor  for  any  registered  investment  company,
including  your fund.  The Fund has been  informed by the Adviser that, if these
results occur,  they will seek  exemptive  relief from the SEC to permit them to
continue to serve as the Fund's investment  advisor.  There is no assurance that
such  exemptive  relief will be granted.  On March 15, 2004, the Adviser and CFD
entered into  agreements in principle with the SEC Division of  Enforcement  and
NYAG in settlement  of the charges.  Under the  agreements,  the Adviser and CFD
agreed,  inter  alia,  to the  following  conditions:  payment of $70 million in
disgorgement;  payment of $70 million in civil penalties; an order requiring the
Adviser and CFD to cease and desist from violations of the antifraud  provisions
and other provisions of the federal securities laws; governance changes designed
to maintain  the  independence  of the mutual fund boards of trustees and ensure
compliance with securities laws and their fiduciary duties;  and retention of an
independent consultant to review the Adviser's and CFD's compliance policies and
procedures.  The agreement requires the final approval of the SEC. In a separate
agreement  with the NYAG,  the Columbia  Group has agreed to reduce  mutual fund
fees by $80 million over a five-year period.

As a result of these  matters or any  adverse  publicity  or other  developments
resulting from them, there may be increased redemptions or reduced sales of Fund
Interests, which could increase transaction costs or operating expenses, or have
other adverse consequences for the Fund.

8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On April 1, 2004,  FleetBoston,  including the Adviser,  was acquired by Bank of
America.  The merger did not change the way the Fund is managed,  the investment
personnel assigned to manage the Fund or the fees paid by the Fund.

                                                                              18

                           Fund Governance (unaudited)

The Board  oversees  the  general  conduct  of the  Fund's  business.  The Board
exercises the same powers,  authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Fund
as  are  customarily  exercised  by  the  board  of  directors  of a  registered
investment company organized as a corporation. The directors are not required to
contribute  to the  capital of the Fund or to own  Interests.  A majority of the
Board are persons who are not "interested  persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act)
of the Fund (the "Independent Directors"). The Independent Directors perform the
same functions for the Fund as are customarily  exercised by the  non-interested
directors of a registered  investment  company  organized as a corporation.  The
identity  of  the  Board  and  officers  of  the  Fund  and  brief  biographical
information  regarding  each director and officer  during the past five years is
set forth below.

The  directors  and officers of the Fund,  their ages,  addresses  and principal
occupations during the past five years are as follows (the below information was
current as of March 31, 2004):

(e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the "Policy")
which sets forth the procedures  and the conditions  pursuant to which the Audit
Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit (including audit related,
tax and all other) services provided by the registrant's  independent auditor to
the registrant and individual funds (collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all
non-audit  services  provided  by the  registrant's  independent  auditor to the
funds' adviser or a control  affiliate of the adviser,  that relate  directly to
the  funds'  operations  and  financial  reporting  (collectively  "Fund-related
Adviser Services").  A "control affiliate" is an entity controlling,  controlled
by, or under common control with the adviser that provides  ongoing  services to
the  funds,  and the term  "adviser"  is  deemed  to  exclude  any  unaffiliated
sub-adviser whose role is primarily  portfolio  management and is sub-contracted
or overseen by another  investment  adviser.  The adviser and control affiliates
are collectively referred to as "Adviser Entities."

<PAGE>


The Audit  Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case  basis as
potential  services  are  contemplated)  and  general  (pre-determined  list  of
permitted services) pre-approvals. Unless a type of service has received general
pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it
is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The  Policy  does  not  delegate  the  Audit  Committee's   responsibilities  to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration
shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general pre-approval.

These  schedules  will  provide a  description  of each type of service  that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fees
for each  instance of providing  each  service.  This general  pre-approval  and
related  fees  (where  provided)  will  generally  cover a one-year  period (for
example,  from  July 1  through  March  31 of the  following  year).  The  Audit
Committee will review and approve the types of services and review the projected
fees for the next one-year  period and may add to, or subtract from, the list of
general   pre-approved   services  from  time  to  time,   based  on  subsequent
determinations.  This  approval  acknowledges  that the  Audit  Committee  is in
agreement with the specific types of services that the independent  auditor will
be permitted to perform. The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary
at other regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has the
authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate  amount of non-audit  services
provided to an individual fund.

If,  subsequent to general  pre-approval,  a fund, its  investment  adviser or a
control  affiliate  determines  that it would  like to  engage  the  independent
auditor to perform a service that requires pre-approval and that is not included
in the general pre-approval list, the specific  pre-approval  procedure shall be
as follows:

     o   A brief written  request shall be prepared by management  detailing the
         proposed  engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed to
         be performed by the independent auditor;

     o   The request  should be addressed to the Audit  Committee with copies to
         the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;

     o   The Fund  Treasurer  and/or  Director  of Trustee  Administration  will
         arrange  for a  discussion  of the service to be included on the agenda
         for the next regularly  scheduled  Audit  Committee  meeting,  when the
         Committee will discuss the proposed  engagement and approve or deny the
         request.

     o   If the  timing of the  project is  critical  and the  project  needs to
         commence before the next regularly  scheduled meeting,  the Chairperson
         of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of the
         Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine to call
         a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of considering
         the  proposal.  Should  the  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  Committee  be
         unavailable,  any other member of the Audit  Committee  may serve as an
         alternate  for  the  purpose  of  approving  or  denying  the  request.
         Discussion with the  Chairperson  (or alternate,  if necessary) will be
         arranged   by  the  Fund   Treasurer   and/or   Director   of   Trustee
         Administration.  The  independent  auditor  will not  commence any such
         project unless and until specific approval has been given.

<PAGE>


III. CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee  recognizes that there are cases where services  proposed to
be provided by the independent  auditor to the adviser or control affiliates are
not  Fund-related  Adviser  Services  within  the  meaning  of the  Policy,  but
nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's  ongoing  evaluation of the
auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its audit services to the
funds. As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
auditor to provide  audit or non-audit  services  that are not Fund  Services or
Fund-related  Adviser  Services,  were not subject to  pre-approval by the Audit
Committee,  and the projected fees for any such  engagement (or the aggregate of
all such  engagements  during  the  period  covered  by the  Policy)  exceeds  a
pre-determined  threshold  established by the Audit  Committee;  the independent
auditor,  Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee  Administration  will notify
the Audit  Committee not later than its next meeting.  Such  notification  shall
include a general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be
the  recipient  of such  services,  the timing of the  engagement,  the entity's
reasons for selecting the  independent  auditor,  and the projected  fees.  Such
information  will  allow the  Audit  Committee  to  consider  whether  non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject to
Audit  Committee  pre-approval,  are compatible  with  maintaining the auditor's
independence with respect to the Funds.

IV.  REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Fund  Treasurer  or Director of Trustee  Administration  shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular  meetings  regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered,
including:

     o   A general description of the services, and

     o   Actual billed and projected fees, and

     o   The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related  Adviser Services
         were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

In  addition,  the  independent  auditor  shall  report to the  Audit  Committee
annually, and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the
SEC,  all  non-audit  services  provided to  entities in the funds'  "investment
company  complex,"  as defined by SEC rules,  that did not require  pre-approval
under the Policy.

<PAGE>

V.   AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The  Policy  may be  amended  from time to time by the Audit  Committee.  Prompt
notice of any  amendments  will be provided  to the  independent  auditor,  Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee  Administration.  The Policy shall be reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

     (e)(2) This information has been included in items (b)-(d) above.

     (f) Not applicable.

     (g) All non-audit fees billed by the  registrant's  accountant for services
         rendered to the  registrant  for the fiscal  years ended March 31, 2004
         and March 31, 2003 are disclosed in (b)-(d) above.

All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for services  rendered
to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role
is  primarily  portfolio  management  and is  subcontracted  with or overseen by
another investment adviser) and any entity controlling,  controlled by, or under
common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 are also  disclosed
in (b)-(d) above. There were no such fees.

     (h) The  registrant's   Audit  Committee of  the  Board  of  Directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  adviser (not  including any  sub-adviser
         whose role is primarily portfolio  management and is subcontracted with
         or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides  ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved
         pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule 2-01 of  Regulation  S-X, is
         compatible with  maintaining the principal  accountant's  independence.
         The Audit  Committee  determined that the provision of such services is
         compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR

         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an
         annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to

              communications made by a Fund;

         o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

           Each  Covered  Officer  shall  adhere  to a high standard of business
       ethics and shall be  sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
       or apparent conflicts of interest.

II.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

           ADMINISTRATION. The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the
       Funds  (collectively,  the "Board")  shall  designate an individual to be
       primarily  responsible  for the  administration  of the Code  (the  "Code
       Officer").  The  administration  of the Code shall be  supervised  by the
       Columbia  Management Group Compliance  Department.  In the absence of the
       Code Officer,  his or her designee  shall serve as the Code Officer,  but
       only on a temporary basis.

           Each Fund has  designated  a chief legal  officer  (the "Chief  Legal
       Officer")  for purposes of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules
       promulgated  thereunder.  The Chief Legal  Officer of a Fund shall assist
       the Fund's Code Officer in  administration  of this Code. The Chief Legal
       Officer  shall  be  responsible   for  applying  this  Code  to  specific
       situations in which  questions are  presented  under it (in  consultation
       with Fund counsel,  where appropriate) and has the authority to interpret
       this Code in any particular  situation.  However, any waivers sought by a
       Covered  Officer  must be approved by each Audit  Committee  of the Funds
       (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

III.   MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

           OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
       private interest interferes with the interests of, or his/her service to,
       a Fund.  For  example,  a conflict of  interest  would arise if a Covered
       Officer,  or a family member,  receives  improper  personal benefits as a
       result of the Covered Officer's position with a Fund.

           Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships  between
       Covered  Officers  and a Fund and  already  are  subject to  conflict  of
       interest  provisions in the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "Company
       Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers  Act"). For
       example,   Covered  Officers  may  not  individually  engage  in  certain
       transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale  of  securities  or  other
       property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of
       the Fund. A Fund's and its investment  adviser's  compliance programs and
       procedures are designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,  violations
       of those  provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat
       or replace those programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
       of the parameters of this Code.

           Although   typically  not  presenting  an  opportunity  for  improper
       personal  benefit,  conflicts  may arise  from,  or as a result  of,  the
       contractual  relationship  between  a Fund  and its  investment  adviser,
       administrator,  principal  underwriter,  pricing  and  bookkeeping  agent
       and/or  transfer agent (each, a "Service  Provider") of which the Covered
       Officers  are  also  officers  or  employees.  As  a  result,  this  Code
       recognizes that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
       duties  (whether  formally for a Fund or for a Service  Provider,  or for
       both), be involved in establishing  policies and  implementing  decisions
       that will have different  effects on the Service Provider and a Fund. The
       participation  of the Covered  Officers in such activities is inherent in
       the contractual  relationship  between the Fund and the Service  Provider
       and is consistent with the  performance by the Covered  Officers of their
       duties as officers of a Fund. In addition,  it is recognized by the Board
       that the Covered  Officers  may also be officers or  employees  of one or
       more other investment companies covered by this or other codes.

           Other  conflicts  of interest  are covered by the Code,  even if such
       conflicts  of interest are not subject to  provisions  of the Company Act
       and the Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts
       of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that
       these examples are not exhaustive.  The overarching principle is that the
       personal  interest of a Covered  Officer should not be placed  improperly
       before the interest of a Fund.

<PAGE>


           Each Covered Officer must:

         o    not use personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
              influence  investment  decisions or financial  reporting by a Fund
              whereby the Covered  Officer or an immediate  family  member would
              benefit personally to the detriment of a Fund; and

         o    not cause a Fund to take action,  or fail to take action,  for the
              individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer or an immediate
              family member rather than the benefit of the Fund.1

           There are some conflict of interest  situations that must be approved
       by the Code Officer,  after  consultation  with the Chief Legal  Officer.
       Those situations include, but are not limited to,:

         o    service as director on the board of any public or private company;

         o    the receipt  during any 12-month  period of any gifts in excess of
              $100 in the aggregate  from a third party that does or seeks to do
              business with the Funds;

         o    the receipt of any  entertainment  from any  company  with which a
              Fund has current or  prospective  business  dealings,  unless such
              entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
              as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
              of impropriety;

         o    any  material   ownership   interest  in,  or  any  consulting  or
              employment  relationship with, any Fund service  providers,  other
              than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,  administrator
              or any affiliated person thereof;

         o    a direct or indirect material  financial  interest in commissions,
              transaction  charges  or  spreads  paid  by a Fund  for  effecting
              portfolio  transactions  or for selling or redeeming  shares other
              than an interest  arising from the Covered  Officer's  employment,
              such as compensation or equity ownership.

IV.    DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

           Each Covered Officer shall:

         o    be familiar with the disclosure  requirements generally applicable
              to the Funds;

- --------------------------------
1 For purposes of this Code, personal  trading activity  of the Covered Officers
shall be  monitored  in  accordance with  the  Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered  Officer  shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The  term  "immediate  family"  shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<PAGE>


         o    not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts
              about any Fund to  others,  whether  within or  outside  the Fund,
              including to the Fund's trustees or directors and auditors, and to
              governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o    to the extent  appropriate  within his/her area of responsibility,
              consult  with other  officers  and  employees of the Funds and the
              adviser with the goal of promoting full,  fair,  accurate,  timely
              and  understandable  disclosure  in the reports and  documents the
              Funds  file  with,  or  submit  to,  the SEC and in  other  public
              communications made by the Funds; and

         o    promote compliance with the standards and restrictions  imposed by
              applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.     REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

           Each Covered Officer must:

         o    upon adoption of the Code (or after  becoming a Covered  Officer),
              affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has received,  read and
              understands the Code;

         o    annually affirm to the Board  compliance with the  requirements of
              the Code;

         o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of
              the Funds or their  affiliated  persons for  reports of  potential
              violations that are made in good faith;

         o    notify the Chief Legal  Officer and the Code  Officer  promptly if
              he/she knows of any violation of this Code; and

         o    respond to  questionnaires  circulated  periodically in connection
              with the preparation of disclosure documents for the Funds.

           The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities  related to
       this Code.

           The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating
       and enforcing this Code:

         o    The Chief  Legal  Officer  and/or the Code  Officer  will take all
              appropriate action to investigate any potential violation reported
              to him/her;

         o    If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and the Code
              Officer determine that no violation has occurred, the Code Officer
              will notify the person(s) reporting the potential  violation,  and
              no further action is required;

         o    Any matter that the Chief Legal  Officer  and/or the Code  Officer
              determines  may be a  violation  will  be  reported  to the  Audit
              Committee;

         o    If the Audit  Committee  determines that a violation has occurred,
              it will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,  which will
              consider  appropriate  action,  which may  include  review of, and
              appropriate  modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
              notification to the Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management
              Group;  or a  recommendation  to  sanction  or dismiss the Covered
              Officer;

<PAGE>


         o    The Audit  Committee will be responsible  for granting  waivers in
              its sole discretion;

         o    Any  changes  to or  waivers  of this  Code  will,  to the  extent
              required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

           The Chief Legal Officer shall:

         o    report to the Audit Committee  quarterly any approvals provided in
              accordance with Section III of this Code; and

         o    report to the Audit  Committee  quarterly  any  violations  of, or
              material issues arising under, this Code.


VI.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

           This Code  shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the Funds for
       the purposes of Section 406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the rules and
       forms applicable to registered investment companies  thereunder.  Insofar
       as  other  polices  or  procedures  of the  Funds or the  Funds'  Service
       Providers  govern  or  purport  to  govern  the  behavior  or  activities
       (including,  but not  limited to,  personal  trading  activities)  of the
       Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are  superseded  by
       this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions
       of this Code.  The Funds' and their  investment  advisers'  and principal
       underwriter's  codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and
       any  policies  and  procedures  of the  Service  Providers  are  separate
       requirements  applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this
       Code.

VII.   AMENDMENTS

           All material  amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by
       the Board, including a majority of independent directors or trustees.

VIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

           All reports and records prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code
       will be considered  confidential  and shall be  maintained  and protected
       accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required  by law or this  Code,  such
       matters  shall not be  disclosed  to anyone  other  than the  Board,  the
       Covered  Officers,  the Chief Legal  Officer,  the Code Officer,  outside
       audit  firms and legal  counsel to the Funds,  and senior  management  of
       Columbia Management Group.

IX.    INTERNAL USE

           The Code is  intended  solely for the  internal  use by the Funds and
       does not constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any
       fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.
