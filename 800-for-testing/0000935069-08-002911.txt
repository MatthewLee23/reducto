NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   ORGANIZATION

     Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
     (the "Company") was organized as a Delaware  Limited  Liability  Company on
     August 16, 2002. The Company is registered under the Investment Company Act
     of 1940 (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified
     management  investment company.  Shares of the Company are registered under
     the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").

     The investment  objective of the Company is to achieve capital appreciation
     principally  through  investing in investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")
     managed by third-party  investment  managers  ("Investment  Managers") that
     employ a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
     strategies  allow  Investment  Managers the  flexibility to use leverage or
     short-side positions to take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies  across
     the global markets, often referred to as "alternative" strategies.  Because
     Investment  Funds  following  alternative  investment  strategies are often
     described  as hedge  funds,  the  investment  program of the Company can be
     described as a fund of hedge funds.

     Shares  of the  Company  are sold to  eligible  investors  (referred  to as
     "Shareholders").  The minimum  initial  investment in the Company from each
     Shareholder is $25,000 (and was $50,000 from January 1, 2003 to November 1,
     2003); the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

     Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC ("CAI" or the "Adviser"),  a Delaware
     limited  liability  company and an  indirect,  wholly owned  subsidiary  of
     Citigroup Inc., serves as the Company's  investment adviser. The Adviser is
     registered as an investment  adviser under the  Investment  Advisers Act of
     1940,  as  amended,  and,  among  other  things,  is  responsible  for  the
     allocation of the Company's assets to various  Investment Funds.  Under the
     Company's governing documents,  the Company has delegated substantially all
     authority to oversee the  management  of the  operations  and assets of the
     Company to the Board of Directors.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms of the respective
     limited  partnership  agreements,  limited  liability  company  agreements,
     offering   memoranda   and  such   negotiated   "side  letter"  or  similar
     arrangements  as the Adviser may have entered into with the Investment Fund
     on behalf of the  Company.  The Company  values these  investments  at fair
     value based on financial data supplied by the Investment Funds.

     a.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The net  asset  value  of the  Company  is  determined  as of the  close of
     business  at the  end of  each  month  in  accordance  with  the  valuation
     principles  set  forth  below  or as may be  determined  from  time to time
     pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company's  investments in Investment Funds are carried at fair value as
     determined  by the  Company's  pro-rata  interest in the net assets of each
     Investment Fund. All valuations utilize financial  information  supplied by
     each Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
     fees or other  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers as
     required by the Investment Funds'  agreements.  Each Investment  Manager to
     which the Adviser allocates assets will charge the Company,  as an investor
     in an underlying  Investment  Fund, an asset-based  fee, and some or all of
     the Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
     form of an incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers
     are  generally  expected  to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets
     under their management and the incentive fee is generally expected to range
     from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

     The  Company  may invest in  Investment  Funds that may  designate  certain
     investments  within  those  Investment  Funds,  typically  those  that  are
     especially  illiquid  and/or hard to value, as "special  situation"  (often
     called "Side-Pocket")  investments with additional redemption  limitations.
     Such a  Side-Pocket  is, in effect,  similar to a private  equity fund that
     requires its investors to remain  invested for the duration of the fund and
     distributes returns on the investment only when liquid assets are generated
     within the fund,  typically  through the sale of the fund's illiquid assets
     in exchange for cash.

     As a general  matter,  the fair  value of the  Company's  investment  in an
     Investment  Fund  represents  the amount that the  Company  can  reasonably
     expect to receive from an Investment Fund if the Company's  investment were
     redeemed at the time of valuation,  based on  information  available at the
     time. The Investment  Funds provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
     monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require advance notice of a
     Shareholder's  intent to redeem its  interest,  and may,  depending  on the
     Investment Funds' governing agreements, deny or delay a redemption request.
     The  Company  generally  does not factor  into its  valuation  a  liquidity
     discount on any Investment  Funds held.  However,  when an Investment  Fund
     imposes  extraordinary  restrictions on redemptions or when there have been
     no recent  transactions in the Investment  Fund interests,  the Company may
     determine  that it is  appropriate  to  apply  such a  discount.  Any  such
     decision  would  be made in good  faith,  and  subject  to the  review  and
     supervision of the Board of Directors.  The underlying  investments of each
     Investment  Fund  are  accounted  for at fair  value as  described  in each
     Investment Fund's financial  statements.  The Investment Funds may invest a
     portion of their assets in restricted securities and other investments that
     are illiquid.

     The valuations reported by the Investment Managers,  upon which the Company
     calculates its month-end net asset value and net asset value per Share, may
     be subject to later adjustment,  based on information  reasonably available
     at that time. For example,  fiscal year-end net asset value calculations of
     the  Investment  Funds are audited by those Funds'  independent  registered
     public  accountants  and may be revised as a result of such  audits.  Other
     adjustments  may occur from time to time.  Such  adjustments  or revisions,
     irrespective  of their size and whether  increasing or  decreasing  the net
     asset value of the Company at the time they occur,  because  they relate to
     information available only at the time of the adjustment or revision,  will
     not affect the amount of the repurchase  proceeds  received by Shareholders
     who had their Shares  repurchased  prior to such  adjustments  and received
     their repurchase proceeds.

     As a result, to the extent that such subsequently  adjusted valuations from
     the  Investment  Managers or revisions to net asset value of an  Investment
     Fund adversely affect the Company's net asset value, the outstanding Shares
     of the  Company  will  be  adversely  affected  by such  prior  repurchases
     redeemed at a net asset value per Share higher than the adjusted amount.

     Conversely,  any increases in the net asset value per Share  resulting from
     such subsequently  adjusted  valuations will be entirely for the benefit of
     the holders of the  outstanding  Shares of the Company and to the detriment
     of Shareholders who previously had their Shares  repurchased at a net asset
     value per Share lower than the adjusted  amount.  New  Shareholders  may be
     affected  in a  similar  way,  because  the  same  principles  apply to the
     purchase of Shares.  Unlike a pricing  adjustment  based on an audit or new
     information,  a  pricing  "error,"  such as an  administrative  mistake  in
     processing  or the  misapplication  by the  Company  or its  agents  of the
     valuation principles described in the Company's procedures, would require a
     retroactive   adjustment,   provided  such  an  adjustment  is  deemed  (in
     accordance with applicable  regulatory  guidance and upon consultation with
     the Company's auditors and/or counsel) to be material. Any such retroactive
     adjustment shall be reported promptly to the Company's Valuation Committee.

     b.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

     Interest  income is recorded on the accrual  basis.  Income,  expenses  and
     realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded  monthly.  The change
     in an  Investment  Fund's  net asset  value is  included  in net  change in
     unrealized appreciation on investments on the Statement of Operations.  The
     Company records realized gain or loss on its investment in Investment Funds
     only to the extent that cost of such  investment as well as any Side Pocket
     has been fully recovered  through  previous  redemptions from investment in
     Investment Funds.

     The Company  bears all expenses  incurred in the course of its  operations,
     including,  but not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses
     related to portfolio  transactions and positions for the Company's account;
     professional fees; costs of insurance;  registration expenses; and expenses
     of meetings of the Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with
     the initial  offering  were  deferred and  amortized  over the first twelve
     months of  operations;  costs  incurred in  connection  with the  Company's
     subsequent registration of its shares under the 1933 Act have been deferred
     and were  amortized over the twelve months  commencing  after the effective
     date of such registration.

     c.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company operated as a partnership from inception  through September 30,
     2005. As of October 1, 2005, the Company became a corporation that is taxed
     as a regulated investment company.

     It is the  Company's  intention  to meet the  requirements  of the Internal
     Revenue  Code  applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  (RIC)  and
     distribute  substantially  all of its  taxable  net  investment  income and
     capital gains, if any, to Shareholders each year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Therefore,  no federal income or excise tax provision is typically required
     for the  Company's  financial  statements.  While the  Company  intends  to
     distribute  substantially  all of its  taxable  net  investment  income and
     capital gains, in the manner necessary to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
     tax as  described  above,  it is  possible  that  some  excise  tax will be
     incurred. In such event, the Company will be liable for the tax only on the
     amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirements.

     During the current year, the Company  adopted FASB  Interpretation  No. 48,
     ACCOUNTING  FOR  UNCERTAINTY  IN INCOME  TAXES ("FIN 48").  FIN 48 provides
     guidance for how uncertain tax positions  should be  recognized,  measured,
     presented and disclosed in the  financial  statements.  FIN 48 requires the
     evaluation of tax positions  taken or expected to be taken in the course of
     preparing the Company's  financial  statements to determine whether the tax
     positions are  "more-likely-than-not"  of being sustained by the applicable
     tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the  "more-likely-than-not"
     threshold  would be  recorded  as a tax  benefit or expense in the  current
     year. The Adviser has concluded the adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the
     operations  of the Company for the six months ended  September 30, 2008 and
     that no  provision  for income tax is required in the  Company's  financial
     statements.

     The Company's  federal and state income and federal  excise tax returns for
     which the applicable statute of limitations have not expired are subject to
     examination  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service  and state  departments  of
     revenue.

     d.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and monies invested in
     money market  deposit  accounts that are  accounted for at amortized  cost,
     which approximates fair value.

     e.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires management of the Company to make
     estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
     statements and accompanying  notes.  Management believes that the estimates
     utilized in preparing the Company's financial statements are reasonable and
     prudent; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

     In September 2006, the Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 157
     - Fair Value Measurements - ("SFAS  157"), was issued and is effective  for
     fiscal years  beginning  after  November  15,  2007.  SFAS 157 defines fair
     value,  establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value and  expands
     disclosures  about fair value  measurements.  SFAS 157 requires  disclosure
     surrounding  the various inputs that are used in  determining  the value of
     the Company's investments. These inputs are summarized into the three broad
     levels listed below.

     --   Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
     --   Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
                    for similar securities,  interest rates,  prepayment speeds,
                    credit risk, etc.)
     --   Level 3 - Significant  unobservable  inputs  (including the Fund's own
                    assumptions in determining  the fair value of  investments).
                    The notion of  unobservable  inputs is intended to allow for
                    situations in which there is little, if any, market activity
                    for the asset or liability at the  measurement  date.  Under
                    Level 3, the  owner of an  asset  must  determine  valuation
                    based on its own assumptions about what market  participants
                    would take into  account in  pricing  the asset,  using best
                    information available.

     The inputs or methodology  used for valuing  securities are not necessarily
     an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

     The  following is a summary of the inputs used as of September 30, 2008, in
     valuing the Company's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

     SFAS 157 also  requires a  reconciliation  of assets for which  significant
     unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value:

4.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In  March  2008,  the  FASB  released  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
     Standards No. 161,  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
     ACTIVITIES  ("FAS 161").  FAS 161 requires  qualitative  disclosures  about
     objectives and strategies for using derivatives,  quantitative  disclosures
     about fair value  amounts and gains and losses on  derivative  instruments,
     and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
     agreements.  The adoption of FAS 161 is required for fiscal years beginning
     after November 15, 2008 and interim  periods within those fiscal years.  At
     this time,  the Company has not yet adopted FAS 161 and is  evaluating  the
     implications of FAS 161 and its impact on the financial  statements has not
     yet been determined.

5.   MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

     The Adviser provides certain management and administrative  services to the
     Company.  The Adviser  acts  primarily  to evaluate  and select  Investment
     Managers,  to  allocate  assets,  to  establish  and apply risk  management
     procedures, and to monitor overall investment performance. In addition, the
     Adviser  also  provides  office  space  and  other  support  services.   In
     consideration for such services, the Company will pay the Adviser a monthly
     management fee based on end of month Shareholder's capital.

     Effective  August 1, 2005,  the Board of Directors  approved a reduction in
     the management fee to 1.5% of net assets annually (from 2.25% annually).

     In addition, the Adviser allocated certain marketing fees of $29,418 to the
     Company during the six months ended September 30, 2008.

     Placement  agents may be retained by the Company to assist in the placement
     of Fund Shares.  A placement  agent will generally be entitled to receive a
     fee from each investor in the Company  whose shares the agent  places.  The
     specific  amount of the placement fee paid with respect to a Shareholder is
     generally dependent on the size of the investment in the Company.

     Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a wholly
     owned  subsidiary of  Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement  agent of the
     Company  Shares.  For the six months ended  September 30, 2008, the Company
     paid $1,018,670 in placement fees to CGM on the Company  Shares.  Such fees
     are deducted from an investor's gross contribution amount.

     The  Company  has  entered  into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
     additional  placement  agents for the Company  Shares.  Placement  fees may
     range from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser,  and/or its affiliates,  will
     pay the placement agents an annual fee, payable monthly in arrears. The fee
     shall  be  paid  from  the   Adviser's  own  resources  (or  those  of  its
     affiliates).

     Prior to  October  1, 2005 the  Company  paid CAI a  monthly  fee of 0.025%
     (0.30% on an annualized  basis) for  administration  based  primarily  upon
     average  net  assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly  fee,  and  reimbursed
     certain expenses.

     CAI,  as  Administrator,  retained  PNC Global  Investment  Servicing  Inc.
     ("PNCGIS"),  an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of the
     PNC  Financial  Services  Group,  to  assist  in  the  performance  of  its
     administrative duties.

     On October 1, 2005 a restructuring of this  arrangement took effect.  Under
     the new  arrangement  CAI and  PNCGIS  have  separate  agreements  with the
     Company   and  act  as   co-administrators   to  the   Company.   CAI,   as
     co-administrator, no longer receives a monthly fee for their administrative
     services to the Company.  PNCGIS  continues to provide certain  accounting,
     recordkeeping,  tax and investor related services.  Fees for their services
     are charged directly to the Company.

     Effective January 1, 2008, each Director who is not an "interested  person"
     of the Company,  as defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of
     $20,000  plus a Board of  Directors  meeting  fee of $1,000 and a telephone
     meeting  fee of $500.  The  Chairman  of the Audit  Committee  receives  an
     additional  fee of $3,000  per year.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
     person"  does not  receive  any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All
     Directors are reimbursed for all reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
     amounts  expensed  related to  Directors  by the Company for the six months
     ended September 30, 2008 were $31,500.

     PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PNCGIS)  serves as  custodian of the
     Company's  assets and provides  custodial  services  for the Company.  Fees
     payable to the custodian and reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by
     the  Company.  Total  amounts  expensed  related to  custodian  fees by the
     Company for the six months ended September 30, 2008 were $16,729.

6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     The following  table lists the aggregate  purchases and proceeds from sales
     of  Investment  Funds for the six months  ended  September  30,  2008,  net
     unrealized   appreciation,   gross  unrealized   appreciation,   and  gross
     unrealized depreciation as of September 30, 2008.

7.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

     Generally,  initial and additional subscriptions for Shares may be accepted
     as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by the Board of
     Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any  initial  and  additional
     subscriptions  for Shares in the Company.  The Board of Directors from time
     to time and in its  complete and  exclusive  discretion,  may  determine to
     cause the  Company to  repurchase  Shares  from  Shareholders  pursuant  to
     written  tenders by  Shareholders  on such terms and  conditions  as it may
     determine.  CAI expects  that it typically  will  recommend to the Board of
     Directors  that the Company  offer to repurchase  Shares from  Shareholders
     quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or, if
     any such date is not a business day, on the immediately  preceding business
     day).

     Transactions  in Shares were as follows the six months ended  September 30,
     2008 and the year ended March 31, 2008:

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Company
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not limited to, short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts and
     entering into equity swaps.  The Company's risk of loss in these investment
     funds is limited to the value of it's investment in such funds.

9.   LOAN PAYABLE

     On December  27,  2006,  the  Company  entered  into a Credit and  Security
     Agreement with an  unaffiliated  bank for a $125,000,000  revolving  credit
     facility  (the  "Credit  Facility").  The Credit  Facility  will be used in
     connection with investment  activities,  for cash management  purposes,  to
     fund the  repurchase  of shares or for  temporary or emergency  purposes as
     permitted under the Offering Memorandum.  The Credit Facility is secured by
     the Company's assets. At September 30, 2008, the outstanding borrowing from
     the Credit Facility amounted to $81,900,000,  bearing interest at a rate of
     4.00%  less a  discount  percentage  per  annum.  Interest  expense  on the
     outstanding  borrowing  for the six months  ended  September  30,  2008 was
     $981,591 with $702,222  payable at September 30, 2008. The Credit  Facility
     is scheduled to mature on December 27, 2008.  While the Company  intends to
     enter into a new Credit and  Securities  Agreement,  there is no  guarantee
     that the Company will be successful in securing a new facility.

                                   (UNAUDITED)

     The  Company's  officers  are  appointed by the  Directors  and oversee the
management of the day-to-day  operations of the Company under the supervision of

*    Term of office of each officer is indefinite.



     In addition to their roles as Independent Directors of the Company, each of
Steven  Krull  and  Josh  Weinreich  serve  on  special  independent  committees
representing other clients of the Adviser. The committee engagements and related
compensation  are  described  below.  These  matters  have been  reviewed by the
Company's  Board  of  Directors,  which  determined  that  the  engagements  are
appropriate for Independent Directors of the Company.

     Mr. Krull serves on the Advisory  Committee  for the  Adviser's  HedgeForum
business.  HedgeForum is a program under which  third-party  private  investment
funds  are  diligenced  by the  Adviser  and  then  made  available  for  direct
investment by sophisticated  investors. Mr. Krull is one of three members of the
HedgeForum  Advisory  Committee (all committee members are unaffiliated with the
Adviser)  and  receives  for his  services an annual  retainer  of $12,000  plus
certain meeting fees and reimbursements for out of pocket expenses.  For the six
months ended  September 30 2008, Mr. Krull received  $12,000 in connection  with
this  engagement.  All such costs are borne by the third-party  investment funds
participating in the HedgeForum offering.
