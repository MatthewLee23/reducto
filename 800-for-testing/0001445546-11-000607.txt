                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (formerly known as First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II) (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and its representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no
obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to
reflect events and circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

                                   COMMENTARY

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may
not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

The six-month reporting period ending November 30, 2010 began on a negative
note, as investors grappled with potential sovereign risk in Europe,
particularly Greece, which led to a flight to quality. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged
Loan Index ("Index") declined -0.44% in the month of June, reflecting these
worries. However, since June, the Index has posted positive results in each
month, which led to a 4.81% total return for the Index for the six-month
reporting period covered by this report.

The positive returns in the Senior Loan market were supported by two factors:
improving credit quality and a supportive technical backdrop. From a fundamental
credit standpoint, the default rate has steadily moved lower throughout the
period. At the end of May, the trailing twelve-month default rate stood at 4.64%
and has declined steadily to end November at 2.25%. Investor confidence has
increased as the default environment improved, which has resulted in higher
average loan prices. As one might expect in a declining default environment,


                                                                          Page 3

corporate performance has improved. In both the second and third calendar
quarters this year, companies that file publicly within the Index have
experienced both revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes
depreciation and amortization, which is a measure of a company's cash flow)
growth over the same periods one year ago. Improving corporate performance and
declining default rates have benefited the Senior Loan market over the period.

The technical backdrop in the Senior Loan market has benefited loan prices over
the past six months. The Senior Loan market has been increasingly active over
the reporting period. The demand for Senior Loans has increased along with new
issue supply. Over the calendar year to date period, the Senior Loan market has
seen $91 billion in net new loan issuance compared to $130 billion in potential
demand (driven by prepayments in the market and new inflows into retail Senior
Loan funds). The strong demand for Senior Loans has allowed the secondary market
prices of loans to trend higher, from approximately 90.4 cents on the dollar at
the beginning of the period to 92.8 cents on the dollar at November month end.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

For the six-month period ending November 30, 2010, the Fund generated a market
price total return1 of 10.56% and a net asset value (NAV) total return1 of
6.06%. The Fund's market price return benefited in the period as the discount to
NAV narrowed from -9.38% at the beginning of the period to -5.53% at the end of
the reporting period.

The Fund paid six income distributions in the six months covered by this report
for a total distribution of $0.309 per common share. This period's income
distributions compare favorability to the $0.21 per common share that was paid
in the prior six-month period (December 1, 2009 - May 31, 2010). During the
current reporting period, the Fund increased the monthly income distribution two
times. The increased income distributions reflect both a higher level of LIBOR
(London Interbank Offered Rate), and an increase in coupons in the Senior Loan
market. At the end of November 2010, the Funds distribution yield at NAV was
4.56% (4.83% at market price).

The Fund's NAV return for the period outperformed its benchmark index, the
S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index return of 4.81% by 125 basis points, but lagged
the peer group median return of 6.86% by 80 basis points. The Fund's higher
credit quality portfolio construction relative to the peer group detracted from
returns in the period. For the six months ending November 30, 2010, lower
quality B rated loans within the Index returned +6.31%, outperforming higher
credit quality BB rated loans, which returned +4.54%.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

As seasoned managers, we have been working diligently to capitalize on the
current market opportunities by performing rigorous credit research and by
seeking to identify what we believe to be excellent risk-adjusted return
opportunities. In accordance with the stated objectives in the Fund's
prospectus, we are focused on credit quality and improving yield. Our portfolio
strategy is to balance the goal of high current income with portfolio risk.
While we expect the Fund to continue to be of high credit quality, we believe
there are some compelling opportunities in the market today that may marginally
reduce the overall portfolio's weighted average credit rating, but which we
believe will improve the portfolio yield and ultimately enhance the risk/reward
profile of the portfolio. We expect that even with these potential enhancements,
the credit quality of the Fund's portfolio would continue to be superior to that
of its benchmark index and many peer funds within the Senior Loan closed-end
fund category. In providing a competitive rate of income to shareholders, we
will focus our attention on those issues that provide the greatest relative
value, or risk-adjusted return.

The First Trust Leveraged Finance Investment Team remains optimistic about the
outlook for the Senior Loan market. With loan prices trading, on average, below
par, defaults trending lower, and credit quality generally strong, we believe
investors with an intermediate time horizon will be rewarded by investing in the
Senior Loan asset class as current market conditions appear to offer investors a
compelling value. Moreover, should interest rates begin to increase in the
future, we anticipate that the Fund will benefit given the floating-rate nature
of the Senior Loan assets.

       the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in NAV per share for net asset
       value returns and changes in Common Share price for market value returns.
       Total returns do not reflect sales load and are not annualized for

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (formerly known as First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II) (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans")1. There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:
The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily in accordance with valuation procedures
adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with provisions of
the 1940 Act. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and
sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service.

Common stocks and other securities listed on any national or foreign exchange
(excluding the NASDAQ National Market ("NASDAQ") and the London Stock Exchange
Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")), are valued at the last sale price on the
exchange on which they are principally traded. If there are no transactions on
the valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent
bid and asked prices. Securities listed on the NASDAQ or the AIM are valued at
the official closing price. If there is no official closing price on the
valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent bid
and asked prices. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at
their closing bid prices.

Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when purchased
are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.

In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation, or the valuations received are deemed
unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities.
Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal markets for
certain securities (e.g., domestic debt securities and foreign securities) that
could materially affect the Fund's NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method
to value the Fund's securities. The use of fair value pricing is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act. As a general principle, the fair value of a
security is the amount which the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the
security upon its current sale. However, in light of the judgment involved in
fair valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair value assigned to a
particular security will be the amount which the Fund might be able to receive
upon its current sale. Fair valuation of a security is based on the
consideration of all available information, including, but not limited to, the
following:

   Statements includes Senior Loans.


                                                                         Page 23

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the issuer;

      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;

      3)    the type, size and cost of the security;

      4)    the financial statements of the issuer;

      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the issuer, based on the
            Advisor's or external analysis;

      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;

      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the issuer/borrower, or comparable companies;

      8)    the coupon payments;

      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;

      10)   the business prospects of the issuer, including any ability to
            obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the issuer's management;

      11)   the prospects for the issuer's industry, and multiples (of earnings
            and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in that
            industry; and

      12)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

         o Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
           identical securities. An active market is a market in which
           transactions for the security occur with sufficient frequency and
           volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

         o Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
           indirectly, and include the following:
            -     Quoted prices for similar securities in active markets.
            -     Quoted prices for identical or similar securities in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the security, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.
            -     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  security (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).
            -     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.
         o Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs
           may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
           assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
           security.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing portfolio investments are not
necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those
investments. A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's portfolio
investments as of November 30, 2010 is included with the Fund's Portfolio of
Investments.

B. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:
The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
investments, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying investments during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Advisor reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness
of those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements
to evaluate potential risks. As of November 30, 2010, the Fund had no open
repurchase agreements.

C. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:
Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued or delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments.

D. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:
The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund did not have unfunded delayed draw loan
commitments as of November 30, 2010.

                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


E. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:
The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
November 30, 2010, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. These securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as
stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a
discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There
are no unrestricted investments with the same maturity dates and yields for
these issuers.

</TABLE>

(1) Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on
    July 31, 2007.

F. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:
The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions
made by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2010 is as follows:


Distributions paid from:
Ordinary income............................... $     11,164,283

As of May 31, 2010, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income.................$         210,967
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)....      (20,822,124)
Accumulated capital and other losses..........     (106,617,974)

G. INCOME TAXES:
The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry realized capital losses forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. The
Fund is subject to certain limitations under U.S. tax rules on the use of
capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These limitations
apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership. At May 31, 2010, the Fund
had a capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of $100,873,038,
with $3,984,460, $3,611,723, $25,585,953 and $67,690,902 expiring on May 31,
2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Certain losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2010, the Fund intends to elect to defer net realized losses
incurred between November 1, 2009 and May 31, 2010 of $5,744,936.

The Fund is subject to tax accounting standards that establish a minimum
threshold for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending
2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31,
2010, management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund,
and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's
financial statements for uncertain tax positions.

H. EXPENSES:
The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

                                                                         Page 25

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


I. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT:
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06 "Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements." ASU 2010-06 amends FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to require
additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Certain disclosures
required by ASU No. 2010-06 are effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2009, and other required disclosures are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact
ASU No. 2010-06 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures, if any.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of
the Fund's investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and
providing certain administrative services necessary for the management of the
Fund. For these investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a
monthly fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets
(the average daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's
liabilities other than the principal amount of borrowings).

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners") served as the Fund's
investment sub-advisor and managed the Fund's portfolio subject to First Trust's
supervision until October 12, 2010. Four Corners received an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that was paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

James A. Bowen, the President of First Trust, on October 12, 2010, acquired 100%
of the voting stock of The Charger Corporation, the general partner of First
Trust (the "Transaction"). The consummation of the Transaction was deemed to be
an "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's investment management
agreement and investment sub-advisory agreement and resulted in the automatic
termination of the agreements. The Transaction is not expected to impact the
day-to-day operations of the Fund.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund approved an interim investment management
agreement with First Trust which was entered into effective upon the closing of
the Transaction and would be in effect for a maximum period of 150 days absent
shareholder approval. A new investment management agreement with First Trust has
been approved by the Board of Trustees of the Fund and was submitted to
shareholders of the Fund as of the record date (September 30, 2010) for approval
to take effect upon such shareholder approval. An annual shareholder meeting of
the Fund to vote on a proposal to approve the new investment management
agreement was held on December 20, 2010, at which time the new investment
management agreement was approved by the Fund's shareholders. Until December 20,
2010, advisory fees payable to First Trust were held in escrow. See Submission
of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders, in the Additional Information section of
this report, for the results.

Also, effective October 12, 2010, the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust assumed the day-to-day responsibility for management of the Fund's
portfolio. As a result, no interim sub-advisory agreement with the sub-advisor
was entered into for the Fund. Additionally, effective October 12, 2010, the
Fund's name was changed from First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate
Income Fund II to ''First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II,'' and the
Fund continues to trade under the same ticker symbol ''FCT.''

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (formerly PNC Global Investment
Servicing (U.S.) Inc.) serves as the Fund's Administrator, Fund Accountant and
Transfer Agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company,
which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company effective
July 1, 2011, serves as the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee
arrangements.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustee") is paid an annual retainer of
$10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and an
annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust in the First Trust
Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of the trusts.
No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with board or committee
meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $5,000 annually, and each of the
Chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Valuation Committee
is paid $2,500 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation paid
by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those trusts.
Trustees are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead
Independent Trustee and each Committee chairman will serve two-year terms before
rotating to serve as chairman of another committee or as Lead Independent
Trustee. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from the
Fund for serving in such capacities.

                     4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2010 were $142,973,494 and
$132,974,224, respectively.

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May 11,
2011 and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured
line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made
to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after
any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of
the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility is $160,000,000. For the six months ended November 30, 2010, the
average amount outstanding was $148,415,301. The loans under the Credit Facility
funded by CRC Funding, LLC (the "Conduit Lender") bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
Conduit Lender. The loans under the Credit Facility funded by Citibank, N.A.
(the "Secondary Lender") bear interest for each settlement period at a per annum
rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the settlement period plus 3.25% or
(ii) the alternate base rate plus 3.25%. For the six months ended November 30,
2010, the Fund had no loans under the Credit Facility funded by the Secondary
Lender. The high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the Credit
Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during the six months ended November 30,
2010, were 0.46% and 0.27%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate
of 0.37%. The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at November 30, 2010
was 0.27%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which included a
program fee of 0.50% and a liquidity fee of 0.50% per year. Prior to October 12,
2010, the liquidity fee was a per annum rate of 0.35%. On May 13, 2010, the Fund
extended the expiration date of the Credit Facility for another year and paid
upfront closing fees of $400,000. Such fees are amortized over one-year periods
and are included with the other borrowing costs in "Interest and fees on loan"
on the Statement of Operations.

                             6. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor determines that it is temporarily
unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is impractical to do
so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and trading in the
investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take temporary
defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its


                                                                         Page 27

subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On December 20, 2010, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0600 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on January 5, 2011, payable January 14, 2011.

On January 20, 2011, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0650 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on February 3, 2011, payable February 15, 2011.

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

          (1)    If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value
                 ("NAV") at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
                 shares at a price equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common
                 Share on that date or (ii) 95% of the market price on that
                 date.

          (2)    If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of
                 valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
                 distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the
                 open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants'
                 accounts. It is possible that the market price for the Common
                 Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
                 purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid
                 by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of
                 valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if
                 the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
                 issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
                 distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the
                 open market within 30 days of the valuation date except where
                 temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary
                 to comply with federal securities laws. Interest will not be
                 paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS

The Annual Shareholder Meeting for the Fund was held on December 6, 2010 (the
"meeting"). At the meeting, Trustee James A. Bowen was elected a Class III
Trustee for a three-year term expiring at the Fund's annual meeting of
shareholders in 2013. In addition, Trustees Thomas R. Kadlec and Robert F. Keith
(previously elected as "Preferred Trustees" at the 2009 annual meeting of
shareholders of the Fund) were elected as "Common Share Trustees." Thomas R.
Kadlec was elected a Class I Trustee for a one-year term expiring at the Fund's
annual meeting of shareholders in 2011, and Robert F. Keith was elected a Class
III Trustee serving a three-year term expiring at the Fund's annual meeting of
shareholders in 2013. The number of votes cast in favor of Mr. Bowen was
13,360,934 and the number of abstentions was 1,394,726. The number of votes cast
in favor of Mr. Keith was 13,362,646 and the number of abstentions was
1,393,014. The number of votes cast in favor of Mr. Kadlec was 13,364,342 and
the number of abstentions was 1,391,318.

The annual meeting was continued to December 20, 2010, at which time
shareholders approved a new Investment Management Agreement for the Fund. The
number of votes cast in favor of the New Investment Management Agreement was
10,116,685, the number of votes against was 763,734, and the number of
abstentions was 371,087. The terms of the New Investment Management Agreement
are substantially similar to the terms of previous agreements.

                        INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS

Board Consideration Regarding Continuation of Investment Management Agreements

The Board of Trustees of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, approved the Interim
Investment Management Agreement and the New Investment Management Agreement
(collectively, the "Agreements") between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P.
(the "Advisor"), at a meeting held on September 20, 2010. The Board determined
that the terms of the Agreements are fair and reasonable and that the Agreements
are in the best interests of the Fund. The Board also determined that it
believes that the scope and quality of services to be provided to the Fund under
the Agreements will be at least equivalent to the scope and quality of services
provided under the current Investment Management Agreement with the Advisor (the
"Original Investment Management Agreement") and the current Investment
Sub-Advisory Agreement among the Fund, the Advisor and Four Corners Capital
Management, LLC (the "Sub-Advisor") (collectively, the "Original Agreements").

On August 25, 2010, the Independent Trustees were informed that James A. Bowen,
the President of the Advisor and a Trustee and Chairman of the Board of the
Fund, had entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the common stock of The
Charger Corporation, the general partner of the Advisor (the "Transaction"), the
consummation of which would constitute a "change of control" of the Advisor and
would result in the "assignment" and termination of the current Investment
Management Agreement and may also result in the "assignment" and termination of
the current Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement pursuant to their terms and in
accordance with Section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "1940 Act"). On August 31, 2010, counsel to the Independent Trustees
forwarded to Mr. Bowen and the Advisor a request for information regarding the
Transaction. Subsequent to August 31, 2010, the Advisor provided the Board with
a written proposal to transition portfolio management for the Fund from the
Sub-Advisor to the Advisor's Leveraged Finance Team. The Advisor informed the
Board that if the portfolio management transition for the Fund was approved, the
Advisor would not seek approval for a new Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement
following the termination of the current Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement upon
the consummation of the Transaction. In anticipation of the consummation of the
Transaction, the Board at its meeting held on September 20, 2010, considered (1)
the information provided by Mr. Bowen and the Advisor in response to the
Independent Trustees' request for information, (2) information regarding Fund
performance versus performance of peers, the distribution yield of the Fund
versus peers, the trading discount of the Fund's common shares and the proposal
to transition portfolio management for the Fund to the Advisor's Leveraged
Finance Team, and (3) the approval of the Agreements.

To reach its determination, the Board considered its duties under the 1940 Act,
as well as under the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving
advisory contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the
fiduciary duty of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and
compensation; the standards used by courts in determining whether investment
company boards have fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by
the Board in voting on such agreements. The Board noted that it had recently
considered the Advisor's capabilities and the terms of the Original Investment
Management Agreement at a meeting held on March 21-22, 2010 and had determined
to renew the Original Investment Management Agreement for an additional one-year
term (the "2010 Renewal"). The Board considered that in connection with the 2010
Renewal, it had received a report from the Advisor that, among other things,
outlined the services provided by the Advisor (including the relevant personnel
responsible for these services and their experience); the advisory fees for the
Fund as compared to fees charged to other clients of the Advisor and as compared
to fees charged by investment advisors to comparable funds; expenses of the Fund
as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the nature of expenses
incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential for economies of

scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor; any fall out benefits to the
Advisor; and information on the Advisor's compliance program. Prior to the
September meeting, the Advisor represented to the Board that there had been no
material changes to the information provided in March 2010 with respect to the
Original Investment Management Agreement and that the Board could continue to
rely on such information. The Board determined that much of its previous
analysis in connection with the 2010 Renewal applied to its review and
consideration of the Agreements. Accordingly, the Board took note of such prior
analysis and supplemented it with the additional considerations noted below. The
Independent Trustees also met separately with their independent legal counsel to
discuss the Transaction, the proposal to transition portfolio management to the
Advisor's Leveraged Finance Team and the consideration of the Agreements.

In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered the nature, quality and extent
of services to be provided by the Advisor under the Agreements. The Board noted
that the Fund would no longer employ an advisor/sub-advisor management
structure, but rather, the Advisor would provide all management services for the
Fund, including the day-to-day management of the Fund's investment portfolio.
The Board considered the Advisor's statement that it plans to apply the same
oversight model internally with its Leveraged Finance Team as it uses for
overseeing external sub-advisors. The Board considered the information provided
by the Advisor regarding the capabilities of the Advisor's Leveraged Finance
Team, including information regarding the backgrounds of the Team members, past
performance of other registered investment companies and other accounts managed
by the Team and the Team's investment process, as well as information it had
learned from presentations at prior meetings by members of the Team. At the
September meeting, the Board received a presentation from the members of the
Leveraged Finance Team regarding the proposed management of the Fund. Finally,
the Board considered the Advisor's representation that it does not expect any
diminution in services provided under the Agreements. In light of the
information presented and the considerations made at the September meeting,
including the considerations made in connection with the 2010 Renewal, the Board
concluded that the nature, quality and extent of services to be provided to the
Fund by the Advisor under the Agreements are expected to be satisfactory.

The Board considered the advisory fee payable under the Agreements, noting that
it would be the same as the fee payable under the Original Investment Management
Agreement. The Board considered information provided by the Advisor comparing
the Fund's advisory fee to a peer group of other floating rate funds compiled by
Lipper, Inc. The Board noted that, based on the information provided, the Fund's
advisory fee was within the range of the advisory fees of the peer funds. The
Board also considered that in connection with the 2010 Renewal it had reviewed
the advisory fees charged by the Advisor to similar funds and other non-fund
clients, and had noted that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to
clients with investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's other than
to two other closed end funds (one of which had subsequently been liquidated) to
which different advisory fee rates are charged. In light of the information
presented on the advisory fee for the Fund and the considerations made at the
September meeting, including the considerations made in connection with the 2010
Renewal, the Board concluded that the advisory fee was reasonable and
appropriate in light of the nature, quality and extent of services expected to
be provided by the Advisor under the Agreements.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and considered whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale
for the benefit of shareholders. The Board concluded that the advisory fee
continues to reflect an appropriate level of sharing of any economies of scale
at current asset levels. The Board noted that in connection with the 2010
Renewal it had reviewed the costs of the services provided and profits realized
by the Advisor from serving as investment manager to the Fund for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2009. The Board considered its prior conclusion that
the Advisor's profitability appeared to be not excessive in light of the
services provided to the Fund; however, the Board noted that the profitability
information previously provided reflected the costs and profits associated with
an advisor/sub-advisor management structure. The Board considered the Advisor's
statement at the September 2010 meeting that it anticipates that it will be less
profitable for the Advisor under the New Investment Management Agreement. The
Board considered whether the Advisor derives any ancillary benefits from its
relationship with the Fund and noted that the typical fall out benefits to the
Advisor such as soft dollars are not present. The Board noted that the Advisor
will receive compensation from the Fund for providing fund reporting services.
The Board concluded that any other fall out benefits received by the Advisor or
its affiliates would appear to be limited.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the
Agreements are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the Agreements is in
the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was determinative in the
Board's analysis.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. Currently, the Leveraged Finance Investment
Team of First Trust does not manage or oversee any other funds or accounts.
Accordingly, there should not be material conflicts in the allocation of
investment opportunities between the Registrant and other accounts managed by
the Leveraged Finance Investment Team.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations. In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the
Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the
Leveraged Finance Investment Team are prohibited from buying or selling equity
securities (including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and
futures) and corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over
which they exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Investment Team
are also prohibited from engaging in any personal transaction while in
possession of material non-public information regarding the security or the
issuer of the security.

First Trust and FTP also maintain a confidential watch list of all issuers for
which the Leveraged Finance Investment Team has material non-public information
in its possession an all transactions executed for a product advised or
supervised by First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the watch list.


(3)     Compensation Structure of Portfolio Managers or Management Team Members
        Portfolio Manager Compensation

Information provided as of February 4, 2011.

The compensation structure for the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined
by the management of First Trust. Salaries are determined by management and are
based upon an individual's position and overall value to the firm. Bonuses are
also determined by management and are based upon an individual's overall
contribution to the success of the firm and the profitability of the firm.
Salaries and bonuses for members of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team are
not based upon criteria such as performance of the Registrant or the value of
assets of the Registrant.

         COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of trustees, where those
changes were implemented after the registrant last provided disclosure in
response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR
229.407) (as required by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101)),
or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

   (a) The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
       persons performing similar functions, have concluded that the
       registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
       30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
       Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective, as of a date within 90 days
       of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure required by
       this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls and
       procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
       270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Securities
       Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

   (b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
       reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
       270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second fiscal quarter
       of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is
       reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control
       over financial reporting.
