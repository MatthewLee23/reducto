LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
                                      OVERVIEW

PERFORMANCE

For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Morgan Stanley India Investment
Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") had a total return, based on net asset value per share
of -15.73%, compared to -17.49% for the U.S. dollar adjusted Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) National Index (the "Index"). On June 30, 2004, the closing price
of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $20.15, representing a
4.3% premium to the Fund's net asset value per share.

FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE

   -  Year-to-date, the popular BSE state-owned Index was down 22% in local
      terms as compared to the Index which was down 16.7% in local terms.

   -  Stocks of state-owned companies fell sharply after the announcement of the
      results of the general elections. As a result, some of the state-owned
      banks and energy stocks that the Fund owned felt this impact.

   -  The Fund's overweight in industrials contributed positively towards
      relative performance, while the underweight in technology detracted from
      relative performance.

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

   -  A powerful combination of abundant global liquidity, a cyclical economic
      upturn and ebullient foreign investor sentiment towards India made for
      spectacular gains in 2003. In our opinion, 2004 will be different. Excess
      liquidity can only take markets that far and the leading suppliers of
      global liquidity, from the U.S. to China, are in the process of tightening
      monetary policy. Coincidentally, global growth momentum may be waning.
      This is exactly the opposite of the 'sweet spot' witnessed last year.

   -  While global factors continue to drive emerging markets, we believe the
      Indian market faces the additional problem of the verdict from the general
      elections. The results have been interpreted as a vote against traditional
      economic reforms. While the Union Budget presented by the new government
      did allay fears of foreign investors that India was going down the
      socialistic path, there were few policy measures to suggest economic
      reforms were accelerating.

   -  In such an environment, our strategy will be more oriented towards stock
      selection. India is a very diverse market and it has historically been
      possible to generate positive returns even if the overall market is range
      bound. In this regard, we continue to favor long-term growth stories, as
      reflected in the Fund's top holdings. The only sector theme we remain
      convinced about is the power equipment industry, as we believe that the
      importance of this industry will continue to grow on the back of
      governmental initiatives.

Sincerely,


/s/ Ronald E. Robison

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                      June 30, 2004 (unaudited)

     The Morgan Stanley India Investment Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was
incorporated in Maryland on December 22, 1993, and is registered as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment
objective is long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in
equity securities.

A.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The following significant accounting policies are in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its
financial statements. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results may
differ from those estimates.

1.   SECURITY VALUATION: Equity securities listed on a U.S. exchange are valued
     at the latest quoted sales price on the valuation date. Equity securities
     listed or traded on NASDAQ, for which market quotations are available, are
     valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Securities listed on a foreign
     exchange are valued at their closing price. Unlisted securities and listed
     securities not traded on the valuation date for which market quotations are
     readily available are valued at the mean between the current bid and asked
     prices obtained from reputable brokers. Debt securities purchased with
     remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if it
     approximates value.

     All other securities and investments for which market values are not
     readily available, including restricted securities, and those securities
     for which it is inappropriate to determine prices in accordance with the
     aforementioned procedures, are valued at fair value as determined in good
     faith under procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, although the
     actual calculations may be done by others. Factors considered in making
     this determination may include, but are not limited to, information
     obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the appropriate stock
     exchange (for exchange-traded securities), analysis of the issuer's
     financial statements or other available documents and, if necessary,
     available information concerning other securities in similar circumstances.

     Most foreign markets close before the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
     Occasionally, developments that could affect the closing prices of
     securities and other assets may occur between the times at which valuations
     of such securities are determined (that is, close of the foreign market on
     which the securities trade) and the close of business on the NYSE. If these
     developments are expected to materially affect the value of the securities,
     the valuations may be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value as of
     the close of the NYSE, as determined in good faith under procedures
     established by the Board of Directors.

2.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements under
     which the Fund lends excess cash and takes possession of securities with an
     agreement that the counterparty will repurchase such securities. In
     connection with transactions in repurchase agreements, a bank as custodian
     for the Fund takes possession of the underlying securities (collateral),
     with a market value at least equal to the amount of the repurchase
     transaction, including principal and accrued interest. To the extent that
     any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the
     collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to determine the adequacy
     of the collateral. In the event of default on the obligation to repurchase,
     the Fund has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds
     in satisfaction of the obligation. In the event of default or bankruptcy by
     the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the
     collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings.

     The Fund, along with other affiliated investment companies, may utilize a
     joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or more
     repurchase agreements.

3.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The books and records of the Fund are
     maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts denominated in Indian rupees are
     translated into U.S. dollars at the mean of the bid and asked prices of
     such currency against U.S. dollars last quoted by a major bank as follows:

     -    investments, other assets and liabilities at the prevailing rate of
          exchange on the valuation date;

     -    investment transactions and investment income at the prevailing rate
          of exchange on the dates of such transactions.

     Although the net assets of the Fund are presented at the foreign exchange
     rate and market values at the close of the period, the Fund does not
     isolate that portion of the

                                                                               7

                                      MORGAN STANLEY INDIA INVESTMENT FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)
                                      June 30, 2004 (unaudited)

     results of operations arising as a result of changes in the foreign
     exchange rate from the fluctuations arising from changes in the market
     prices of the securities held at period end. Similarly, the Fund does not
     isolate the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rate from the
     fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities sold
     during the period. Accordingly, realized and unrealized foreign currency
     gains (losses) due to securities transactions are included in the reported
     net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment transactions and
     balances.

     Net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions represent net
     foreign exchange gains (losses) from sales and maturities of foreign
     currency exchange contracts, disposition of foreign currency, currency
     gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on
     securities transactions, and the difference between the amount of
     investment income and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund's
     books and the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net
     unrealized currency gains (losses) from valuing foreign currency
     denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are
     reflected as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
     investments and foreign currency translations in the Statement of Net
     Assets. The change in unrealized currency gains (losses) on foreign
     currency translations for the period is reflected in the Statement of
     Operations.

     A significant portion of the Fund's net assets consist of Indian securities
     which involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated
     with investments in the United States. In addition to its smaller size,
     less liquidity and greater volatility, the Indian securities market is less
     developed than the U.S. securities market and there is often substantially
     less publicly available information about Indian issuers than there is
     about U.S. issuers. Settlement mechanisms are also less developed and are
     accomplished, in certain cases, only through physical delivery, which may
     cause the Fund to experience delays or other difficulties in effecting
     transactions.

The Fund may use derivatives to achieve its investment objectives. The Fund may
engage in transactions in futures contracts on foreign currencies, stock
indices, as well as in options, swaps and structured notes. Consistent with the
Fund's investment objectives and policies, the Fund may use derivatives for
non-hedging as well as hedging purposes.

Following is a description of derivative instruments that the Fund has utilized
and their associated risks:

4.   FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS: The Fund may enter into foreign
     currency exchange contracts generally to attempt to protect securities and
     related receivables and payables against changes in future foreign exchange
     rates and, in certain situations, to gain exposure to a foreign currency. A
     foreign currency exchange contract is an agreement between two parties to
     buy or sell currency at a set price on a future date. The market value of
     the contract will fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The
     contract is marked-to-market daily and the change in market value is
     recorded by the Fund as unrealized gain or loss. The Fund records realized
     gains or losses when the contract is closed equal to the difference between
     the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
     time it was closed. Risk may arise upon entering into these contracts from
     the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
     contracts and is generally limited to the amount of unrealized gain on the
     contracts, if any, at the date of default. Risks may also arise from
     unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign currency relative to the
     U.S. dollar.

5.   OTHER: Security transactions are accounted for on the date the securities
     are purchased or sold. Investments in new Indian securities are made by
     making applications in the public offerings. The issue price, or a portion
     thereof, is paid at the time of application and reflected as share
     application money on the Statement of Net Assets. Upon allotment of the
     securities, this amount plus any remaining amount of issue price is
     recorded as cost of investments. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
     investment securities are determined on the specific identified cost basis.
     Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Dividend income is
     recorded on the ex-dividend date (except certain dividends which may be
     recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of such dividends) net of
     applicable withholding taxes, if any. Distributions to stockholders are
     recorded on the ex-dividend date.

B.   ADVISER: Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. (the "Adviser") provides
investment advisory services to the Fund under the terms of an Investment
Advisory and Management Agreement (the "Agreement"). Under the Agreement, the
Adviser is paid a fee computed weekly and payable monthly at an annual rate of
1.10% of the Fund's average weekly net assets.

                                      June 30, 2004 (unaudited)

C.   ADMINISTRATOR: JPMorgan Chase Bank, through its corporate affiliate J.P.
Morgan Investor Services Co. (the "Administrator"), provides administrative
services to the Fund under an Administration Agreement. The Administrator is
paid a fee computed weekly and payable monthly at an annual rate of 0.02435% of
the Fund's average weekly net assets, plus $24,000 per annum. In addition, the
Fund is charged for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrator
on its behalf. An employee of the Administrator is an Officer of the Fund.

Multiconsult, Ltd., whose registered office is in Mauritius, provides
sub-administrative services to the Fund, including maintaining certain Fund
records and preparing certain periodic filings, under an agreement whereby
Multiconsult is paid a fee of $22,000 per annum.

D.   CUSTODIAN: JPMorgan Chase Bank serves as custodian for the Fund. The
Custodian holds cash, securities, and other assets of the Fund as required by
the 1940 Act. Custody fees are payable monthly based on assets held in custody,
investment purchases and sales activity and account maintenance fees, plus
reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

E.   DIRECTORS: The Fund pays each of its Mauritian Independent Directors an
annual fee of $7,500 and all other Independent Directors an annual fee of
$5,000. Additionally, each Mauritian Independent Director is paid a fee of $750
for each Board Meeting attended.

F.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as
a regulated investment company and distribute all its taxable income.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is required in the financial
statements. Dividend income and distributions to stockholders are recorded on
the ex-dividend date.

The rate of capital gains tax in India is 10.25% for long-term investments and
30.75% for short-term investments (the capital gains rates were 10.5% for
long-term investments and 31.5% for short-term investments for the financial
year ended March 31, 2003). The Fund invests in India through a registered
branch office established in Mauritius and, as a result, obtains the benefits
under the double taxation treaty between Mauritius and India ("Treaty"). To
obtain benefits under the double taxation treaty the Fund must meet certain
tests and conditions, including the establishment of Mauritius tax residence and
related requirements. The Fund has obtained a tax residence certification from
the Mauritian authorities and believes such certification is determinative of
its resident status for treaty purposes. A fund which is a tax resident in
Mauritius under the treaty but has no branch or permanent establishment in India
will not be subject to capital gains tax in India on the sale of securities, but
is subject to a 15% withholding tax on dividends declared, distributed or paid
by an Indian company prior to June 1, 1997 and for the period from April 1, 2002
through March 31, 2003. During the period June 1, 1997 through March 31, 2002
and after April 1, 2003, dividend income from domestic companies was exempt from
Indian income tax. The Fund currently is subject to and accrues Indian
withholding tax on interest earned on Indian securities at 20.5% (21% for the
financial year ended March 31, 2003).

The Treaty benefits accorded to foreign investors were challenged by a
non-governmental organization and the matter was litigated before India's
Supreme Court (the highest court in India ). In October 2003, India's Supreme
Court upheld the validity of treaty benefits accorded to foreign investors on
the basis of a certificate of residence issued by Mauritian authorities (such as
the one obtained by the Fund).

The tax character of distributions paid may differ from the character of
distributions shown on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets due to short-term
capital gains being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. The tax
character of distributions paid during 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

</Table>

The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to be paid by
the Fund are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The book/tax differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature.

Temporary differences are attributable to differing book and tax treatments for
the timing of the recognition of gains and losses on certain investment
transactions and the timing of the deductibility of certain expenses.

Permanent book and tax basis differences may result in reclassifications among
undistributed (distributions in excess of) net investment income (or accumulated
net investment loss), accumulated net realized gain (loss) and paid-in capital.

                                                                               9

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)
                                      June 30, 2004 (unaudited)

At December 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:


<Table>
<Caption>
                UNDISTRIBUTED                  UNDISTRIBUTED
               ORDINARY INCOME             LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN
                   (000)                          (000)
         -----------------------------------------------------------
                    <S>                            <C>
                    $321                           $--
         -----------------------------------------------------------
</Table>

At June 30, 2004, the U.S. Federal income tax cost basis of investments was
$250,959,000 and, accordingly, net unrealized appreciation for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes was $47,332,000 of which $75,098,000 related to appreciated
securities and $27,766,000 related to depreciated securities.

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had a capital loss carryforwards for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes of approximately $61,101,000 available to offset future
capital gains, of which $43,303,000 will expire on December 31, 2009 and
$17,798,000 will expire on December 31, 2010.

To the extent that capital loss carryforwards are used to offset any future
capital gains realized during the carryforward period as provided by U.S.
Federal income tax regulations, no capital gains tax liability will be incurred
by the Fund for gains realized and not distributed. To the extent that capital
gains are offset, such gains will not be distributed to the stockholders.

Net capital and currency losses incurred after October 31, and within the
taxable year are deemed to arise on the first business day of the Fund's next
taxable year. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Fund did not defer any
capital losses to January 1, 2004, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

G. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS: The Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

H. OTHER: During the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Fund made purchases and
sales totaling $110,849,000 and $122,037,000 respectively, of investment
securities other than long-term U.S. Government securities and short-term
investments. There were no purchases or sales of long-term U.S. Government
securities.

Future economic and political developments in India could adversely affect the
liquidity or value, or both, of securities in which the Fund is invested. In
addition, the Fund's ability to hedge its currency risk is limited and
accordingly, the Fund may be exposed to currency devaluation and other exchange
rate fluctuations.

On August 10, 1998, the Fund commenced a share repurchase program for purposes
of enhancing stockholder value and reducing the discount at which the Fund's
shares trade from their net asset value. During the six months ended June 30,
2004, the Fund did not repurchase any of its shares. Since the inception of the
program, the Fund has repurchased 8,450,680 of its shares at an average discount
of 30.06% from net asset value per share. The Fund expects to continue to
repurchase its outstanding shares at such time and in such amounts as it
believes will further the accomplishment of the foregoing objectives, subject to
review by the Board of Directors.

On June 21, 2004 the Officers of the Fund, pursuant to authority granted by the
Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.0201 per share, derived from
net investment income, payable on July 15, 2004, to stockholders of record on
June 30, 2004.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

  Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
each stockholder will be deemed to have elected, unless American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company (the "Plan Agent") is otherwise instructed by the stockholder in
writing, to have all distributions automatically reinvested in Fund shares.
Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional voluntary cash
payments to the Plan Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for
investment in Fund shares.

  Dividend and capital gain distributions will be reinvested on the reinvestment
date in full and fractional shares. If the market price per share equals or
exceeds net asset value per share on the reinvestment date, the Fund will issue
shares to participants at net asset value. If net asset value is less than 95%
of the market price on the reinvestment date, shares will be issued at 95% of
the market price. If net asset value exceeds the market price on the
reinvestment date, participants will receive shares valued at market price. The
Fund may purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market in connection
with dividend reinvestment requirements at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Should the Fund declare a dividend or capital gain distribution
payable only in cash, the Plan Agent will purchase Fund shares for participants
in the open market as agent for the participants.

  The Plan Agent's fees for the reinvestment of dividends and distributions will
be paid by the Fund. However, each participant's account will be charged a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred on any open market purchases
effected on such participant's behalf. A participant will also pay brokerage
commissions incurred on purchases made by voluntary cash payments. Although
stockholders in the Plan may receive no cash distributions, participation in the
Plan will not relieve participants of any income tax which may be payable on
such dividends or distributions.

  In the case of stockholders, such as banks, brokers or nominees, that hold
shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer
the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the
stockholder as representing the total amount registered in the stockholder's
name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are participating in the
Plan.

  Stockholders who do not wish to have distributions automatically reinvested
should notify the Plan Agent in writing. There is no penalty for
non-participation or withdrawal from the Plan, and stockholders who have
previously withdrawn from the Plan may rejoin at any time. Requests for
additional information or any correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Plan Agent at:
