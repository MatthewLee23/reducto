President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

As we move past the midway point of 2014, U.S. economic growth is still expected
to exceed 2% for the full calendar year, despite the fact that U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter was revised down to -2.9% in May.
The markets, in fact, almost completely ignored that bad news, as more timely
data -- especially labor market data -- pointed to continuing economic strength.
By mid-year, the number of people filing initial unemployment claims and the
number of job openings were at levels last seen during the boom years of 2005
through 2007, and unemployment was down to just over 6%. Barring an external
shock, we think it's likely that the domestic economic expansion will continue.

A modestly improving European economy and continuing economic improvement in
Japan appear likely to result in improving global economic growth in the second
half of 2014, further supporting the U.S. economy. Some slack remains in the
labor markets and capacity utilization, which offers the potential for
continuing non-inflationary growth.

The Federal Reserve System (the Fed) is widely expected to end its QE
(quantitative easing) program by the end of this year, and to begin raising the
Federal funds rate in 2015. The timing and pace of Fed's actions remain
uncertain: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has continually stressed that Fed policy will
be sensitive to incoming economic data.

While the U.S. economy appears robust and the global economy seems to be
improving, there are still weaknesses and risks to the economic outlook. Risks
of an adverse shock also remain. Military conflicts and political tensions are
widespread, with particular concerns about recent developments in the Middle
East that could prove disruptive to the global oil supply. While most of the
widely recognized risks may already be "priced into" the market, we caution
against complacency and believe investors should continue to expect market
volatility.

At Pioneer, we have long advocated the benefits of staying diversified and
investing for the long term. And while diversification does not assure a profit
or protect against loss in a declining market, we believe there are still
opportunities for prudent investors to earn attractive returns. Our advice, as
always, is to work closely with a trusted financial advisor to discuss your
goals

2 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14

and work together to develop an investment strategy that meets your
individual needs, keeping in mind that there is no single best strategy that
works for every investor.

Pioneer's investment teams have, since 1928, sought out attractive opportunities
in equity and bond markets, using in-depth research to identify undervalued
individual securities, and using thoughtful risk management to construct
portfolios which seek to balance potential risks and rewards in an ever-changing
world.

We encourage you to learn more about Pioneer and our time-tested approach to
investing by consulting with your financial advisor or visiting us online at
us.pioneerinvestments.com. We greatly appreciate your trust in us, and we thank
you for investing with Pioneer.

Sincerely,

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/14

Investments in bank loans produced positive returns over the six-month period
ended May 31, 2014, even as the market environment changed from one month to
another. In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that
affected the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six-month
period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and portfolio manager at Pioneer,
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q   How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2014?

A   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.01% at net asset value and 3.14% at
    market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2014. During the same
    six-month period, the Trust's benchmark, the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans
    Index (the Barclays Index), returned 2.43% at net asset value. Unlike the
    Trust, the Barclays Index does not use leverage. While the use of leverage
    increases investment opportunity, it also increases investment risk. During
    the same six-month period, the average return (at market price) of the 22
    closed-end funds in Lipper's Loan Participation Funds category (which may or
    may not be leveraged) was 2.85%.

    The shares of the Trust were selling at a 5.1% discount to net asset value
    on May 31, 2014.

    On May 31, 2014, the Trust's standard 30-day SEC yield was 5.05%*.

Q   How would you describe the investment environment for floating-rate loans
    during the six-month period ended May 31, 2014?

A   The investment market for floating-rate loans was generally positive during
    the six-month period, although varying supply-and-demand factors influenced
    shorter-term, monthly conditions. Throughout the period, the U.S. economy
    showed signs of improvement, leading to strengthened corporate finances and
    low default rates. This, in turn, encouraged investments in
    credit-sensitive asset classes such as bank loans. The investment backdrop
    was particularly supportive at the start of the period in December 2013,
    and the positive environment continued into January 2014 as the overall
    bank loan market enjoyed the effects of significant inflows of investor
    money. The environment changed in February, however, as many corporate
    borrowers began refinancing their debt at lower rates to take

    advantage of increased investor demand, resulting in a significant increase
    in the supply of new loans. While the overall loan market was negative in
    February, it turned positive again in March as the supply/demand
    relationships moved back into balance. In the month of April, the market
    experienced minor negative price movement, but still ended the month in
    positive territory. Also during April, the market witnessed an end to a
    streak of 93 consecutive weeks of positive inflows as investors anticipated
    a longer wait for any future Federal funds rate increases. May, the final
    month of the period, saw the bank loan market again turn positive as a
    notable increase in the issuance of new collateralized loan obligations
    renewed investor demand. (Collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, are
    pooled investment vehicles created by financial institutions to invest in
    the loan market.)

Q   What was your overall strategy in managing the Trust's portfolio during the
    six-month period ended May 31, 2014?

A   We kept our focus on credit research and fundamental analysis while seeking
    loan investment opportunities during the six-month period. The portfolio's
    overall positioning tended to place greater emphasis on holding higher-rated
    loans than were represented in the Trust's benchmark. However, we did
    increase the portfolio's exposure to B-rated loans during the period, for
    two reasons. First, during the period, an increasing percentage of new loans
    issued were either B or CCC-rated. As such, there was a greater selection of
    these loans available to the Trust. Second, we continued to see a relatively
    benign credit market during the period. Given the combination of these
    factors, we felt it made sense to give the Trust a bit greater exposure to
    B-rated loans in order to take advantage of the higher yields such loans
    offer.

Q   Did the use of derivatives affect the Trust's performance during the 6-month
    period ended May 31, 2014?

A   We did use forward currency contracts to reduce the potential risks to the
    Trust's portfolio created by volatility in the relative values of different
    currencies. The tactic had a slight positive influence on the Trust's
    performance during the 6-month period.

Q   Which individual investments had the greatest effects on the Trust's
    performance during the six-month period ended May 31, 2014?

A   Positions in CLOs provided good support to the Trust's results during the
    period, as both the primary and secondary markets for CLO investment pools
    improved. Specifically, the portfolio's investment in loans to AccentCare, a
    provider of home health care services, contributed to the

                  Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14    5
<PAGE>

    Trust's positive results. The loans continued to increase in value during
    the period as the company went through restructuring. Also supporting the
    Trust's performance during the period were portfolio investments in loans to
    auto components manufacturer Delphi, and in the debt of Medical Card System,
    a provider of health and life insurance plans.

    A notable detractor from the Trust's performance during the six-month period
    was the portfolio's equity position in Media General, a broadcasting company
    whose securities declined in value along with other broadcasting companies
    due to concerns over new FCC rules affecting the industry. The Trust had
    acquired the equity position after the finances of Young Broadcasting were
    reorganized and some stock was issued to loan holders. Young Broadcasting
    subsequently was acquired by Media General, and the equity position became
    that of the acquiring company. The Media General position had actually been
    a positive contributor to the Trust's performance until recently. Other
    portfolio holdings that hurt the Trust's performance during the period
    included loans to Weight Watchers International, which failed to meet
    earnings expectations, and the debt of mining corporation Bumi
    International, which declined in value because of a controversy over the
    company's ownership as well as declining coal prices on the global market.

Q   How did the level of leverage in the Trust change during the six-month
    period ended May 31, 2014?

A   The Trust historically employed leverage through the issuance of auction
    rate preferred shares (AMPS). Between December 3, 2013 and December 6, 2013,
    the Trust redeemed all of its outstanding AMPS. The Trust then refinanced
    the AMPS through a revolving credit facility (see Note 7). The Trust
    refinanced in order to secure a lower cost of financing.

    At the end of the six month period on May 31, 2014, 32.9% of the Trust's
    total managed assets were financed by leverage (or borrowed funds), compared
    with 36.1% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by leverage at the
    start of the period on December 1, 2013. During the period, the absolute
    amount of leverage employed by the Trust was reduced from $182.5 million to
    $157.5 million. This reduction was due to regulatory requirements related to
    refinancing the AMPS with a revolving credit facility (see Note 7). This
    lower level of financing is not expected to diminish distribution levels
    because of the lowered cost of borrowing.

Q   What is your investment outlook?

A   We have a generally positive view of investment opportunities in the bank
    loan market. We expect that the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) will begin
    to raise short-term interest rates (the Federal funds rate) in 2015.


6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14
<PAGE>

    However, market interest rates may start rising sooner than that in
    anticipation of an adjustment of the Fed's policies. As market interest
    rates start ascending,    that will likely have a negative effect on
    longer-duration* fixed-income assets. Floating-rate loans, which are
    shorter-duration instruments, ought to be less affected by increases in
    long-term market rates. In addition, we anticipate that the overall economy
    should continue to grow and that the financial health of corporations in
    general should continue to improve. This would likely keep loan default
    rates below historical levels for the next 12 months.

    When interest rates increase the borrowing costs for closed end funds will
    also increase. We believe closed end funds that focus on floating-rate
    loans may have an advantage over other closed end funds that do not focus
    on floating-rate loans. For that reason, the aforementioned increases in
    borrowing costs for closed end funds ought to be partially offset by income
    as yields of floating-rate loans increase in conjunction with rising
    interest rates.

    principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates,
    expressed as a number of years.}

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-41 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of their value at
times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the market price of
illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment of the
Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

Historically, the Trust employed leverage through the issuance of preferred
shares. The Trust has redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares. The
Trust continues to employ leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage
creates significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for the holders of common shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such as
redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the net
earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. These statements should not
be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total liabilities,
which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable, divided by the
number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

* The Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index measures the performance of
high-yield loans. Since comparisons for the Barclays Index begin in 2006, the
chart assumes an initial investment of $10,913, which is equal to the Trust's
value at 11/30/2006.

** The CS Leveraged Loan Index (the CS Index) is a representative index of
tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The CS Index began in
January 1992. Comparisons to the Trust for the CS Index begin in 2004.  The CS
Index was the Trust's benchmark through March 1, 2011, and was at that time
replaced by the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
Index). Because the historical performance of the Barclays Index dates back only
to 2006, two years after the inception of the Trust in 2004, the Trust will
continue to provide "Market Value of $10,000 Investment" comparisons for both
the CS Index and the Barclays Index.

Returns of both indices are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
The indices do not use leverage.  You cannot invest directly in an index.

+   Return for the CS Leveraged Loan Index covers the entire performance history
    of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (December 28, 2004 through May 31, 2014).
    Return for the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index covers the maximum
    period for which that index's performance is available (December 30, 2005
    through May 31, 2014).

NR       Security not rated by S&P or Moody's.

(144A)   Security is exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities
         Act of 1933. Such securities may be resold normally to qualified
         institutional buyers in a transaction exempt from registration. At May
         31, 2014, the value of these securities amounted to $11,939,631, or
         3.7% of total net assets applicable to common shareowners.

*        Senior secured floating rate loan interests in which the Trust
         invests generally pay interest at rates that are periodically
         redetermined by reference to a base lending plus a premium. These
         base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered by
         one or more major European banks, such as LIBOR (London InterBank
         Offered Rate), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
         United States banks, (iii) the rate of a certificate of deposit or
         (iv) other base lending rates used by commercial lenders. The
         interest rate shown is the rate accruing at May 31, 2014.

(a)      Security is in default and is non income producing.

(b)      Indicates a security that has been deemed illiquid. As of May 31, 2014
         the aggregate cost of illiquid securities in the Trust's portfolio was
         $21,590,191. As of that date, the aggregate value of illiquid
         securities in the Trust's portfolio of $10,443,795 represented 3.3% of
         total net assets applicable to common shareowners.

(c)      The company and agent bank are in the process of negotiating
         forbearance.

(d)      Payment in Kind (PIK) security which may pay interest in the form of
         additional principal amount.

(e)      Non-income producing.

(f)      Floating rate note. The interest rate shown is the coupon rate at
         May 31, 2014.

(g)      Security represents a liquidating trust which is a vehicle which
         through future settlements of bankruptcy claims are dispersed to
         creditors.

(h)      Security represents a claim which is subject to bankruptcy court
         findings which may result in an exchange of money, assets or
         equity.

(i)      Security is valued using fair value methods (other than prices supplied
         by independent pricing services). See Notes to Financial
         Statements -- Note 1A.

(j)      At May 31, 2014, the net unrealized depreciation on investments
         based on cost for federal tax purposes of $479,440,206 was as

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below.

    Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

    Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
               similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
               risks, etc.).

    Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
               assumptions in determining fair value of investments). See Notes
               to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

Generally, equity securities are categorized as Level 1, fixed income securities
and senior loans are categorized as Level 2, and securities valued using fair
value methods (other than prices supplied by independent pricing services or
broker dealers) as Level 3. See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of May 31, 2014, in valuing the
Trust's investments.

Notes to Financial Statements | 5/31/14 (unaudited)

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust
will, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent
consistent with its primary objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.   Security Valuation

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
     loan interests (senior loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
     established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
     bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
     Loan Pricing Corporation, an independent pricing service. If price
     information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation or if the price
     information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
     from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
     quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing service
     broker quotes will be solicited. Fixed-income securities with remaining
     maturities of more than sixty days are valued at prices supplied by
     independent pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices,
     market events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads,
     yields, maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers
     and other sources, as required. Equity securities that have traded on an
     exchange are valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange where
     they are traded. Equity securities that have not traded on the date of
     valuation or securities for which sale prices are not available, generally
     are valued using the mean between the last bid and

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14
<PAGE>

     asked prices. Short-term fixed income securities with remaining maturities
     of sixty days or less generally are valued at amortized cost. Shares of
     money market mutual funds are valued at such funds' net asset value.

     Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at
     various times prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
     The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
     Trust's shares are determined as of such times.

     Securities and loan interests for which independent pricing services are
     unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are
     not readily available, are unchanged for 10 days or more, or are
     considered to be unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised
     of certain personnel of Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), the
     Trust's investment adviser, pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's
     Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team uses fair value methods
     approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. PIM's
     valuation team is responsible for monitoring developments that may impact
     fair valued securities and for discussing and assessing fair value on an
     ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the Valuation Committee of the
     Board of Trustees.

     Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
     include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
     market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
     methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after
     the close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior
     to the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a
     significant event might include political or economic news, corporate
     restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts.
     Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ significantly
     from exchange prices and such differences could be material.

     At May 31, 2014, 9 securities were valued using fair value methods (other
     than securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
     services or broker-dealers) representing 0.0% of net assets applicable to
     common shareowners. The value of these fair valued securities are $0.

     Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
     respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to
     maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis
     of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain mortgage-backed
     securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the monthly
     paydowns. Interest income, including interest on income bearing cash
     accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign
     taxes withheld at the applicable country rates.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14 49
<PAGE>

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Gains and losses on sales of
     investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both financial
     reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
     represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
     currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
     between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually
     received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
     rates on investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
     the effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are
     included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
     exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
     realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a
     closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may
     arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
     counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
     movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
     (see Note 5).

D.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
     shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As of
     November 30, 2013, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties with
     respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be recorded
     as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax returns filed
     within the prior three years remain subject to examination by federal and
     state tax authorities.

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14
<PAGE>

     The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
     shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
     which differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
     temporary overdistributions for financial statement purposes resulting
     from differences in the recognition or classification of income or
     distributions for financial statement and tax purposes. Capital accounts
     within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book/tax
     differences to reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for temporary
     differences.

     The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareowners
     will be determined at the end of the current taxable year. The tax
     character of distributions paid to shareowners during the year ended
     November 30, 2013 was as follows:

     =============================================================================
</TABLE>

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
     gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
     difference between book and tax amortization methods for premiums and
     discounts on fixed income securities and other temporary book/tax
     differences.

E.   Risks

     Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
     Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
     in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer
     to those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times,
     the Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that
     are interrelated

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14 51
<PAGE>

     or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any economic,
     political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those
     industries and sectors.

     The Trust invests primarily in senior loans. The Trust may also invest in
     other floating and variable rate instruments, including second lien loans,
     investment grade fixed-income debt securities and high yield, high risk
     corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below investment grade
     securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly referred to as
     "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's
     capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Below investment grade
     securities, including floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss,
     are subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid and more
     difficult to value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or
     change, than higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in
     securities of issuers that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The
     value of collateral, if any, securing a floating rate loan can decline or
     may decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may
     be difficult to liquidate. No active trading market may exist for floating
     rate loans, and many loans are subject to restrictions on resale. Any
     secondary market may be subject to irregular trading activity and extended
     settlement periods. Additionally, the Trust may invest in "event-linked"
     bonds, which sometimes are referred to as "insurance-linked" or
     "catastrophe" bonds. The return of principal and the payment of interest on
     event-linked bonds are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined
     "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific
     magnitude. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds
     may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
     (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
     adverse tax consequences.

     The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with
     limited developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of
     risk than in a developed market. These risks include disruptive political
     or economic conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental
     laws or currency exchange restrictions.

     The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
     invested in senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
     Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when
     the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is
     generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid
     securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the Trust's
     assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
     advantage of market opportunities.

<PAGE>

F.   Repurchase Agreements

     With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
     of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
     required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The
     collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
     customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or a sub-custodian of the
     Trust. PIM is responsible for determining that the value of the collateral
     remains at least equal to the repurchase price.

G.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
     automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
     Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
     distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common
     shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to
     participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive
     all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the
     Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time
     without penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the
     agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in
     writing prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or
     resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
     dividend or other distribution.

     If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
     other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate
     in the Plan on the shareowner's behalf.  If the firm or nominee does not
     offer the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of
     record. A firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in
     common shares of the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the
     Plan.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
     acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
     unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase
     of outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common
     share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
     brokerage trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
     common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by
     dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per
     common share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum
     discount from the then current market price per share on the date of
     issuance

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14 53
<PAGE>

     does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset
     value per common share is greater than the market value (market discount),
     the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired
     in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to
     newly issued common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata
     share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
     open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another broker
     and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not
include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the six months ended May 31, 2014, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.05% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May 31, 2014,
$360,945 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative costs
and certain other services and is included in "Affiliated expenses payable" and
"Administration fees payable" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trust at negotiated rates. In
addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Trust's custodian expenses. For the six months ended May 31, 2014, the Trust
expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.

5. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

At May 31, 2014, the Trust had entered forward foreign currency contracts that
obligate the Trust to deliver or take delivery of currencies at specified future
maturity dates. Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of a forward foreign

offsetting contract. The average value of contracts open during the six months
ended May 31, 2014 was $642,657.

Effective November 29, 2013, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000.

At May 31, 2014, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $157,450,000. The interest rate charged at May 31, 2014 was

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/14 55
<PAGE>

balance was $157,450,000 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. With
respect to the loan, interest expense of $786,956 is included in the Statement
of Operations. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all of the Trust's auction market preferred shares (see Note 11).

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities, not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowings outstanding.

As of the date indicated below, the Trust's debt outstanding and asset coverage
were as follows:

      The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets (net assets plus borrowings
      for investment purposes) in floating rate loans and other securities of
      non-U.S. issuers, including emerging markets securities.

Risks of investing in floating rate loans. Floating rate loans typically are
rated below investment grade (debt securities rated below investment grade are
commonly referred to as "junk bonds"). The fund's investments in floating rate
loans may include unsecured or subordinated loans. Floating rate loans and
similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments. No
active trading market may exist for many floating rate loans, and many loans are
subject to restrictions on resale. Market quotations for these securities may be
volatile and/or subject to large spreads between bid and ask prices. Any
secondary market may be subject to irregular trading activity and extended trade
settlement periods. An economic downturn generally leads to a higher non-payment
rate, and a loan may lose significant value before a default occurs. There is
less readily available, reliable information about loans than is the case for
other types of securities. Although the features of loans, including

<PAGE>

typically being secured by collateral and having priority over other obligations
of the issuer, reduce some of the risks of investment in below investment grade
securities, the loans are subject to significant risks. Certain floating rate
loans and other corporate debt securities involve refinancings,
recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, and other financings for general
corporate purposes.  Other loans are incurred in restructuring or "work-out"
scenarios, including debtor-in-possession facilities in bankruptcy. Loans to
highly leveraged companies are especially vulnerable to adverse economic or
market conditions and the risk of default.

Risks of second lien and other subordinated securities.  Second lien loans
generally are subject to similar risks as those associated with senior (first
lien) loans. Because second lien loans are subordinated and thus lower in
priority on payment to senior loans, they are subject to the additional risk
that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan or debt, if
any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the
senior secured obligations of the borrower. This risk is generally higher for
subordinated unsecured loans or debt, which are not backed by a security
interest in any specific collateral. Second lien loans generally have greater
price volatility than senior loans and may be less liquid. Second lien loans and
other subordinated securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than
non-subordinated securities of the same issuer, any loss incurred by the
subordinated securities is likely to be proportionately greater, and any
recovery of interest or principal may take more time. As a result, even a
perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer is likely to have a greater
impact on them.

Risks of non-U.S. investments. Investing in non-U.S. issuers, or in U.S. issuers
that have significant exposure to foreign markets, may involve unique risks
compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers. These risks are more
pronounced for issuers in emerging markets or to the extent that the fund
invests significantly in one region or country. These risks may include
different financial reporting practices and regulatory standards, less liquid
trading markets, extreme price volatility, currency risks, changes in economic,
political, regulatory and social conditions, sustained economic downturns,
financial instability, tax burdens, and investment and repatriation
restrictions. Lack of information and less market regulation also may affect the
value of these securities. Withholding and other non-U.S. taxes may decrease the
fund's return. Non-U.S. issuers may be located in parts of the world that have
historically been prone to natural disasters. Investing in depositary receipts
is subject to many of the same risks as investing directly in non-U.S. issuers.
Depository receipts may involve higher expenses and may trade at a discount (or
premium) to the underlying security.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund, with the approval
and recommendation of the Audit Committee, appointed
Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Fund's
independent registered public accounting firm for the
fiscal year ending November 30, 2014. Deloitte &
Touche LLP replaces Ernst & Young LLP, which
resigned as the Fund's independent registered public
accounting firm, effective upon completion of the audit of
the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2013.

During the periods that Ernst & Young LLP served as the
Fund's independent registered public accounting firm,
including the Fund's two most recent fiscal years, Ernst
& Young LLP's reports on the financial statements of the
Fund have not contained an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and have not been qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles. Further, there have been no disagreements
with Ernst & Young LLP on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP would have caused
Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its report
on the financial statements. In addition, there have been
no
reportable events of the kind described in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.
