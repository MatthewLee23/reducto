President's Message

The views expressed in the President's Letter and Portfolio Manager's Report
reflect current views of the respective parties. These views are not guarantees
of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict so actual outcomes and results may differ
significantly from the views expressed. These views are subject to change at any
time based upon economic, market or other conditions and the respective parties
disclaim any responsibility to update such views. These views may not be relied
on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for a Colonial Fund
are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading
intent on behalf of any particular Colonial Fund. References to specific company
securities should not be construed as a recommendation or investment advice.

Dear Shareholder:

The US financial markets withstood a host of unfavorable factors to deliver a
year of positive investment returns. Record energy prices took a significant
bite out of household budgets and raised operating costs for industry. Higher
short-term interest rates made borrowing more expensive. Two catastrophic
hurricanes exacted an enormous personal toll from Americans living in the Gulf
Coast: the storms claimed lives, disrupted energy flows and dealt a sharp blow
to local job markets. Yet, the US economy moved ahead at a healthy pace during
the 12-month period that began December 1, 2004 and ended November 30, 2005.

FIXED INCOME MARKETS DELIVERED MODEST GAINS

In this environment, the US fixed income markets delivered positive but modest
returns. Short-term interest rates rose steadily as the Federal Reserve Board
raised a key intrabank lending rate. Longer-term rates remained low during most
of the year. However, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a bellwether
for the bond market edged up to 4.5% by the end of this reporting period. In
this environment, most domestic bond market sectors delivered low single-digit
returns. Generally, high-yield bonds continued to perform well despite a setback
in the spring, when bonds of certain high profile companies were downgraded.
However, municipal bonds generally performed better than high yield bonds--even
before accounting for their tax-exempt status--as state revenues increased and
budgets stabilized.

In the pages that follow, your fund's manager discusses key factors that
influenced performance. We urge you to read this report carefully and discuss
any questions you might have with your financial advisor.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial Funds.

Sincerely,


/s/ Christopher L. Wilson

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the 12-month period ended November 30, 2005, Colonial Investment Grade
Municipal Trust generated a total return of 10.68%, based on its market price.
The trust returned 6.19%, based on investment at net asset value. This was
slightly lower than the average return of the Lipper General Municipal Debt
Funds (Leveraged) Category, which was 6.61% for the same period. 1 The trust
benefited from its relatively shorter duration in the second half of the period,
which we believe made it less sensitive to interest rate changes than its peers.
Duration is a measure of interest rate sensitivity. An above-average stake in
lower quality, higher-yielding bonds also helped performance.

The trust lost some ground relative to its peer group because of a sizable
investment in non-callable bonds with lower yields. The trust also had less
exposure than many of its peers to airline and tobacco bonds, which hampered
returns as these sectors rallied even more than other high-yield sectors in the
first half of the period. Most of the trust's underperformance occurred in the
first half of the year. The trust made up some ground in the second half of the
year.

ECONOMIC GROWTH AIDED MUNI BOND MARKET

Municipal bonds benefited as an improving economy helped boost tax revenues.
Lower quality issues posted the biggest gains, as the yield difference between
lower quality and higher quality bonds continued to narrow--the yields on lower
quality bonds dropped more, so the prices rose more than higher quality bonds.
During the first half of the period, yields fell on municipal issues with
maturities of 10 years or longer, then climbed modestly in the second half of
the period, while yields on short-term municipal bonds rose sharply as the
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) boosted the federal funds rate -- the overnight
rate at which banks lend each other money.

GAINS FROM LOWER QUALITY, HIGHER-YIELDING BONDS

High-yield bonds were among the trust's standouts, including US Airways, Inc.
bonds (0.4% of total investments) 2, which benefited as the airline emerged from
bankruptcy in September and merged with America West Airlines, Inc. (which was
not in the portfolio). In addition, hospital bonds helped performance in the
first half of the period, while housing bonds did well in the second half.

DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM LOWER COUPON ISSUES

The trust had above-average stakes in non-callable municipal bonds, which cannot
be redeemed by the issuer before their due date, and zero coupon municipal bonds
("zeros"), which are long-term bonds that make no periodic interest payment and
are bought at a deep discount to face value. Non-callable bonds fell from
investor favor during the first half of the period and detracted from
performance. Zeros trailed the market because they tend to be very sensitive to
interest rate changes and the market began anticipating higher rates. The more
sensitive a bond is to interest rate changes, the more its price will fall as
interest rates rise, or -- conversely -- rise as interest rates fall. We trimmed
the trust's stake in both non-callable bonds and zeros, but remained overweight
in each sector.

Sector and quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of total
investments and net assets, respectively. Ratings shown in the quality
breakdowns represent the rating assigned to a particular bond by one of the
following nationally recognized rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, a division
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch
Ratings, Ltd. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards
of quality. The trust's credit quality does not remove market risk. The majority
of the bonds that are non-rated are considered by the advisor to be of
non-investment grade quality.

Because the trust is actively managed, there is no guarantee that the trust will
continue to invest in these sectors or maintain these quality breakdowns in the
future.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANAGING THE TRUST'S DIVIDEND YIELD

We continued to look for opportunities to improve the trust's income, which
aided performance as interest rates rose and bond prices fell during the second
half of the period. At the end of November 2005, about 19% of the trust's assets
were in BBB-rated securities, compared to 15% a year earlier. About 13% of the
trust's assets were in non-rated bonds at period end, compared to 11% a year
before. Bonds that are not rated by the credit ratings agencies tend to have
higher yields because they are often lower quality. However, the trust's
dividend yield declined over the 12-month period, as rising short-term interest
rates eroded some of the income the trust derives from leverage. The trust's
leverage comes from its preferred shares, which were issued in 1999 to allow the
trust to borrow against its underlying investments. We invest the proceeds from
the preferred shares in longer maturity, higher-yielding bonds, and then pay out
to preferred shareholders a short-term rate influenced by the federal funds
rate. As the federal funds rate climbed, the payout rate to preferred
shareholders rose, reducing the income available to the common shareholders. We
believe that the trust's leverage continued to give the common shareholders a
higher dividend payment than would have been available without it.

EXPECTATIONS FOR STABLE LONG-TERM YIELDS

With economic growth remaining strong at period end, we think the Fed is likely
to continue raising short-term interest rates. We believe that higher short-term
interest rates have the potential to mute inflation expectations, benefiting
longer-maturity bonds whose yields reflect an inflation premium. Yields on
long-term bonds have the potential to remain reasonably stable, while
higher-yielding bonds may continue to generate strong returns.

SHARES OF CLOSED-END FUNDS FREQUENTLY TRADE AT A DISCOUNT TO NET ASSET VALUE.
THE PRICE OF THE TRUST'S SHARES IS DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SEVERAL OF
WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE TRUST. THEREFORE, THE TRUST CANNOT PREDICT
WHETHER ITS SHARES WILL TRADE AT, BELOW OR ABOVE NET ASSET VALUE.

Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the
credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic
developments and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest
rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.

Investing in high-yield or "junk" bonds offers the potential for higher income
than investments in investment-grade bonds, but also has a higher degree of
risk. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect
a high-yield bond issuer's ability to make timely principal and interest
payments.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves
special risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Interest income
from certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes
and, if applicable, the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains are not exempt
from income taxes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

November 30, 2005

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts
business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"),
as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Trust seeks as high a level of after-tax return as is consistent with
prudent risk, by pursuing current income generally exempt from ordinary federal
income tax and opportunities for long-term appreciation from a portfolio
primarily invested in investment grade municipal bonds.

TRUST SHARES

The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the Trust's
Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal, institutional-size
trading units of similar securities. The services may use various pricing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data, as
well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations are readily
available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation. Certain
debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of lesser quality, are
priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial condition of the issuer
and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations developed through pricing
techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized upon sale of the
securities, and the potential variation may be greater for those securities
valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or have
quotations which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures
established by and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. If a
security is valued at a "fair value", such value is likely to be different from
the last quoted market price for the security.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management Advisors, LLC of the future
direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding
the variation margin recorded in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin receivable or payable
and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies portfolio
securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in an amount
equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain or loss when
the contract is closed or expires.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the Trust
to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies cash or
liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an amount equal
to the delayed delivery commitment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

November 30, 2005

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Original issue discount is
accreted to interest income over the life of the security with a corresponding
increase in the cost basis. Premium and discount are amortized and accreted,
respectively, on all debt securities. Dividend income is recorded on ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will distribute
substantially all of its taxable income, if any, for its tax year, and as such
will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust intends to
distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income,
capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that the Trust should not
be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions
to Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of
each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally
seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on November 30, 2005, was
2.90%. For the year ended November 30, 2005, the Trust declared dividends to
Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $1,333,536, representing an average
dividend rate of 2.24% per APS.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Trust's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

For the year ended November 30, 2005, permanent book and tax basis differences
resulting primarily from differing treatments for discount accretion/premium
amortization on debt securities and market discount reclassifications were
identified and reclassified among the components of the Trust's net assets as
follows:

         UNDISTRIBUTED                ACCUMULATED
     NET INVESTMENT INCOME         NET REALIZED LOSS         PAID-IN CAPITAL
    -----------------------     -----------------------     ------------------
           $(59,788)                    $59,790                    $(2)

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November 30, 2005
and November 30, 2004 was as follows:

                                        NOVEMBER 30,           NOVEMBER 30,
                                            2005                   2004
                                     ------------------     ------------------
Distributions paid from:
     Tax-Exempt Income                   $8,894,949             $8,451,630
     Ordinary Income                             --                  8,542
     Long-Term Capital Gains                     --                     --

As of November 30, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

    UNDISTRIBUTED        UNDISTRIBUTED       UNDISTRIBUTED
      TAX-EXEMPT           ORDINARY            LONG-TERM         NET UNREALIZED

       $683,420             $19,697               $--              $7,483,341

* The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized appreciation
are primarily due to discount accretion/premium amortization on debt securities.

Unrealized appreciation and depreciation at November 30, 2005, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes, was:

    Unrealized appreciation                                      $   12,557,585
    Unrealized depreciation                                          (5,074,244)
                                                                 --------------
      Net unrealized appreciation                                $    7,483,341

The following capital loss carryforwards, determined as of November 30, 2005,
may be available to reduce taxable income arising from future net realized gains
on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

                      YEAR OF                   CAPITAL LOSS

NOTE 4. FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

Columbia Management Advisors, LLC ("Columbia"), an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BOA"), is the investment advisor to
the Trust and provides administrative and other services to the Trust. Prior to
September 30, 2005, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. was the investment
advisor to the Trust under the same fee structure. On September 30, 2005,
Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. merged into Banc of America Capital
Management, LLC. At that time, the investment advisor was then renamed Columbia
Management Advisors, LLC. Columbia receives a monthly investment advisory fee at
the annual rate of 0.65% of the Trust's average weekly net assets, including
assets applicable to the APS. Effective November 1, 2005, Columbia has
voluntarily agreed to reduce the investment advisory fee by the annual rate of
0.02% of the Trust's average weekly net assets. This fee waiver can be removed
at any time.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, the total fees payable under the
pricing and bookkeeping agreement are paid to State Street.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives an
annual fee of $38,000 paid monthly plus an additional monthly fee based on the
level of average weekly net assets for the month; provided that during any
12-month period, the aggregate fee shall not exceed $140,000.

Prior to November 1, 2005, Columbia received from the Trust an annual fee of
$10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that the Trust's average weekly net
assets exceeded $50 million, an additional monthly fee, calculated by taking
into account the fees payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

The Trust also reimburses Columbia and State Street for out-of pocket expenses
and charges, including fees payable to third parties for pricing the Trust's
portfolio securities and direct internal costs incurred by Columbia in
connection with providing Trust accounting oversight and monitoring and certain
other services. For the year ended November 30, 2005, the Trust's effective
pricing and bookkeeping rate, inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses, was 0.056%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement
in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES

All officers of the Trust, with the exception of the Trust's Chief Compliance
Officer, are employees of Columbia or its affiliates and receive no compensation
from the Trust. The Board of Trustees has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer
to the Trust in accordance with federal securities regulations. The Trust, along
with other affiliated funds, pays its pro-rata share of the expenses associated
with the Chief Compliance Officer. The Trust's expenses for the Chief Compliance
Officer will not exceed $15,000 per year.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of
the Trust's assets.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the year ended November 30, 2005, the Trust paid $1,629 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the year ended November 30, 2005, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $29,492,147 and
$32,217,904, respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 2,400 APS. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At November 30, 2005,
there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Trust holds investments that are insured by private insurers who guarantee
the payment of principal and interest in the event of default or that are
supported by a letter of credit. Each of the

Trust's insurers is rated Aaa by Moody's Investor Services, Inc., except for
Radian Asset Assurance, Inc., which is rated Aa3. At November 30, 2005, private
insurers who insure greater than 5% of the total investments of the Trust were
as follows:

                                                                   % OF TOTAL

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MBIA Insurance Corp.                                                  16.2%
Ambac Assurance Corp.                                                 10.6
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.                                       6.0

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at November 30, 2005
invested in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Florida,
Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Texas and their respective political
subdivisions, agencies and public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to
economic and political factors adversely affecting issuers of the specific
state's municipal securities than are municipal bond funds that are not
concentrated to the same extent in these issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES

Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk" bonds. Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to
repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would likely
have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover, high-yield
securities may be less liquid to the extent that there is no established
secondary market.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On February 9, 2005, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (which has since merged
into Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (now named Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC)) ("Columbia") and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (which has
been renamed Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.) (the "Distributor")
(collectively, the "Columbia Group") entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance
with the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlement") and
consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") (the "SEC Order"). The SEC Order and the NYAG
Settlement are referred to collectively as the "Settlements". The Settlements
contain substantially the same terms and conditions as outlined in the
agreements in principle which Columbia Group entered into with the SEC and NYAG
in March 2004.

Under the terms of the SEC Order, the Columbia Group has agreed among other
things, to: pay $70 million in disgorgement and $70 million in civil money
penalties; cease and desist from violations of the antifraud provisions and
certain other provisions of the federal securities laws; maintain certain
compliance and ethics oversight structures; retain an independent consultant to
review the Columbia Group's applicable supervisory, compliance, control and
other policies and procedures; and retain an independent distribution consultant
(see below). The Columbia Funds have also voluntarily undertaken to implement
certain governance measures designed to maintain the independence of their
boards of trustees. The NYAG Settlement also, among other things, requires
Columbia and its affiliates to reduce certain Columbia Funds (including the
former Nations Funds) and other mutual funds management fees collectively by $32
million per year for five years, for a projected total of $160 million in
management fee reductions.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the SEC order, the $140 million in
settlement amounts described above will be distributed in accordance with a
distribution plan to be developed by an independent distribution consultant, who
is acceptable to the SEC staff and the Columbia Funds' independent trustees. The
distribution plan must be based on a methodology developed in consultation with
the Columbia Group and the funds' independent trustees and not unacceptable to
the staff of the SEC. At this time, the distribution plan is still under
development. As such, any gain to the funds or their shareholders cannot
currently be determined.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, the market price of the shares could decline.

A copy of the SEC Order is available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov. A
copy of the NYAG Settlement is available as part of the Bank of America
Corporation Form 8-K filing on February 10, 2005.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds,
FleetBoston Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of
America and its affiliated entities. More than 300 cases including those filed
against entities unaffiliated with the funds, their Boards, FleetBoston
Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of America and its
affiliated entities have been transferred to the Federal District Court in
Maryland and consolidated in a multi-district proceeding (the "MDL").

The derivative cases purportedly brought on behalf of the Columbia Funds in the
MDL have been consolidated under the lead case. The fund derivative plaintiffs
allege that the funds were harmed by market timing and late trading activity and
seek, among other things, the removal of the trustees of the Columbia Funds,
removal of the Columbia Group, disgorgement of all management fees and monetary
damages.

                                                                            | 21

November 30, 2005

On March 21, 2005, purported class action plaintiffs filed suit in Massachusetts
state court alleging that the conduct, including market timing, entitles Class B
shareholders in certain Columbia Funds to an exemption from contingent deferred
sales charges upon early redemption ("the CDSC Lawsuit"). The CDSC Lawsuit has
been removed to federal court in Massachusetts and the federal Judicial Panel
has transferred the CDSC Lawsuit to the MDL.

The MDL is ongoing. Accordingly, an estimate of the financial impact of this
litigation on any fund, if any, cannot currently be made.

In 2004, certain Columbia Funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, advisers
and affiliated entities were named as defendants in certain purported
shareholder class and derivative actions making claims, including claims under
the Investment Company and the Investment Advisers Acts of 1940 and state law.
The suits allege, inter alia, that the fees and expenses paid by the funds are
excessive and that the advisers and their affiliates inappropriately used fund
assets to distribute the funds and for other improper purposes. On March 2,
2005, the actions were consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as In re
Columbia Entities Litigation. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint on June 9, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the judge dismissed all claims
by plaintiffs and ordered that the case be closed. The plaintiffs filed a notice
of appeal on December 30, 2005.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE TRUSTEES AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL
TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Colonial Investment Grade Municipal
Trust (the "Trust") at November 30, 2005, and the results of its operations, the
changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the periods
indicated, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Trust's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
November 30, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION

100.00% of distributions from net investment income will be treated as exempt
income for federal income tax purposes.

For the calendar year ended December 31, 2005, 12.97% of distributions from net
investment income is subject to the alternative minimum tax.

                                                                            | 27

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL TRUST

Pursuant to the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all
shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
distributions reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Trust by
Computershare (the "Plan Agent") unless a shareholder elects to receive cash.
Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee will have
distributions reinvested automatically by the broker or nominee in additional
shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the broker or the
nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash. If the
service is not available, such distributions will be paid in cash. Shareholders
whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact the
broker or nominee for details. All distributions to shareholders who elect not
to participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed directly to the
shareholder of record on the record date therefore by the Plan Agent as the
dividend disbursing agent.

Non-participants in the Plan will receive distributions in cash. Distributions
payable to participants in the Plan will be applied by the Plan Agent, acting as
agent for Plan participants, to the purchase of shares of the Trust. Such shares
will be purchased by the Plan Agent at the then current market price of such
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to his
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's notice of election
to withdraw from the Plan must be received by the Plan Agent before the record
date for a dividend in order to be given effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting distributions. The Plan
Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of distributions will be paid
by the Trust. Each participant in the Plan will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of distributions. Purchase orders
from the participants in the Plan may be combined with those of other
participants and the price paid by any particular participant may be the average
of the price paid on various orders executed on behalf of groups of participants
in the Plan.

The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of any
income tax that may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
Computershare by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, or by phone
at 1-800-730-6001.

(1)   In December 2000, the boards of each of the former Liberty Funds and
      former Stein Roe Funds were combined into one board of trustees
      responsible for the oversight of both fund groups (collectively, the
      "Liberty Board"). In October 2003, the trustees on the Liberty Board were
      elected to the boards of the Columbia Funds (the "Columbia Board") and of
      the CMG Fund Trust (the "CMG Funds Board"); simultaneous with that
      election, Patrick J. Simpson and Richard L. Woolworth, who had been
      directors on the Columbia Board and trustees on the CMG Funds Board, were
      appointed to serve as trustees of the Liberty Board. The date shown is the
      earliest date on which a trustee/director was elected or appointed to the
      board of a Fund in the Columbia Funds Complex.

(2)   Mr. Mayer is an "interested person" (as defined in the Investment Company
      Act of 1940 (1940 Act)) by reason of his affiliation with WR Hambrecht +
      Co.

      Liberty All-Star Funds, currently consisting of 2 funds, which are advised
      by an affiliate of the Advisor.

      2003.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Advisory Fees and Expenses Committee of the Board of Trustees meets one or
more times annually, usually in late summer, to review the advisory agreements
(collectively, the "Agreements") of the funds for which the Trustees serve as
trustees or directors (each a "fund") and determine whether to recommend that
the full Board approve the continuation of the Agreements for an additional
one-year period. After the Committee has made its recommendation, the full
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determines whether to approve the
continuation of the Agreements. In addition, the Board, including the
Independent Trustees, considers matters bearing on the Agreements at most of its
other meetings throughout the year and meets regularly with the heads of each
investment area within Columbia. The Trustees also meet with selected fund
portfolio managers at various times throughout the year. The Trustees receive
and review all materials that they, their legal counsel or Columbia, the funds'
investment adviser, believe to be reasonably necessary for the Trustees to
evaluate the Agreements and determine whether to approve the continuation of the
Agreements. Those materials generally include, among other items, (i)
information on the investment performance of each fund relative to the
performance of peer groups of mutual funds and the fund's performance
benchmarks, (ii) information on each fund's advisory fees and other expenses,
including information comparing the fund's expenses to those of peer groups of
mutual funds and information about any applicable expense caps and fee
"breakpoints," (iii) sales and redemption data, (iv) information about the
profitability of the Agreements to Columbia, and potential "fall-out" or
ancillary benefits that Columbia and its affiliates may receive as a result of
their relationships with the funds and (v) information obtained through
Columbia's response to a questionnaire prepared at the request of the Trustees
by counsel to the funds and independent legal counsel to the Independent
Trustees. The Trustees also consider other information such as (vi) Columbia's
financial results and financial condition, (vii) each fund's investment
objective and strategies and the size, education and experience of Columbia's
investment staffs and their use of technology, external research and trading
cost measurement tools, (viii) the allocation of the funds' brokerage, if any,
including allocations to brokers affiliated with Columbia and the use of "soft"
commission dollars to pay fund expenses and to pay for research products and
services, (ix) Columbia's resources devoted to, and its record of compliance
with, the funds' investment policies and restrictions, policies on personal
securities transactions and other compliance policies, (x) Columbia's response
to various legal and regulatory proceedings since 2003 and (xi) the economic
outlook generally and for the mutual fund industry in particular. In addition,
the Trustees confer with their independent fee consultant and review materials
relating to the Agreements that the independent fee consultant provides.
Throughout the process, the Trustees have the opportunity to ask questions of
and request additional materials from Columbia and to consult independent legal
counsel to the Independent Trustees.

The Board of Trustees most recently approved the continuation of the Agreements
at its October, 2005 meeting, following meetings of the Advisory Fees and
Expenses Committee held in August, September, and October, 2005. In considering
whether to approve the continuation of the Agreements, the Trustees, including
the Independent Trustees, did not identify any single factor as determinative,
and each weighed various factors as he or she deemed appropriate. The Trustees
considered the following matters in connection with their approval of the
continuation of the Agreements: THE NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES
PROVIDED TO THE FUNDS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. The Trustees considered the nature,
extent and quality of the services provided by Columbia and its affiliates to
the funds and the resources dedicated to the funds by Columbia and its
affiliates. Among other things, the Trustees considered (i) Columbia's ability,
including its resources, compensation programs for personnel involved in fund
management, reputation and other attributes, to attract and retain highly
qualified research, advisory and supervisory investment professionals; (ii) the
portfolio management services provided by those investment professionals; and
(iii) the trade execution services provided on behalf of the funds. For each
fund, the Trustees also considered the benefits to shareholders of investing in
a mutual fund that is part of a family of funds offering exposure to a variety
of asset classes and investment disciplines and providing for a variety of fund
and shareholder services. After reviewing those and related factors, the
Trustees concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding
each of the Agreements, that the nature, extent and quality of services provided
supported the continuation of the Agreements. INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE
FUNDS AND COLUMBIA. The Trustees reviewed information about the performance of
each fund over various time periods, including information prepared by an
independent third party that compared the performance of each fund to the
performance of peer groups of mutual funds and performance benchmarks. The
Trustees also reviewed a description of the third party's methodology for
identifying each fund's peer group for purposes of performance and expense
comparisons. The Trustees also considered additional information that the

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Fees and Expenses Committee requested from Columbia relating to funds
that presented relatively weaker performance and/or relatively higher expenses.
In the case of each fund that had performance that lagged that of a relevant
peer group for certain (although not necessarily all) periods, the Trustees
concluded that other factors relevant to performance were sufficient, in light
of other considerations, to warrant continuation of the fund's Agreements. Those
factors varied from fund to fund, but included one or more of the following: (i)
that the fund's performance, although lagging in certain recent periods, was
stronger over the longer term; (ii) that the underperformance was attributable,
to a significant extent, to investment decisions that were reasonable and
consistent with the fund's investment strategy and policies and that the fund
was performing as expected, given market conditions and the fund's investment
strategy; (iii) that the fund's performance was competitive when compared to
other relevant performance benchmarks or peer groups; (iv) that Columbia had
taken or was taking steps designed to help improve the fund's investment
performance, including, but not limited to, replacing portfolio managers or
modifying investment strategies; (v) that the fund's advisory fee had recently
been, or was proposed to be, reduced, with the goal of helping the fund's net
return to shareholders become more competitive; and (vi) that other fund
expenses, such as transfer agency or fund accounting fees, have recently been
reduced, with the goal of helping the fund's net return to shareholders become
more competitive. The Trustees also considered Columbia's performance and
reputation generally, the funds' performance as a fund family generally, and
Columbia's historical responsiveness to Trustee concerns about performance and
Columbia's willingness to take steps intended to improve performance. After
reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the context
of their overall conclusions regarding each of the Agreements, that the
performance of each fund and Columbia was sufficient, in light of other
considerations, to warrant the continuation of the Agreements. THE COSTS OF THE
SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROFITS REALIZED BY COLUMBIA AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FUNDS. The Trustees considered the fees charged to the
funds for advisory services as well as the total expense levels of the funds.
That information included comparisons (provided both by management and by an
independent third party) of the funds' advisory fees and total expense levels to
those of their peer groups and information about the advisory fees charged by
Columbia to comparable accounts. In considering the fees charged to comparable
accounts, the Trustees took into account, among other things, management's
representations about the differences between managing mutual funds as compared
to other types of accounts, including the additional resources required to
effectively manage mutual funds and distribute mutual fund shares. In evaluating
each fund's advisory fees, the Trustees also took into account the demands,
complexity and quality of the investment management of the fund. The Trustees
considered reductions in advisory fee rates, implementation of advisory fee
breakpoints, institution of advisory fee waivers, and changes to expense caps,
which benefited a number of the funds. Furthermore, the Trustees considered the
projected impact on expenses resulting from the overall cost reductions that
management anticipated would result from the shift to a common group of service
providers for transfer agency, fund accounting and custody services for mutual
funds advised by Bank of America affiliates. The Trustees also noted
management's stated justification for the fees charged to the funds, which
included information about the performance of the funds, the services provided
to the funds and management's view as to why it was appropriate that some funds
bear advisory fees or total expenses greater than their peer group medians. The
Trustees also considered the compensation directly or indirectly received by
Columbia and its affiliates from their relationships with the funds. The
Trustees reviewed information provided by management as to the profitability to
Columbia and its affiliates of their relationships with the funds, and
information about the allocation of expenses used to calculate profitability.
When reviewing profitability, the Trustees also considered court cases in which
adviser profitability was an issue in whole or in part, the performance of the
relevant funds, the expense levels of the funds, and whether Columbia had
implemented breakpoints and/or expense caps with respect to the funds.

After reviewing those and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
context of their overall conclusions regarding each of the Agreements, that the
advisory fees charged to each of the funds were fair and reasonable, and that
the costs of the advisory services generally, and the related profitability to
Columbia and its affiliates of their relationships with the funds, supported the
continuation of the Agreements.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Trustees considered the existence of any economies of
scale in the provision of services by Columbia to each fund and whether those
economies were shared with the fund through breakpoints in the investment
advisory fees or other means, such as expense waivers. The Trustees noted that
many of the funds benefited from breakpoints, expense caps, or both. In

                                                                            | 33

<PAGE>


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

considering those issues, the Trustees also took note of the costs of the
services provided (both on an absolute and a relative basis) and the
profitability to Columbia and its affiliates of their relationships with the
funds, as discussed above. After reviewing those and related factors, the
Trustees concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding
each of the Agreements, that the extent to which economies of scale were shared
with the funds supported the continuation of the Agreements.

OTHER FACTORS. The Trustees also considered other factors, which included but
were not limited to the following:

o     the extent to which each fund had operated in accordance with its
      investment objective and its record of compliance with its investment
      restrictions, and the compliance programs of the funds and Columbia. They
      also considered the compliance-related resources that Columbia and its
      affiliates were providing to the funds.

o     the nature, quality, cost and extent of administrative and shareholder
      services performed by Columbia and its affiliates, both under the
      Agreements and under separate agreements for the provision of transfer
      agency and administrative services.

o     so-called "fall-out benefits" to Columbia, such as the engagement of its
      affiliates to provide distribution, brokerage and transfer agency services
      to the funds, and the benefits of research made available to Columbia by
      reason of brokerage commissions generated by the funds' securities
      transactions, as well as possible conflicts of interest associated with
      those fall-out and other benefits, and the reporting, disclosure and other
      processes in place to disclose and monitor those possible conflicts of
      interest.

o     the draft report provided by the independent fee consultant, which
      included information about and analysis of the funds' fees, expenses and
      performance.

Based on their evaluation of all factors that they deemed to be material,
including those factors described above, and assisted by the advice of
independent counsel and the independent fee consultant, the Trustees, including
the Independent Trustees, approved the continuance of each of the Agreements
through November 30, 2006.

SUMMARY OF MANAGEMENT FEE EVALUATION BY INDEPENDENT FEE CONSULTANT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    PREPARED PURSUANT TO THE FEBRUARY 9, 2005
                           ASSURANCE OF DISCONTINUANCE
                              BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF
                     ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK STATE AND
                     COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT ADVISORS, INC. AND
                        COLUMBIA FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR, INC.

                                OCTOBER 11, 2005

I. OVERVIEW

Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("CMA") and Columbia Funds Distributors, Inc.
("CFD") (CFD together with CMA referred to herein as Columbia Management Group
or "CMG1"), entered into an agreement with the New York Attorney General's
Office in the form of an Assurance of Discontinuance (the "AOD"). The AOD
stipulated that CMA would be permitted to manage or advise the Columbia Funds
only if the Independent Members (as such term is defined in the AOD) of the
Columbia Funds' Board of Trustees/Directors (collectively the "Trustees")
appointed a Senior Officer or an Independent Fee Consultant ("IFC") who, among
other things, is to manage the process by which management fees are negotiated.
On May 15, 2005, the Independent Members of the Board appointed me as the IFC
for the Columbia Funds. This report is the annual written evaluation of the
Columbia Funds for 2005 that I have prepared in my capacity as IFC, as required
by the AOD.

A. DUTIES OF THE INDEPENDENT FEE CONSULTANT

As part of the AOD, the Independent Members of the Columbia Funds' Board of
Trustees/Directors agreed to retain an independent fee consultant who was to
participate in the management fee negotiation process. The IFC is charged with
"... duties and responsibilities [that] include managing the process by which
proposed management fees (including, but not limited to, advisory fees) to be
charged the Columbia Fund[s] are negotiated so that they are negotiated in a
manner which is at arms length and reasonable and consistent with this Assurance
of Discontinuance." However, the IFC does not replace the Trustees in their role
of negotiating management and other fees with CMG and its affiliates. In
particular, the AOD states that "Columbia Advisors may manage or advise a
Columbia Fund only if the reasonableness of the proposed management fees is
determined by the Board of Trustees of the Columbia Fund using ... an annual
independent written evaluation prepared by or under the direction of the ...
Independent Fee Consultant...." This report, pursuant to the AOD, constitutes
the "annual independent written evaluation prepared by or under the direction of
the... Independent Fee Consultant."

The AOD requires the IFC report to consider at least the following:

a) Management fees (including any components thereof) charged by other mutual
fund companies for like services;

b) Management fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional
and other clients of CMA for like services;

c) Costs to CMA and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the
management fee agreements, excluding any intra-corporate profit;

d) Profit margins of CMA and its affiliates from supplying such services;

e) Possible economies of scale as the CMA fund grows larger; and

f) The nature and quality of CMA services, including Columbia Funds'
performance.

This report is designed to assist the Board in evaluating the 2005 contract
renewal for Columbia Funds. In addition, this report points out areas where the
Board may deem additional information and analysis to be appropriate over time.

B. SOURCES OF INFORMATION USED IN MY EVALUATION

I have requested data from CMG and various third party industry data sources or
independent research companies that work in the mutual fund arena. The following
list generally describes the types of information I requested.

1. I collected data on performance, management fees, and expense ratios of both
Columbia Funds and comparable non-Columbia Funds. The sources of this
information were CMG, Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") and Morningstar Inc.
("Morningstar"). While Lipper and Morningstar each selected a different group of
peer funds it deemed appropriate against which to measure the relative
performance and fees of Columbia Funds, I conducted an independent review of the
appropriateness of each peer group.

2. I reviewed data on CMG's expense and profitability that I obtained from CMA
directly.

3. I have reviewed data on the organizational structure of CMG in general.

4. I collected information on profitability from Strategic Insight Mutual Fund
Research and Consulting, LLC ("Strategic Insight"). I used this third-party
independent research as an additional method to gauge the accuracy of the data
collected in (2) above.

1     Prior to the date of this report, CMA merged into an affiliated entity,
      Banc of America Capital Management, LLC ("BACAP"), and BACAP then changed
      its name to Columbia Management Advisors, LLC which carries on the
      business of CMA, and CFD changed its name to Columbia Management
      Distributors, Inc.

                                                                            | 35

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. I conducted interviews with various CMG staff, including members of the
senior management team, legal staff, heads of affiliates, portfolio managers,
and financial personnel.

6. I reviewed current 2005 Section 15(c) material provided to the Board and
material presented to the Board in the 2004 fee and performance evaluation.

7. I have reviewed various academic research papers, industry publications, and
other available literature dealing with mutual fund operations, profitability,
and other issues. In addition, I have reviewed SEC releases and studies of
mutual fund expenses.

8. I have reviewed documents pertaining to recent mutual fund litigation in
general and publicly available information about litigation where CMG has been
involved.

In addition, I have engaged NERA Economic Consulting ("NERA") and independent
consultant Dr. John Rea to assist me in data management and analysis. Both NERA
and Dr. Rea have extensive experience in the mutual fund industry through
consulting, government positions, or industry trade groups that provide unique
insights and special knowledge pertaining to my independent analysis of fees,
performance, and profitability. I have also retained Shearman & Sterling LLP as
outside counsel to advise me in connection with my review.

C. QUALIFICATIONS AND INDEPENDENCE

I am the Walter H. Carpenter Chair and Professor of Finance at Babson College.
Before this I was the Chief Economist of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. I have no material relationship with Bank of America or CMG aside
from acting as IFC, and am aware of no relationship with any of their
affiliates. [Resume omitted]

II. EVALUATION OF THE GENERAL PROCESS USED TO NEGOTIATE THE ADVISORY CONTRACT

A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

My analysis considered all factors and information I reviewed on the finances
and operations of Columbia Funds. I gave each factor an appropriate weight in my
overall findings, and no single factor was in itself the sole criterion for a
finding or conclusion. My objective was to assess all of the information
provided and conduct a robust evaluation of Columbia Funds' operations, fees,
and performance.

My analysis and thought processes will and, I believe, should, differ in certain
ways from the processes used by Trustees in their evaluation of the management
agreements. In particular, because of my technical and quantitative background,
I may use techniques and data that Trustees have not previously felt would be
useful. I view this supplemental analysis as appropriate because my role is to
assist Trustees in their decisions, and to the extent that I bring new ideas or
analysis to the evaluation, I believe this improves the process by which
management fees for the Columbia Funds may be negotiated in accordance with the
AOD.

Finally, as part of my role as IFC, I have, from time to time, sent to Trustees
additional papers and reports produced by third parties that I felt had bearing
on the fee negotiation process. I viewed these materials as educational in
nature and felt they would aid Trustees in placing their work in context.

B. CMG MANAGEMENT INTERVIEWS

As a starting point of my analysis, I have met with members of CMG staff to gain
an understanding of the organizational structure and personnel involved in
running the Columbia fund family.

I have had general discussions and have received information about the
management structure of CMG. My conversations with management have been
informative. In addition, I have participated in Board meetings where Trustees
and management have discussed issues relating to management agreements and
performance of Columbia Funds. When I felt it was appropriate, I added my
opinions on particular matters, such as fund performance or fee levels, to the
discussion.

C. TRUSTEES' FEE AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCESS

After making initial requests for information, members of the Trustees of the
Columbia Funds met in advance of the October Section 15(c) contract approval
meeting to review certain fee, performance and other data for the Columbia Funds
and to ask questions and make requests of management. Trustees have developed a
process to evaluate the fee and expense levels and performance of Columbia
Funds. This process is used to highlight those funds that have been performing
poorly, may have had higher management fees or expense ratios, or both.

The process involves providing instructions to Lipper to prepare specific data
analyses tailored to the Trustees review framework. These instructions include
highlighting funds that hit one or more fee performance "screens." The six
screens the Trustees use are as follows:

a. 5th Lipper quintile in actual management fee;

b. 5th Lipper quintile in total expense ratio;

c. Three or more 5th Lipper quintile rankings in the 1-, 3-, 5- or 10-year
performance rankings;

d. Sum of the Lipper Quintile Rank (1-year performance) and the Lipper Quintile
Rank (actual management fee) totals a number equal to or higher than 8;

e. Sum of the Lipper Quintile Rank (1-year performance) and the Lipper Quintile
Rank (total expense ratio) totals a number equal to or higher than 8; and

36 |

<PAGE>


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

f. Sum of the Lipper Quintile Rank (3-year performance) and the Lipper Quintile
Rank (total expense ratio) totals a number equal to or higher than 8.

If a fund hits one or more of these screens, it is highlighted for additional
review by the Trustees. This method is only used as an aid for Trustees to
highlight funds and is not the sole test of whether the Board will determine to
take particular actions concerning fees or performance. Funds that have not been
flagged by this screen also may be singled out for fee and performance reasons,
and the Trustees may determine not to take action with respect to the fees or
performance of funds that have been flagged by the screen. These screens
contribute to the basis for discussions on Trustees' views on the Columbia
Funds.

III. FINDINGS

My findings based on my work as IFC are as follows:

1. The Trustees have the relevant information necessary to form an opinion on
the reasonableness of fees and evaluate the performance of the Columbia Funds.
The process the Trustees used in preparing to reach their determination has been
open and informative. In my view, the 2005 process by which the management fees
of the Columbia Funds have been negotiated thus far has been, to the extent
practicable, at arm's length and reasonable and consistent with the AOD.

2. Columbia Funds demonstrated a range of performance relative to their peers. I
find that across the fund complex, 54.26 percent of Columbia Funds have
performance higher than the median of their respective Lipper performance
universe, and 42.55 percent of Columbia Funds have performance higher than the
median of their respective Lipper performance group. In addition, Lipper
performance universe and group comparison showed that Columbia Funds were
distributed roughly evenly across these quintiles. The Trustees have worked with
management to address issues of funds that have demonstrated consistent or
significant underperformance.

3. Columbia Funds demonstrate a range of management fees and expense ratios
relative to their peers. I find that across the fund complex, 58.51 percent of
Columbia Funds have expenses below the median of their Lipper expense universe,
and 53.19 percent of Columbia Funds have expenses below the median of their
Lipper expense group. In addition, Lipper expense universe and group comparisons
show that Columbia Funds are distributed roughly evenly across these quintiles.
The Trustees have taken steps to limit shareholder expenses for certain funds
having management fees significantly above their peers, often though the use of
fee waivers to which CMG has agreed.

Consolidation of various funds and fund families managed by CMG has resulted in
substantial savings in non-advisory expenses.

4. Profitability to CMG of the individual funds ranges widely, but the overall
profitability to CMG of its relationship with the Columbia Funds appears to fall
within a reasonable range. The method of cost allocation to funds is addressed
in the material provided by CMG to the Trustees, but additional information may
be necessary to make a judgment on fund level profitability. My review of
profitability and cost allocation is ongoing, and I plan to continue to develop
my views with regard to fund level profitability.

5. Columbia Funds have instituted fee schedules with breakpoints designed to
enable investors to benefit from fund economies of scale, although 71% of the
funds have not yet reached their first breakpoint. My analysis of the
appropriateness of the breakpoint levels, which I expect will take into account
the cost and profitability of the individual funds, is ongoing.

My work is ongoing and my views may develop over time in light of new
information and analysis.

Respectfully submitted,
Erik R. Sirri

(e)(1) AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the "Policy")
which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which the Audit
Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit (including audit related,
tax and all other) services provided by the registrant's independent auditor to
the registrant and individual funds

<PAGE>

(collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all non-audit services provided by the
registrant's independent auditor to the funds' adviser or a control affiliate of
the adviser, that relate directly to the funds' operations and financial
reporting (collectively "Fund-related Adviser Services"). A "control affiliate"
is an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
adviser that provides ongoing services to the funds, and the term "adviser" is
deemed to exclude any unaffiliated sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio
management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser. The
adviser and control affiliates are collectively referred to as "Adviser
Entities."

The Audit Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case basis as
potential services are contemplated) and general (pre-determined list of
permitted services) pre-approvals. Unless a type of service has received general
pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it
is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The Policy does not delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration
shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general pre-approval.

These schedules will provide a description of each type of service that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide estimated fees
for each instance of providing each service. This general pre-approval and
related fees (where provided) will generally cover a one-year period (for
example, from June 1 through May 31 of the following year). The Audit Committee
will review and approve the types of services and review the projected fees for
the next one-year period and may add to, or subtract from, the list of general
pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.
This approval acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the
specific types of services that the independent auditor will be permitted to
perform. The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary at other
regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has the
authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate amount of non-audit services
provided to an individual fund.

If, subsequent to general pre-approval, a fund, its investment adviser or a
control affiliate determines that it would like to engage the independent
auditor to perform a service that requires pre-approval and that is not included
in the general pre-approval list, the specific pre-approval procedure shall be
as follows:

<PAGE>

     o    A brief written request shall be prepared by management detailing the
          proposed engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed to
          be performed by the independent auditor;

     o    The request should be addressed to the Audit Committee with copies to
          the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;

     o    The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will
          arrange for a discussion of the service to be included on the agenda
          for the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, when the
          Committee will discuss the proposed engagement and approve or deny the
          request.

     o    If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
          commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairperson
          of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of
          the Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine to
          call a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of
          considering the proposal. Should the Chairperson of the Audit
          Committee be unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee may
          serve as an alternate for the purpose of approving or denying the
          request. Discussion with the Chairperson (or alternate, if necessary)
          will be arranged by the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee
          Administration. The independent auditor will not commence any such
          project unless and until specific approval has been given.

III. CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed to
be provided by the independent auditor to the adviser or control affiliates are
not Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of the Policy, but
nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing evaluation of the
auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its audit services to the
funds. As a result, in all cases where an Adviser Entity engages the independent
auditor to provide audit or non-audit services that are not Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit
Committee, and the projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of
all such engagements during the period covered by the Policy) exceeds a
pre-determined threshold established by the Audit Committee; the independent
auditor, Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will notify
the Audit Committee not later than its next meeting. Such notification shall
include a general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be
the recipient of such services, the timing of the engagement, the entity's
reasons for selecting the independent auditor, and the projected fees. Such
information will allow the Audit Committee to consider whether non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject to
Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the auditor's
independence with respect to the Funds.

IV. REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

<PAGE>

The Fund Treasurer or Director of Trustee Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services or
Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was rendered,
including:

     o    A general description of the services, and

     o    Actual billed and projected fees, and

     o    The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser Services
          were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

In addition, the independent auditor shall report to the Audit Committee
annually, and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the
SEC, all non-audit services provided to entities in the funds' "investment
company complex," as defined by SEC rules, that did not require pre-approval
under the Policy.

V. AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Policy may be amended from time to time by the Audit Committee. Prompt
notice of any amendments will be provided to the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee Administration. The Policy shall be reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

                                      *****

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
this Item approved pursuant to the "de minimis" exception under paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during both fiscal years ended
November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004 was zero.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2005 and
November 30, 2004 are disclosed in (b) through (d) of this Item.

During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, there
were no Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees or All Other Fees that were approved for
services to the investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant under
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

The percentage of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees required to be
approved under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X that were
approved under the "de minimis" exception during both fiscal years ended
November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004 was zero.

<PAGE>

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X, is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence. The Audit Committee determined that the provision of such services
is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit committee established
in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(58)(A)). Douglas A. Hacker, Thomas E. Stitzel, Anne-Lee Verville and
Richard L. Woolworth are each independent trustees and collectively constitute
the entire Audit Committee.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

The registrant's "Schedule I - Investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers" (as set forth in 17 CFR 210.12-12) is included in Item 1 of this Form
N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Columbia Management Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") the
responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the
Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the Board of
Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and procedures adopted
by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the Advisor follows when a
vote presents a conflict between the interests of the Fund and its shareholders
and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its
other clients or other persons. The Advisor examines each proposal and votes
against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the proposal
would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of
the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each proposal and votes the
proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the proposal would be
expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund. The Advisor
determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the potential economic
return on the Fund's investment.

<PAGE>

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines. For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines the
vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any benefit to
the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. The Advisor's
Proxy Committee is composed of representatives of the Advisor's equity
investments, equity research, compliance, legal and fund administration
functions. In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Proxy
Committee has the responsibility to review, on a semi-annual basis, the
Advisor's proxy voting policies to ensure consistency with internal and
regulatory agency policies and to develop additional predetermined voting
guidelines to assist in the review of proxy proposals.

The Proxy Committee may vary from a predetermined guideline if it determines
that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined guideline would be
expected to impact adversely the current or potential market value of the
issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best interest of the client.
References to the best interest of a client refer to the interest of the client
in terms of the potential economic return on the client's investment. In
determining the vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any
benefit other than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted. A member
of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for which he or
she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship with the
issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to disclose
to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or other matter
known to the person that would create a potential conflict of interest.

The Advisor has retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third
party vendor, to implement its proxy voting process. ISS provides proxy
analysis, record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

<DESCRIPTION>CODE OF ETHICS
<TEXT>

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

          This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
     the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the "Funds" and
     each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal Executive Officer,
     Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, and Director of
     Trustee Administration (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of
     promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in other public communications
          made by a Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of business
     ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

          The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
     (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be primarily
     responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). The
     Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management Group Compliance
     Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his or her designee shall
     serve as the Code Officer, but only on a temporary basis.

          Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief Legal
     Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
     promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund shall assist the
     Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Chief Legal Officer
     shall be responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
     questions are presented under it (in consultation with Fund counsel, where
     appropriate) and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular
     situation. However, any


<PAGE>

     waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
     Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

III. MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

          OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
     private interest interferes with the interests of, or his/her service to, a
     Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
     or a family member, receives improper personal benefits as a result of the
     Covered Officer's position with a Fund.

          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
     Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
     provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Company Act") and
     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"). For example,
     Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such
     as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with a Fund
     because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and
     its investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
     prevent, or identify and correct, violations of those provisions. This Code
     does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those programs and
     procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

          Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
     benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
     relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser, administrator,
     principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
     (each, a "Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
     officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
     Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
     Fund or for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing
     policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
     Service Provider and a Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in
     such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the
     Fund and the Service Provider and is consistent with the performance by the
     Covered Officers of their duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is
     recognized by the Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
     employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or
     other codes.

          Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
     conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the Company Act and
     the Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
     interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that
     these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
     personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly
     before the interest of a Fund.

<PAGE>

          Each Covered Officer must:


          o    not use personal influence or personal relationships improperly
               to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by a
               Fund whereby the Covered Officer or an immediate family member
               would benefit personally to the detriment of a Fund; and

          o    not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action,  for the
               individual   personal  benefit  of  the  Covered  Officer  or  an
               immediate family member rather than the benefit of the Fund.1.

          There are some conflict of interest situations that must be approved
     by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief Legal Officer. Those
     situations include, but are not limited to,:

          o    service as director on the board of any public or private
               company;

          o    the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the aggregate from
               a third party that does or seeks to do business with the Funds
               during any 12-month period;

          o    the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a
               Fund has current or prospective business dealings, unless such
               entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
               appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise
               any question of impropriety;

          o    any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or
               employment relationship with, any Fund service providers, other
               than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator
               or any affiliated person thereof;

          o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
               transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting
               portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
               than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment,
               such as compensation or equity ownership.

IV.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

          Each Covered Officer shall:

          o    be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally applicable
               to the Funds;

          o    not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
               facts about any Fund to others, whether within or outside the
               Fund,

- --------------------
(1) For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered Officers
shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<PAGE>

               including to the Fund's trustees and auditors, and to
               governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

          o    to the extent appropriate within his/her area of responsibility,
               consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and the
               adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely
               and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
               Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
               communications made by the Funds; and

          o    promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

          Each Covered Officer must:

          o    upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered Officer),
               affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has received, read and
               understands the Code;

          o    annually affirm to the Board compliance with the requirements of
               the Code;

          o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee
               of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential
               violations that are made in good faith;

          o    notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer promptly if
               he/she knows of any violation of this Code; and

          o    respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires circulated
               periodically in connection with the preparation of disclosure
               documents for the Funds.


     The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities related to this
Code.

          The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating
     and enforcing this Code:

          o    The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will take all
               appropriate action to investigate any potential violation
               reported to him/her;

          o    If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and the
               Code Officer believes that no violation has occurred, the Code
               Officer will notify the person(s) reporting the potential
               violation, and no further action is required;

          o    Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer
               believes is a violation will be reported to the Audit Committee;

          o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it
               will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
               consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
               appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
               notification to the

<PAGE>

               Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or a
               recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered Officer;

          o    The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers in
               its sole discretion;

          o    Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
               required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

          The Chief Legal Officer shall:

          o    report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals provided in
               accordance with Section III of this Code; and

          o    report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations of, or
               material issues arising under, this Code.

VI.  OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
     the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
     forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as
     other polices or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers
     govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities (including, but not
     limited to, personal trading activities) of the Covered Officers who are
     subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that
     they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and
     their investment advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of ethics
     under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and any policies and procedures of
     the Service Providers are separate requirements applicable to the Covered
     Officers and are not part of this Code.

VII. AMENDMENTS

          All material amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by
     the Board, including a majority of independent directors.

VIII. CONFIDENTIALITY

          All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
     will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
     accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
     shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Board, the Covered
     Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code Officer, outside audit firms
     and legal counsel to the Funds, and senior management of Columbia
     Management Group.

IX.  INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
     not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
     circumstance, or legal conclusion.
