LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 August 25, 2003
Dear Shareholder,
   The German equity market staged a major rebound from its low point reached on
March 12, 2003. Stock market sentiment has substantially improved due to reduced
uncertainties  related to the Iraq war and investors are refocusing once more on
fundamentals,  such as valuations and growth.  Another important factor has been
Chancellor Schroeder's proposed reform program, the so-called "Agenda 2010". Its
most important aim is to increase the German economy's  competitiveness and thus
reduce unemployment. Additionally, the German government announced its intention
to bring forward major income tax cuts to stimulate  consumption.  Finally,  the
European  Central Bank continued its easy monetary policy stance by reducing its
benchmark rate to 2%.
   For the six months ended June 30, 2003,  the net asset value per share of the
New Germany Fund increased 36.9% and its share price increased 38.9%,  while the
Fund's benchmark,  the Midcap Market Performance Index, increased by 29.0% in US
dollar terms during the same period.  Second quarter returns were  exceptionally
strong with the Fund's net asset value up by 34.5%, its share price up 39.3% and
the Mid Cap Market Index up 35.0%.
   As in previous  quarters,  performance  of the New Germany Fund was driven by
stock selection and  company-specific  news flow.  During the second quarter the
Fund sold its entire holding in Wella after P&G took a controlling  stake in the
company. In the financial sector, positions in the banking and insurance sectors
were  increased  due to  favorable  valuations  and the fact  that the  European
Central Bank  signaled its  willingness  to further cut interest  rates.  Buying
positions in EADS, MG Technologies and Rheinmetall increased the Fund's exposure
to the machinery and industrial sectors. Rheinmetall is expected to benefit from
a restructuring  program while MG Technologies trades at a significant  discount
to its sum-of-the-parts  valuation.  We are basing our EADS position on expected
profit  from strong  order  flows and revenue  growth as some of the key defense
programs  move into  production.  Overall  the  midcap  segment  still  enjoys a
valuation advantage over the large-cap segment and forward P/E's of 12 times for
2004 still seem reasonable.
   The New Germany  Fund  continued  its  open-market  purchases  of its shares,
buying 274,900  shares during the first six months of 2003. The Fund's  discount
to its net asset value averaged 20.9% during this period.

                           Sincerely,

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   QUESTION:  What makes you think that the "Agenda  2010"  reform  package will
actually go through in its entirety,  without being diluted by special  interest
groups?

   ANSWER:  "Reform"  has  certainly  become  one of the most  cliched  words in
Germany today.  In view of lame growth,  stubbornly  rising  unemployment  and a
social  security  system  beset with major  financing  problems,  there is broad
consensus  about the fact that  something  has to change.  The "Agenda  2010" is
certainly not a concept that will solve Germany's  structural  problems once and
for all,  but it  represents  a major turn around from the vantage  point of the
left-wing party base and parts of the trade unions. Mr. Schroeder has linked his
political fate to the Agenda,  and it seems that he has gained the upper hand in
his own party.  The proposed reform package  received the blessing of around 90%
of the delegates at the Social Democratic Party's  extraordinary  party congress
in Berlin  on June 1st  after a fierce  debate  and some  concessions  regarding
transition  periods  for  unemployment  payments  and the special  situation  of
Eastern  Germany.  Interestingly,  the opposition  has already  signaled that it
might support Mr. Schroeder's reform package,  as long as the key issues are not
watered down and reform continues.

   QUESTION: Assuming the reform is on track, what are some of the key proposals
in Chancellor  Schroeder's  proposed reform program and how would it benefit the
German economy?

   ANSWER:  The core of the reform measures is that the state healthcare  system
will no longer pay for certain  benefits,  and going  forward it will have to be
financed either by the beneficiaries themselves or by the taxpayer. Higher extra
payments for drugs and visits to the doctor and measures to increase competition
among medical  providers and pharmacies should lead to a reduction in healthcare
expenditures.  It is estimated  that the overall cost to the  healthcare  system
could be  reduced by about Euro 20 bn,  which is  equivalent  to about 2% of the
total  contributions to the state  healthcare  system.  Currently,  contribution
rates average around 14.3%,  and paid in equal parts by employers and employees.
Therefore  employers  would benefit most,  as their  non-wage  labor costs would
decline in line with the cut. In addition to health care  reform,  the  proposal
includes a provision  for labor  market and old-age  pension  reform.  The labor
market reform includes a major cut in unemployment benefits in order to increase
the incentive to find a job and to bring  financial  relief to the  unemployment
system. Old age pensions are expected to be cut due to demographic  developments
and a higher life expectancy.

   QUESTION:  What about the tax cuts? This seems to be last year's story.  What
is new and how will the economy benefit?

   ANSWER:  The  government  decided to bring forward the third stage of the tax
reform by one year, from 2003 to January 2004. The government estimates that the
additional  relief for  households  would come to about Euro 15 bn, and together
with the second stage of the tax reform would be equal to about Euro 22 bn. This
step is expected to be financed by higher  borrowings,  more radical cuts in tax
subsidies  for  commuters  and  homeowners  as well as  privatization  revenues.
Overall,  this step  would  improve  business  and  consumer  sentiment,  and is
expected to give some additional impulses to growth this and next year. Assuming
that the savings  ratio will rise only  slightly it is expected to add about .3%
to next year's GDP growth.

   QUESTION: Wouldn't this tax cut jeopardize the already high budget deficit in
Germany and with that exceed the 3% Maastricht deficit ceiling?

   ANSWER:  Yes,  it is likely  that  Germany's  2004  deficit  will  exceed the
Maastricht limit for the third time in a row.  However,  this is not necessarily
the governments'  view. So far, if we can believe Finance  Minister  Eichel,  he
seems to be  confident,  that the  Maastricht  deficit will be back below the 3%
ceiling in 2004, provided that the economy grows by 2% next year.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTLOOK FOR THE GERMAN ECONOMY
   Recent news flow  confirms  that the German  economy is at the beginning of a
rebound.  One common  indicator for business  sentiment is the Ifo index,  which
increased  in July  from  88.8 to 89.2 and was  solely  driven  by the  business
expectations component,  which advanced for the third time in a row from 98.6 to
100.2. Another positive signal was received from the German labor market, as the
number of  unemployed  fell by 33,000 in June  after  falling  by 10,000 in May.
These numbers were contrary to market expectations, and were enough to lower the
unemployment  rate for the first  time in two  years  from  10.7% to 10.6%.  Our
assumption is that economic  growth should also receive a boost from the pending
tax reform and the low  interest  rate  environment.  The  outlook on  inflation
remains good with July's inflation number falling to .9% year on year.
   The European  Central Bank  ("ECB") kept  interest  rates on hold in July and
sent a neutral  message to the market with regards to future interest rate cuts.
However, with the refinancing rate at a low 2%, the ECB kept its monetary policy
easy enough to stimulate the Western  European  economies.  Market  participants
still expect another  interest rate cut, which seems rather unlikely in the near
term. Especially, as the ECB is going through its yearly routine of handing over
its presidency and will therefore need the subsequent months to prepare the 2004
budgets.  This could delay a potential  interest  rate cut until  December  4th.
However,  key risks to such an expectation  include a more powerful  recovery of
the European economy and a weaker Euro.
   The Euro  exchange  rate has topped out at around 1.19 against the US$ at the
end of May after  strengthening  more than 29% from a year and a half ago.  This
pause  seems  normal as  Europe's  current  account  surplus  is  narrowing  and
investment  flows into the Euro area are reversing.  Our expectation is that the
Euro will  strengthen  further against the US$, but this  appreciation  could be
delayed if a possible  recovery in the US economy gives rise to renewed  capital
outflows from Euroland.

THE NEW GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The New Germany Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on January
16, 1990 as a non-diversified,  closed-end  management  investment company.  The
Fund commenced investment operations on January 30, 1990.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
The  resultant  gains and losses  arising from exchange  rate  fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable  to  investments  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

During the year ended  December 31, 2002, the Fund  reclassified  permanent book
and tax differences as follows:

                                                  INCREASE
                                                 (DECREASE)
                                                 ---------
Undistributed net investment income ............  $749,608
Undistributed net realized gain on investments
  and foreign currency transactions ............  (749,608)
Paid-in capital ................................         0

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT ANDINVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
The  Fund  has  a  Management   Agreement   with  and  related   undertaking  by
(collectively,  the "Management  Agreement")  Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the
"Manager"),  and an Investment Advisory Agreement with Deutsche Asset Management

Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also

services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders and  selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions  on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
For the six months ended June 30, 2003,  Deutsche  Bank AG, the German parent of
the Manager and  Investment  Adviser,  and its  affiliates  received  $76,863 in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities on behalf of the Fund.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for the six months  ended  June 30,  2003,  were  $63,568,224  and  $62,273,931,
respectively.

The cost of investments at December 31, 2002 was  $147,534,583 for United States
Federal  income  tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2002,  net
unrealized  depreciation  of  investments  aggregated   $28,443,468,   of  which
$6,964,223 and $35,407,691 related to unrealized  appreciation and depreciation,
respectively.

During the period  November  1, 2002 to December  31,  2002,  the Fund  incurred
capital  losses of  $4,748,045.  This loss was deferred  for federal  income tax
purposes to January 1, 2003.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward at December 31, 2002 of  approximately  $199.3 million,  of which $111.0
million and $88.3 million will expire in 2009 and 2010, respectively. No capital
gains distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders until future net gains
have been realized in excess of such carry forward.

NOTE 5. CAPITAL
During the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended  December 31, 2002,
the Fund purchased 274,900 and 870,500 of its shares of common stock on the open

asset value at the time of  purchase  was 20.7% and 17.9%,  respectively.  These
shares are held in treasury.

   ++ Total investment return based on market value is calculated  assuming that
      shares of the Fund's  common stock were  purchased  at the closing  market
      price as of the beginning of the year, dividends,  capital gains and other
      distributions  were  reinvested  as  provided  for in the Fund's  dividend
      reinvestment  plan and then sold at the closing  market price per share on
      the last day of the  year.  The  computation  does not  reflect  any sales
      commission  investors  may incur in  purchasing  or selling  shares of the
      Fund.  The  total  investment  return  based  on the net  asset  value  is
      similarly  computed  except that the Fund's net asset value is substituted
      for the closing market price.
    * The custody  credits are  attributable  to  interest  earned on U.S.  cash
      balances. The ratio of total expenses after custody credits to average net
      assets are 1.55%,  1.47%,  1.25%,  1.08%,  1.07% and .98% for 2003,  2002,
      2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
   ** Annualized.
  *** Not Annualized.
 **** Not Annualized.  The ratio for six months ended June 30, 2003 has not been
      annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate because the
      Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.

The Fund offers  stockholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend

the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:

I, Richard T. Hale, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report, filed on behalf of The New Germany Fund, Inc.,
     on Form N-CSR;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
