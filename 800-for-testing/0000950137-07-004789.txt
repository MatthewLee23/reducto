PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH
MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

                                                                               1

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2007

MARKET CONDITIONS

Solid economic growth, contained inflation, and falling oil and commodity prices
created a favorable environment for senior loans during the six-month reporting
period. Overall trends in the credit markets remained positive as corporations
exhibited strong cash flows and balance sheets, increased productivity, and
improved credit quality while benefiting from a generally lower cost of capital.
In addition, corporate debt default rates remained low.

The Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") finally took a respite from its
two-year long campaign of raising interest rates during the reporting period,
electing to keep its target federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. The
ease in the Fed's monetary policy, however, had been widely anticipated by the
market and interest rates had already declined in response. As a result,
interest rates across the yield curve remained relatively stable throughout the
period. Yields on senior loans, which adjust in tandem to short-term rates, were
generally unchanged as well.

Yield spreads in the senior loan market climbed to late-2005 levels in the third
quarter of 2006, then leveled off until the last month of the period, when they
narrowed slightly. Demand for senior loans remained quite strong as the market
continues to see increasing activity from institutional investors such as hedge
funds and propriety desks, as well as from crossover investments from
traditional high-yield investors. The strong demand for senior loans was met by
robust supply. A significant increase in merger and acquisition activity,
leveraged buyouts, and second lien loans helped fuel record levels of new
issuance. At the same time, senior loan default rates receded throughout the
period, reaching a record low of just 0.78 percent.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. For the six months ended January 31, 2007, the trust returned 10.60
percent on a market price basis and 4.50 percent on an NAV basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information.

We continued to follow our research-intensive investment process focused on
identifying companies with strong management, solid and predictable cash flow,
and sufficient collateral in the event of default. We employ a bottom-up asset
selection process driven by analysis of individual company fundamentals. We also
analyze overall sector and industry trends, which led us to favor loans in
sectors that are typically less cyclical in nature, such as food and drug,
cable, and leisure and entertainment. These sectors continued to be represented
in the trust's top holdings. We also favored less cyclical names in the paper
and packaging sector that have experienced steady demand. Throughout the
reporting period, however, the portfolio was invested in broad range of
industries.

We generally avoid investing in companies that we perceive to be vulnerable to
cyclical economic downturns. As such, we remain cautious regarding the auto and
airline industries due to their susceptibility to high fuel prices.

The trust benefited during the period from our use of leverage. Leverage
involves borrowing at a floating short-term rate and reinvesting the proceeds at
a higher rate. We used this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance
the trust's dividend. Unlike other fixed-income asset classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the trust's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline.) We might reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality
conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the trust's net asset value.

                                                                               3

The trust's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common
shares is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the
market value of the trust's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you
that the Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when
appropriate, purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions at a price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is
lower at the time of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets applicable
    to common shares.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    commitments.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See notes to Financial Statements.

(e) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.2%
    of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

(g) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(h) Payment-in-kind security.

(i) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2007.

(j) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(k) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Trust
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Trust's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and
notes for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the
mean of such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily
available, Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent
market indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board
of Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing
sources approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate, interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit
worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until next
interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loan.
Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have
adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The
fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by the Trust's Valuation
Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Credit default swaps are valued using market quotations from brokers.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by

 40

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

the underlying debt security. The Trust will make payment for such securities
only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of
the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the
underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses. The Trust
may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis,
with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased
is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will segregate
assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount
of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until payment is
made. At January 31, 2007, the Trust had no when-issued or delayed delivery
purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2006, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $218,138,489, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually to common shareholders. Distributions
from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term capital gains,
which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid for the year ended July 31, 2006
were as follows:

    As of July 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were a follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...............................    $6,082,285
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the six months ended January 31, 2007, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $102,800 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Employment
agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides compliance
services to the Trust. The costs of these services are allocated to each trust.
For the six months ended January 31, 2007, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $60,900 representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its
affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the
Trust, as well as, the salary, benefits and related costs of the CCO and related
support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal
Services agreement are reported as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement
of Operations. Services provided pursuant to the CCO Employment agreement are
reported as part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable for a ten-year period
and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust. The maximum
annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

    During the period, the Trust owned shares of the following affiliated
companies. Affiliated companies are defined by the 1940 Act, as amended, as
those companies in which a fund holds 5% or more of the outstanding voting
securities.

</Table>

*   Shares were acquired through the restructuring of Senior Loan interests.

There were no affiliate transactions during the six months ended January 31,
2007.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $1,030,200,089 and $981,414,286,
respectively.

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain Senior Loan agreements, the Trust had unfunded
loan commitments of approximately $98,729,300 as of January 31, 2007. The Trust
intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $1,406,231 as of January 31, 2007 is
reported as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as
to attempt to protect the Trust against possible changes in the market value of
its portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Trust's portfolio
holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with
the change in value reflected in unrealized appreciation/depreciation.

    The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may otherwise invest. A
credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. A buyer of a credit

                                                                              43
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

default swap is said to buy protection by paying periodic fees in return for a
contingent payment from the seller if the issuer has a credit event such as
bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations or deteriorating credit
while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit default swap is said to sell
protection and thus collects the periodic fees and profits if the credit of the
issuer remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding but the seller
in a credit default swap contract would be required to pay an agreed-upon
amount, which approximates the notional amount of the swap as disclosed in the
table following the Portfolio of Investments, to the buyer in the event of an
adverse credit event of the issuer. The Trust accrues for the periodic fees on
swap contracts on a daily basis with the net amount accrued recorded within
unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts. Upon cash settlement of
the periodic fees, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swap
contracts on the Statements of Operations. Net unrealized gains are recorded as
an asset or net unrealized losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value of the swap contracts is reported
as unrealized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations.

    Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if the Trust had
invested in the issuer directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If there is a default by the
counterparty, the Trust will have contractual remedies pursuant to the
agreements related to the transaction.

6. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

    At January 31, 2007, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation
basis.

<Table>

General Electric Capital Corp. .............................   $5,000      $5,017
</Table>

7. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, as amended, a Trust generally may
not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the Trust's total assets or (ii)
issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the Trust's total assets. In using a
combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum
allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more
than 50%) of the Trust's total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or
preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This

 44
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the Trust. For the six
months ended January 31, 2007, the average daily balance of borrowings under the
revolving credit agreement was $555,483,696 with a weighted average interest
rate of 5.20%.

8. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

The Trust has outstanding 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series W,
Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares (APS), $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $700 million. Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven days through
an auction process. The average rate in effect on January 31, 2007 was 5.040%.
During the six months ended January 31, 2007, the rates ranged from 4.900% to
5.350%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

9. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

10. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation
of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before
being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax
years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance allows implementing FIN 48
in the trust NAV calculations as late as the trust's last NAV calculation in the
first required financial statement period. As a result, the Trust will
incorporate FIN 48 in its semi annual report on January 31, 2008. The impact to
the Trust's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

                                                                              45
