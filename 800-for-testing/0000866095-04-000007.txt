DEAR SHAREHOLDERS:

     It is our pleasure on behalf of the Board of Directors
to present the
Semi-Annual Report for The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") for the six
months ended April 30, 2004.

PERFORMANCE AND REVIEW OF THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET

     - During the period November 2003 through April 2004,
the Fund's portfolio
       increased by 12.33%. Over the same period, the TOPIX
advanced by 12.10%
       in U.S. dollar ("USD") terms.

     - On the other hand, in Japanese Yen ("JPY") terms, the
performance of the
       Fund, excluding expenses and the cash position effect,
represented
       16.27%, whereas the TOPIX was up 13.70%.

     - Relative to the TOPIX, stock selection contributed
substantially to the
       relative performance while sector selection within
sectors was slightly
       negative (see Table 3).

     - As shown below on Table 4, stock selection was
primarily strong in
       Wholesale Trade and Transport Equipment. On the other
hand, stock
       holdings in Other Financing Business hurt the results.

     - Out performance in the Retail Trade sector in which we
were overweight
       provided positive relative performance, while the
underweight stance in
       Banks detracted from the relative result.

MARKET REVIEW (NOVEMBER 2003 - APRIL 2004)

     During the six month period, the Japanese stock market
showed solid
movement with the TOPIX advancing by 13.70% on a JPY basis.
To review the
Japanese equity market for the period:

     - November 03: From the outset of November, the market
was upbeat mirroring
       the surge in U.S. stocks and the Yen's depreciation.
However, on November
       17th, the Nikkei 225 Index ("Nikkei 225") fell below
the psychologically
       important 10,000-mark as investor sentiment cooled
ahead of the House of
       Representatives elections and in response to the
decline in U.S. stocks
       and the U.S. dollar and the recent terrorist attacks.
During this period,
       liquidation of margin positions by individual
investors was also
       apparent. As the U.S. market began to pick up, the
Nikkei 225 recovered
       to move above 10,000 on November 26th. Even so, the
TOPIX closed below
       1,000 points at month-end following a Nikkei Shinbun
report on November
       28th indicating that Ashikaga Financial Group was to
receive an injection
       of public funds. During November, the average daily
trading volume on the
       Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") First Section was 1.06
billion shares, with
       an average traded value of JPY1.09 trillion, both
being below October's
       levels.

     - December 03: The stock market rose sharply at the
beginning of December
       upon positive expectations for the U.S. Christmas
sales season, but with
       the Yen continuing to appreciate and U.S. stocks
declining, the Nikkei
       225 slid below 10,000 points on December 10th. After
that, the Nikkei 225
       was heavily moved by expectations following the
disappointment
       surrounding U.S. stocks after the capture of former
Iraqi President
       Saddam Hussein. Even so, momentum gradually declined
in the run-up to the
       holiday season for non-Japanese investors.
Nevertheless, toward the end
       of the month (and the year), the United States and
other leading overseas
       markets strengthened and the Nikkei 225 ended the
month with a three-day
       rally, despite relatively thin trading, on both a
sense of lagging behind
       overseas markets and expectations for the overall
market in the new year.
       With this, 2003 was the first year since 1999 that the
market closed the
       year higher.

                                        2
<Page>

     - January 04: In January, Japanese stocks made a strong
start at the
       opening session of the year, reflecting the global
rise in stock markets
       at year-end and through the New Year's holiday.
Nevertheless, the TOPIX
       recorded five consecutive days of decline for the
first time since April
       2003 at January-end, slowing its monthly growth rate
to 0.4%. Individual
       investors remained active players from start to
finish, and the Nikkei
       JASDAQ Stock Average rose for 21 days in a row during
the course of the
       month, indicating the good performance of small-caps.
Aggressive buying
       by non-Japanese investors of Japanese equities was
seen as the Japanese
       market was deemed to be lagging overseas stocks.
However, domestic
       investors began to take profits ahead of the end of
the fiscal year in
       recognition of the strength of the Yen and the
unwinding of cross
       shareholdings. As a result, rising prices were quickly
capped as the
       market approached its 2003 high. From mid-month
onwards, investors began
       to expect an expansion in high tech firm's earnings
ahead of third
       quarter results announcements, with leading electrical
machinery stocks
       recording highs. In spite of this, adjustments by
major banks, the
       slowdown in non-Japanese investors' activity ahead of
the month-end and
       the plunge in U.S. stocks after the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC)
       meeting led to a cooling in investor sentiment,
bringing the market to a
       close on a weak note at the end of the month.

     - February 04: The Tokyo stock market in February was
characterized by a
       stronger rising trend from the middle to the end of
the month. Continuing
       from the end of the previous month, attention in early
February remained
       focused on major high tech companies' earnings
announcements. While the
       results themselves were not bad, they did not surpass
expectations and
       failed to fuel a rise in the overall market.
Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225
       temporarily endured a stronger declining trend as
overseas investors
       withdrew from buying amid a market that was
susceptible to a wait-and-see
       mood. This attitude was attributed to the upcoming
special inspections at
       major banks and the G7 meeting.

       Following these intial trends, both U.S. and Japanese
stocks turned
       around and entered a rising trend, encouraged by U.S.
Federal Reserve
       Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony. Although
there were concerns
       about supply/demand deterioration factors in light of
an offering of JR
       West shares and the unwinding of cross-shareholdings
before the end of
       the fiscal year, stocks remained in a rising trend
throughout the month.
       This was due to increased expectations that the
domestic economy would
       continue to recover on the back of the U.S. dollar
recovering to Y109/$,
       high October-December Gross Domestic Product ("GDP")
growth and improved
       industrial production in January. During this period,
investors sought a
       wide range of stocks, covering everything from export-
related to domestic
       demand issues. The Nikkei 225 recovered above 11,000
points.

     - March 04: In March, the stock market generally
remained on a rising
       trend, with the TOPIX closing the month at its highest
level since the
       beginning of 2003. It rose by 49.6% in fiscal year
2003, the first rise
       since fiscal year 1999 and the biggest gain since
fiscal year 1986
       (47.8%). Throughout the month, non-Japanese investors
continued to be
       aggressive buyers of Japanese stocks on the back of
expectations that the
       recovery in the domestic economy would spread. There
were a number of
       negative incentives, such as concerns over a rise in
the unwinding of
       cross shareholdings ahead of the end of the fiscal
year, the terrorist
       attacks against trains in Spain, the assassination of
the founder of the
       Hamas movement by Israeli forces, a temporary
adjustment in U.S. stock
       prices and a return of JPY appreciation. However,
these were counteracted
       by prospects of further rises in stock prices over the
medium term, as
       indicators such as corporate statistics and land
prices boosted
       confidence even further. With expectations of
increased consumer
       spending, an end to deflation and the bottoming out of
land prices, stock
       selection focused on domestic demand issues, with
materials issues also
       sought after toward the end of the month.

                                        3
<Page>

     - April 04: In April, although the stock market was
mostly unchanged over
       the month, it was firm overall on the back of an
improvement in the
       Japanese economy and expectations of growth in
corporate earnings. The
       TOPIX was above the 1,200-point level for most of the
month. Even when
       the market was sent down by negative incentives, such
as reports that UFJ
       Holdings had more bad loans than it had admitted, the
adjustment of U.S.
       stocks and news that three Japanese nationals had been
taken hostage in
       Iraq, buying on decline promptly kicked in. As a
result, trading volume
       maintained a high level, but the upside appeared to be
capped at the end
       of the month. On April 30, the last trading day of the
month, the TOPIX
       closed below the 1,200-point level on adjustments of
cash positions, due
       to incentives running dry, with the end of earnings
announcements at
       leading companies and uncertainty in overseas markets
as a result of
       fears of an economic slowdown stemming from monetary
tightening in the
       United States and China. Total trading volume in April
exceeded the total
       trading volume in March to hit a record high.

OUTLOOK

     Concerns about higher interest rates, contraction of
excess liquidity and a
slowdown in China have resurfaced as new realities. After an
over 50% rebound in
the last twelve months, a consolidation or correction in the
Tokyo market seems
natural at this stage, as is the case with other equity
markets around the
world.

     The market has reacted to the wave of positive earnings
news from
technology firms. We expect companies, particularly
manufacturers, to present
conservative outlooks for fiscal year 2004 (vs. market
expectations). We think
the TOPIX will settle down into a box range of 1000 to 1200
due to a lack of
news once non-manufacturer result announcements run their
course in May.

     We believe medium and long-term investors should take a
buy-on-dips
strategy in the mean time. After bottoming out in January
2001, the Japanese
economy has been in a recovery phase that could be a
historically durable one.
While cyclical factors may cause a slow-down in corporate
earnings in the second
half of this year, valuations in the Japanese stock market
remain near the
bottom of their trading ranges. One-year forward earnings-
per-share, at 19 times
earnings, is based on the assumption of a 30% increase in
bottom-line profit in
fiscal 2004.

     The initial stages of the recovery favored cyclicals,
lower-quality
equities, and smaller capitalization companies. However, we
would expect
higher-quality companies with sustainable growth
characteristics to lead the way
as global growth momentum stabilizes.

     Major factors to be scrutinized in the meantime will
continue to be the
U.S. and Chinese economies, and the Japanese economy's
relative sensitivity to
them.

     (1)  Recent U.S. economic statistics, including job
reports and factory
          orders, indicate the necessity of interest rate
hikes this summer,
          aside from U.S. political considerations. A key
question is whether
          capital expenditure will recover sufficiently to
cover a possible
          slowdown in housing and consumption, which are more
sensitive to
          short-term interest rate movements. It is
reasonable to expect a
          slowdown of economic growth in the second half of
2004 and in 2005.

     (2)  The Chinese government is serious about combating
excess investment in
          basic industries, including steel, cement, aluminum
and automobiles.
          Monetary tightening, including higher reserve
requirements and direct
          control of bank lending, has already hit the world
commodities
          markets. This, in combination with probable U.S.
interest rate hikes
          and a stronger U.S. dollar, has been forcing
speculators to leave the
          commodities markets. The correction of the
commodities markets itself
          is not a negative factor, as it will relieve raw
material cost
          pressures on manufacturing industries. We believe
the Chinese

                                        4
<Page>

          economy will be able to achieve a soft-landing this
time unlike
          1993-94, as money supply growth and inflation are
much lower than the
          previous cycle and excesses are limited to several
sectors as
          mentioned above. Economic policy performance over
the next three to
          six months should be watched, as China has become a
big theme in
          financial and commodities markets.

     (3)  The Japanese economic recovery, triggered initially
by exports, has
          permeated through capital expenditures and personal
consumption.
          However, the momentum of Japanese economic recovery
seemed to be
          slowing down sequentially in the quarter ended
March 31, 2004 given
          the erratic movements in industrial production and
machinery orders.
          On the other hand, business sentiment remained
quite high and there
          were improvements in lagging sectors such as
services and small
          enterprises. Whether Japan will be able to sustain
its economic
          recovery based on consumption and capital
expenditure will be tested
          by the less friendly external economic
circumstances outlined above,
          particularly any slowdown in China, in late 2004
and in 2005.

     As of April 30, 2004, the Fund's net assets were
approximately $95.3
million, which represents a net asset value of $6.61 per
share. The change in
net asset value in USD depends on several factors such as:
(1) the percentage
change in the benchmark during the period; (2) the over-or
under-performance of
the Fund's portfolio, after expenses, relative to the
benchmark; and (3) the
change in the JPY/USD exchange rate.

     Our investment strategy is to invest in undervalued
securities based on
intensive bottom-up analysis supported by quantitative
screening. In our
research efforts, we place a priority on evaluation of the
top management, and
its commitment to enhance shareholder value through clear-cut
strategies,
including restructuring, that will be eventually reflected in
share prices. We
add value primarily through a bottom-up stock selection
approach for the
fundamental Japan equity product.

     It is important to emphasize again that it has not been
an objective of the
Fund to predict changes in its benchmark. Rather, its goal is
to outperform the
benchmark, while staying fairly fully invested. Specifically,
the goal is to
hold no more than 5% in cash. On April 30, 2004, the
proportion of the Fund's
net assets invested in Japanese equities listed on the First
Section of the TSE
was 97.65%, while short-term investments and other net assets
represented 2.35%.

     The invested position of the Fund's assets consisted of
common stocks of
Japanese companies operating in 27 different industries. The
Fund had relatively
large weightings in Electric Appliances (16.68% of net
assets), Transportation
Equipment (9.98%), Communication (9.13%) and Banks (8.44%).

     During the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Fund's
market price on the
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") ranged from a low of $6.15
per share on
December 18, 2003 to a high of $7.75 on April 12, 2004. The
Fund's NYSE market
price closed at $6.79 per share on April 30, 2004.

     The NYSE trading price in relation to the Fund's net
asset value per share,
as measured by the weekly closing prices during the six
months ended April 30,
2004, ranged from a low premium of 1.80% on January 29, 2004
to a high premium
of 22.90% on November 6, 2003, and ended the period at a
premium of 2.72%.

     On December 23, 2003, the Fund successfully completed a
rights offering
resulting in the issuance of 3,605,229 new shares,
representing proceeds to the
Fund of approximately $19.4 million, after deducting for all
expenses.

     The Fund has not invested in derivative securities.
Although foreign
currency hedging is permitted by the Fund's prospectus, the
Fund has not engaged
in any foreign currency hedging.

THE JAPAN EQUITY FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was
incorporated in Maryland on
July 12, 1990 under its former name "The Japan Emerging
Equity Fund, Inc." and
commenced operations on July 24, 1992. It is registered with
the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a closed-end, diversified management
investment company.

     The following significant accounting policies are in
conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America for
investment companies. Such policies are consistently followed
by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of
financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual
reporting results
could differ from those estimates.

     VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--Securities which are listed on
the Tokyo Stock
Exchange or listed on the over-the-counter market in Japan or
listed on other
exchanges in Japan and for which market quotations are
readily available are
valued at the last reported sales price available to the Fund
at the close of
business on the day the securities are being valued or,
lacking any such sales,
at the last available bid price. In instances where
quotations are not readily
available or where the price as determined by the above
procedures is deemed not
to represent fair market value, fair value will be determined
in such manner as
the Board of Directors (the "Board") may prescribe. Short-
term investments
having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost, except where
the Board determines that such valuation does not represent
the fair value of
the investment. All other securities and assets are valued at
fair value as
determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the
Board.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION--The books and records of
the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the foreign
currency market value of
investment securities and other assets and liabilities stated
in Japanese yen
are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of
the period; and
(2) purchases, sales, income and expenses are translated at
the rate of exchange
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. The
resulting exchange
gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations.
The Fund does not
isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
from the effect of
fluctuations in the market price of securities.

     TAX STATUS--The Fund intends to continue to distribute
substantially all of
its taxable income and to comply with the minimum
distribution and other
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
regulated investment
companies. Accordingly, no provision for federal income or
excise taxes is
required.

     The Fund is not subject to any Japanese income, capital
gains or other
taxes except for withholding taxes on certain income,
generally imposed at rates
of 10% on interest and dividends, paid to the Fund by
Japanese corporations.

     INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--
Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date (the date upon which the order to
buy or sell is
executed). Realized and unrealized gains and losses from
security and foreign
currency transactions are calculated on the identified cost
basis. Dividend
income and corporate actions are recorded generally on the
ex-date, except for
certain dividends and corporate actions from Japanese
securities which may be
recorded after the ex-date, as soon as the Fund acquires
information regarding
such dividends or corporate actions. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual
basis.

                                       16
<Page>

     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS--The Fund
records dividends and
distributions payable to its shareholders on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of
dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These book basis/tax
basis differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the
extent these differences are permanent in nature, such
amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis
treatment;
temporary differences do not require reclassifications.
Dividends and
distributions which exceed net investment income and net
realized capital gains
for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in-
capital.

INVESTMENT MANAGER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER

     The Fund has entered into an Investment Management
Agreement with Daiwa SB
Investments (U.S.A.) Ltd. (the "Manager"). Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. ("DSBI" or
the "Adviser"), an affiliate of the Manager, acts as the
Fund's investment
adviser pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement between
the Manager and
DSBI. For such investment services, the Fund is obligated to
pay the Manager a
monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.60% of the first $20
million, 0.40% of the
next $30 million and 0.20% of the excess over $50 million of
the Fund's average
weekly net assets, of which fee 60% is paid by the Manager to
DSBI. In addition,
the Fund has agreed to reimburse the Manager and the Adviser
for all
out-of-pocket expenses related to the Fund. For the six
months ended April 30,
2004, there were no out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Manager or the
Adviser.

     At April 30, 2004, the Fund owed $27,659 to the Manager
and the Manager
informed the Fund that it owed the Adviser $16,595.

     Brokerage commissions of $26,364 were paid by the Fund
to Daiwa Securities
America, Inc., an affiliate of both the Manager and DSBI, in
connection with
portfolio transactions during the six months ended April 30,
2004.

ADMINISTRATOR AND CUSTODIAN AND OTHER RELATED PARTIES

     Daiwa Securities Trust Company ("DSTC"), an affiliate of
the Adviser,
provides certain administrative services to the Fund, for
which the Fund pays to
DSTC a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.20% of the first
$60 million of the
Fund's average weekly net assets, 0.15% of the next $40
million and 0.10% of the
excess over $100 million, with a minimum annual fee of
$120,000. In addition, as
permitted by the Administration Agreement, the Fund
reimburses the Administrator
for its out-of-pocket expenses related to the Fund. For the
six months ended
April 30, 2004, expenses of $4,350 were paid to the
Administrator, representing
reimbursement to the Administrator of costs relating to the
attendance by its
employees at meetings of the Fund's Board.

     DSTC also acts as custodian for the Fund's assets and
has appointed
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the "Sub-Custodian"), an
affiliate of the
Manager, to act as the sub-custodian for all of the cash and
securities of the
Fund held in Japan. As compensation for its services as
custodian, DSTC receives
a monthly fee and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.
Such expenses include
fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Sub-Custodian. During
the six months
ended April 30, 2004, DSTC and the Sub-Custodian earned
$22,810 and $44,862,
respectively, as compensation for custodial service to the
Fund.

                                       17
<Page>

     At April 30, 2004, the Fund owed $14,596 and $4,303 to
DSTC for
administration and custodian fees, respectively, excluding
fees and expenses of
$5,995 payable to the Sub-Custodian.

     During the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Fund
paid or accrued
$37,295 for legal services in connection with the Fund's on-
going operations to
a law firm of which the Fund's Assistant Secretary is a
partner.

owned at April 30,
2004 was $81,543,867. At April 30, 2004, the net unrealized

of par value upon completion of the offering. Dealer manager
and soliciting fees
