EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of April 30, 2004

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS E. FAUST JR.]
Thomas E. Faust Jr.
President

We are pleased to welcome shareholders of Eaton Vance Limited Duration Income
Fund with this initial annual shareholder report. Based on share price (traded
on the American Stock Exchange), the Fund had a total return of 0.13% for the
period from inception on May 30, 2003 through April 30, 2004. That return was
the result of a decrease in share price to $17.81 on April 30, 2004 from $19.10
on May 30, 2003, and the reinvestment of $1.345 in regular monthly
dividends.(1)

Based on net asset value, the Fund had a total return of 7.22% for the same
period. That return was the result of a decrease in net asset value per share to
$19.07 on April 30, 2004 from $19.10 on May 30, 2003, and the reinvestment of
all distributions.(1)

Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $17.81, the Fund had a
market yield of 9.06% at April 30, 2004.(2) On April 30, 2004, the Fund's share
price on the American Stock Exchange traded at a 6.6% discount to its underlying
net asset value.

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS RESPONDED TO SIGNS OF AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY...

The Fund made its debut during a year that provided investors with a host of
challenges and opportunities, as the financial markets responded to growing
economic momentum, rising inflation and ongoing geo-political concerns. The
Fund's primary goal is to provide a high level of current income. The Fund
typically expects to maintain a duration of between two and four years and
invests primarily in three market segments: mortgage-backed securities, senior
floating-rate loans, and non-investment-grade corporate bonds. At April 30,
2004, the Fund's investments (as a percentage of net assets) - including the
effect of leverage were invested 50.6% in mortgage-backed securities (MBS),
48.8% in non-investment grade corporate bonds and 46.8% in senior floating-rate
loans.(3)

The Fund's investment areas each made steps toward recovery during the period.
The loan market recovered from its previous sharp declines. The MBS market
stabilized following the dramatically lower interest rates and unusually high
prepayment rates of 2003. And the non-investment grade bond market - so closely
tied to economic activity - turned in a very strong performance.

THE FUND OFFERS A VERSATILE APPROACH...

A stronger economy can be a mixed blessing for fixed-income investors, as the
potential for inflation and higher interest rates can pose a major threat. With
its blend of asset classes - MBS, floating-rate loans and non-investment grade
bonds - we believe that the Fund offers a versatile fixed-income approach in a
period of economic growth. In the following pages, Scott Page, Payson Swaffield,
Susan Schiff and Michael Weilheimer review the Fund's activities in its first
year of operation.

                                                    Sincerely,

                                                    /s/ Thomas E. Faust Jr.
                                                    Thomas E. Faust Jr.
                                                    President

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of April 30, 2004
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

AN INTERVIEW WITH SCOTT H. PAGE, PAYSON F. SWAFFIELD, SUSAN SCHIFF AND MICHAEL
W. WEILHEIMER, VICE PRESIDENTS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF EATON VANCE LIMITED
DURATION INCOME FUND.

[PHOTO OF SCOTT H. PAGE]

Scott H. Page

Q:   SCOTT, HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE LOAN MARKET IN THE PERIOD SINCE THE
     FUND'S INCEPTION?

A:   MR. PAGE: The loan market has responded well to signs of a stronger
     economy. That has been especially true of economically sensitive industrial
     and technology companies, which have seen a recovery in orders in response
     to increased capital spending. In addition, many companies are now reaping
     the benefits of having cut costs and restructured operations during the
     economic downturn, moves that left them with leaner operations, stronger
     finances and globally more competitive. Moreover, the overall credit
     environment has improved in the course of the past year.

     Meanwhile, there have been signs that inflation is increasing with the the
     stronger economy. Short-term interest rates, which have been near 45-year
     lows, have begun to move higher in recent months. The Federal Reserve,
     which has maintained a stable monetary policy in recent months, has
     recently suggested that it may raise rates if it detects a growing threat
     from inflation. An increase in rates should result in higher income returns
     for the loan market.

Payson F. Swaffield

Q:   PAYSON, HOW HAS INVESTOR SENTIMENT CHANGED WITHIN THE LOAN MARKET IN THE
     PAST YEAR?

A:   MR. SWAFFIELD: One major change has been that, as the credit climate has
     improved, investor demand has exceeded supply. Investors have been
     attracted by loans' short re-set provisions, which provide higher interest
     income as short-term interest rates rise. As a result of stronger demand,
     credit spreads - the difference between loan interest rates and the
     London-Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) - have narrowed slightly.

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND ARE
CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE COVER.
THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR OTHER
CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH VIEWS.
THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE INVESTMENT
DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED
ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY EATON VANCE FUND.

     and are subject to change.

     Another change in the loan market in 2004 is that performance has been less
     influenced by price movement and more so by interest payments. Following
     the recovery from its previous sharp declines, the loan market has
     generally improved, and many credits previously priced below par have
     returned to or near par. That has kept investors focused on the income
     potential of the loan market.

Q:   HOW HAVE YOU POSITIONED THE FUND'S LOAN INVESTMENTS?

A:   MR. PAGE: We've created a diversified portfolio of loan investments,
     including economically sensitive industrial sectors. These companies have
     fared very well in the economic recovery. However, we are not market or
     credit cycle timers. Therefore, our investments also included defensive
     sectors, such as beverages, foods and healthcare. Broadly diversifying on a
     sector basis helped to mitigate overall risk.

     Our conservative credit approach led us to underweight the telecom sector,
     in general, even though this area was among the market's stronger
     performers during the past year. While the short-term performance of the
     group was impressive, we maintained very strict credit criteria and,
     therefore, continue to be very selective within the telecom sector.

Susan Schiff

Q:   SUSAN, HOW HAVE INTEREST RATES IMPACTED THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
     MARKET IN THE PAST YEAR?

A:   MS. SCHIFF: The MBS market has fluctuated widely over the past year. 2003
     was one of the worst-performing years on record for the market, due to the
     record number of re-financings on the part of homeowners. As homeowners
     refinanced to lock in low interest rates, prepayment rates for mortgages
     rose to record levels. Soaring prepayment rates caused larger-than-expected
     principal losses.

     In 2004, the MBS market has stabilized somewhat. With a stronger economy,
     interest rates have been rising for the last few months and may quite
     possibly head higher in coming months. With a changed interest rate
     environment, the wave of refinancings has slowed, resulting in lower
     prepayment rates. MBS spreads over Treasury bonds have narrowed in recent
     months, a sign of a healthier market. Thus, while the market has seen some
     volatility, the trend has improved in 2004.

Q:   WHERE IN THE MBS MARKET HAVE YOU FOCUSED THE FUND'S INVESTMENTS?

A:   MS. SCHIFF: We have focused the Fund's MBS investments on the seasoned
     segment of the market. Last year's spike notwithstanding, seasoned MBS have
     had more stable historical prepayment rates, which have contributed to more
     attractive performance characteristics. In addition, seasoned MBS have
     continued to maintain an attractive yield advantage over Treasury bonds.

Q:   WAS LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE BY SEASONED MBS A DEPARTURE FROM HISTORICAL
     NORMS?

A:   MS. SCHIFF: Yes, especially for seasoned MBS. As a result of the sharp rise
     in prepayment rates, seasoned MBS ended the year valued at very cheap
     levels relative to Treasuries. That was out of line with historical
     patterns. So much so that, in my view, seasoned MBS still represent good
     value, as spreads remain attractive. While there is no guarantee that past
     trends will repeat, we believe it's probable that spreads for seasoned MBS
     will revert to their historical patterns and continue to narrow further, as
     they have in the first months of 2004. At a minimum, lower prepayment rates
     should help the seasoned portion of the market.

Michael W. Weilheimer

Q:   MIKE, HOW HAS THE NON-INVESTMENT GRADE BOND MARKET RESPONDED TO THE
     IMPROVED ECONOMY?

A:   MR. WEILHEIMER: The non-investment grade bond market saw significant gains
     in 2003. That momentum carried through February 2004 before giving up some
     ground. Corporate earnings have improved with the economic recovery. With
     stronger cash flow, companies have been able to reduce their debt burden
     and significantly improve their balance sheets. This trend has created a
     much healthier credit environment, as evidenced by the decline in default
     rates. Investors have demonstrated greater tolerance for risk and
     increasing confidence in the non-investment grade market. Record new issue
     volume has met strong demand from investors. In that climate, the
     high-yield market has posted impressive gains.

Q:   WHERE HAVE YOU FOCUSED THE FUND'S NON-INVESTMENT GRADE INVESTMENTS?

A:   MR. WEILHEIMER: We have focused on the B-rated portion of the market, which
     is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the economy. Many of these companies
     in the industrial and technology-related sectors have enjoyed stronger
     sales momentum. Earnings have been further helped by the cost cuts
     instituted by many companies in recent years. Not surprisingly, as economic
     activity has picked up, these lower-rated bonds have significantly
     outperformed their high-rated counterparts. The Fund's largest high-yield
     sector weight-ings were broadcasting and entertainment; telecommunications;
     hotels, motels, inns and gaming; healthcare, education and childcare; and
     utilities.

Q:   WHAT HAS BEEN NOTABLE AMONG THE FUND'S NON-INVESTMENT GRADE BOND
     INVESTMENTS?

A:   MR. WEILHEIMER: The Fund's utility bonds have been especially strong
     performers. As recently as 2002, the industry was faced with financial
     pressures and bankruptcies. Many companies have since taken steps to
     improve their financial footing. The Fund's utility investments included a
     mix of power generating companies and pipeline companies that have pared or
     restructured debt, issued equity and bought back their own bonds at a
     discount in the market. That has greatly improved the companies' balance
     sheets.

     Increased merger and acquisition activity benefited some of the Fund's
     investments in the chemical, consumer product and retailing areas. These
     mergers included tenders for outstanding bonds by acquiring companies,
     resulting in significant gains for some bonds.

     Defensive areas, such as beverages and food, were less robust performers.
     These companies' revenues are less tied to overall economic activity and,
     therefore, were less influenced by the economic recovery.

(1)    Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
       flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to
       which borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
       election, cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual
       remaining maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities
       shown. However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests
       will have an expected average life of approximately two to four years.

(2)    A portion of this security is on loan at April 30, 2004.

(3)    Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
       of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
       registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

Note:  At April 30, 2004, the Fund had unfunded commitments amounting to
       $11,499,612 under various credit agreements.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of April 30, 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    Eaton Vance Limited Duration Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified closed-end
    management investment company. The Fund, which was organized as a
    Massachusetts business trust on March 12, 2003, seeks to provide a high
    level of current income. The Fund may, as a secondary objective, also seek
    capital appreciation to the extent consistent with its primary goal of high
    current income. The Fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in,
    mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued, backed or otherwise guaranteed by
    the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; senior, secured
    floating rate loans made to corporate and other business entities (Senior
    Loans); and corporate bonds of below investment grade quality
    (Non-Investment Grade Bonds). The following is a summary of significant
    accounting policies of the Fund. The policies are in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

    A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Mortgage backed, pass-through securities are
    valued using an independent matrix pricing system applied by the adviser
    which takes into account closing bond valuations, yield differentials,
    anticipated prepayments and interest rates provided by dealers. Debt
    securities (other than seasoned mortgage backed, pass-through securities)
    are normally valued on the basis of valuations furnished by dealers or a
    pricing service. Certain senior loans are deemed to be liquid because
    reliable market quotations are readily available for them. Liquid senior
    loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service.
    Other senior loans are valued at fair value by the Fund's investment
    adviser, Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures established by the
    Trustees as permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of
    1940. Such procedures include the consideration of relevant factors, data
    and information relating to fair value, including (i) the characteristics of
    and fundamental analytical data relating to the Senior Loan, including the
    cost, size, current interest rate, period until next interest rate reset,
    maturity and base lending rate of the Senior Loan, the terms and conditions
    of the Senior Loan and any related agreements, and the position of the
    Senior Loan in the Borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and
    value of the collateral, including the Fund's rights, remedies and interests
    with respect to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of the Borrower,
    based on an evaluation of its financial condition, financial statements and
    information about the Borrower's business, cash flows, capital structure and
    future prospects; (iv) information relating to the market for the Senior
    Loan including price quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan, and
    interests in similar Senior Loans and the market environment and investor
    attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior Loans; (v)
    the experience, the reputation, stability and financial condition of the
    agent and any intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general
    economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan.
    Other portfolio's securities (other than short-term obligations, but
    including listed issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by
    one or more pricing services which determine prices for normal,
    institutional-size trading units of such securities which may use market
    information, transactions for comparable securities and various
    relationships between securities which are generally recognized by
    institutional traders. In certain circumstances, portfolio securities will
    be valued at the last sales price on the exchange that is the primary market
    for such securities, or the last quoted bid price for those securities for
    which the over-the-counter market is the primary market or for listed
    securities in which there were no sales during the day. The value of
    interest rate swaps will be based on dealer quotations. Short-term
    obligations which mature in 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
    if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Fund was 60 days or
    less or are valued at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior
    to maturity, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Fund
    was more than 60 days, unless in each case this is determined not to
    represent fair value. OTC options are valued at the mean between the bid and
    asked price provided by dealers. Financial futures contracts listed on
    commodity exchanges and exchange traded options are valued at closing
    settlement prices. Securities for which there is no such quotation or
    valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by
    or at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements are valued at
    cost plus accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for which there are
    no quotations or valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good
    faith by or on behalf of the Trustees.

    B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
    basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
    determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
    premium or accretion of discount. Dividend income is recorded on the
    ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

    C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
    distribute to

                                       27
<Page>

    shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any net realized
    gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise
    tax is necessary. At April 30, 2004, the Fund, for federal income tax
    purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $26,481,368 which will reduce the
    Fund's taxable income arising from future net realized gains on investments,
    if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, and thus will
    reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders which would otherwise
    be necessary to relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income or
    excise tax. Such capital loss carryover will expire on April 30, 2012.

    At April 30, 2004, net capital losses of $17,668,020 attributable to
    security transactions incurred after October 31, 2003, are treated as
    arising on the first day of the Fund's taxable year ending April 30, 2005.
    At April 30, 2004 the undistributed ordinary income on a tax basis was
    $10,821,853 and differed from accumulated net investment loss due to the
    different treatment for paydown gains/losses on mortgage-backed securities
    and premium amortization. All distributions in the year ended April 30, 2004
    were from ordinary income for tax purposes.

    D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
    date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
    using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
    when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
    the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
    fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
    delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
    segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
    to the amount of its purchase commitments.

    E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with the
    offering of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
    reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

    F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
    custodian of the Fund. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
    fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
    balances the Fund maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used
    to reduce the Fund's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses
    on the Statement of Operations

    G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount
    equal to the premium received by the Fund is included in the Statement of
    Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is
    subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
    written in accordance with the Fund's policies on investment valuations
    discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
    treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are
    exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or
    amount paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a
    put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the
    securities purchased by the Fund. The Fund, as writer of an option, may have
    no control over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or
    purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable
    change in the price of the securities underlying the written option.

    H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the
    premium paid by the Fund is included in the Statement of Assets and
    Liabilities as an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently
    marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
    purchased, in accordance with the Fund's policies on investment valuations
    discussed above. If an option which the Fund has purchased expires on the
    stipulated expiration date, the Fund will realize a loss in the amount of
    the cost of the option. If the Fund enters into a closing sale transaction,
    the Fund will realize a gain or loss, depending on whether the sales
    proceeds from the closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost
    of the option. If a Fund exercises a put option, it will realize a gain or
    loss from the sale of the underlying security, and the proceeds from such
    sale will be decreased by the premium originally paid. If the Fund exercises
    a call option, the cost of the security which the Fund purchases upon
    exercise will be increased by the premium originally paid.

    I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
    contract, the Fund is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either
    in cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
    indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
    received by the Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
    fluctuations in the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for
    book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Fund.

    If the Fund enters into a closing transaction, the Fund will realize, for
    book purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
    the financial futures

                                       28
<Page>

    contract to sell and the financial futures contract to buy. The Fund's
    investment in financial futures contracts is designed only to hedge against
    anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should interest rates move
    unexpectedly, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
    financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

    J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Fund may enter into reverse
    repurchase agreements. Under such an agreement, the Fund temporarily
    transfers possession, but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in
    return for cash. At the same time, the Fund agrees to repurchase the
    security at an agreed-upon price and time in the future. The Fund may enter
    into reverse repurchase agreements for temporary purposes, such as to fund
    withdrawals, or for use as hedging instruments where the underlying security
    is denominated in a foreign currency. As a form of leverage, reverse
    repurchase agreements may increase the risk of fluctuation in the market
    value of the Fund's assets or in its yield. Liabilities to counterparties
    under reverse repurchase agreements are recognized in the Statement of
    Assets and Liabilities at the same time at which cash is received by the
    Fund. The securities underlying such agreements continue to be treated as
    owned by the Fund and remain in the Portfolio of Investments. Interest
    charged on amounts borrowed by the Fund under reverse repurchase agreements
    is accrued daily.

    K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements to enhance
    return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities prices or interest rates
    or as substitution for the purchase or sale of securities. Pursuant to these
    agreements, the Fund makes monthly payments at a rate equal to a
    predetermined spread to the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Fund receives
    payments based on the rate of return of a benchmark industry index. During
    the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value
    of the swap are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received
    or made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as realized gains
    and losses. The value of the swap is determined by changes in the
    relationship between the rate of interest and the benchmark industry index.
    The Fund is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the
    swap counterparty. However, the Fund does not anticipate non-performance by
    the counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in
    value of interest rates or the index.

    L OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
    securities are purchased or sold. Realized gains and losses are computed
    based on the specific identification of securities sold.

    M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during
    the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    N INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Fund's organizational documents, its
    officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
    expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund, and
    shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of
    the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters
    into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification
    clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
    this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have
    not yet occurred.

2   AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)
    The Fund issued 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A, 7,600
    shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B, 7,600 shares of Auction
    Preferred Shares Series C, 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series
    D, and 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series E on July 25, 2003 in
    a public offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were
    recorded as a reduction of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on
    the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
    at the offering of the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an
    auction. Dividend rates ranged from 1.02% to 1.59% for Series A Shares, from
    1.02% to 1.59% for Series B Shares, from 1.03% to 1.59% for Series C Shares,
    from 1.03% to 1.59% for Series D Shares and from 1.02% to 1.59% for Series E
    Shares, during the period from the commencement of the offering, July 25,
    2003, to April 30, 2004.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price
    equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
    dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
    redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
    dividends, if the Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset
    maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the
    APS shall remain unpaid in an amount

                                       29
<Page>

    equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class have
    the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the
    holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting rights of one
    vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a separate class,
    have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of Trustees. The
    APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and
    unpaid dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage
    with respect to the APS as defined in the Fund's By-Laws and the Investment
    Company Act of 1940. The Fund pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the
    preferred shares' liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated
    with the preferred auctions.

3   DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS
    The Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
    after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
    Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
    preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
    dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
    Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the Auction
    Preferred Shares on April 30, 2004 was 1.12%, 1.09%, 1.15%, 1.18% and 1.10%,
    for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Shares,
    respectively. For the period from the commencement of the offering, July 25,
    2003, to April 30, 2004, the Fund paid dividends to Auction Preferred
    shareholders amounting to $1,649,266, $1,643,300, $1,658,941, $1,666,304,
    and $1,662,296 for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E
    Shares, respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such
    period of 1.13%, 1.13%, 1.14%, 1.15% and 1.14%, respectively.

    The Fund distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
    reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
    earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
    capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
    distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
    primarily to the different treatment for paydown gain/losses on
    mortgage-backed securities and the method for amortizing premiums.

4   INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
    The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the
    Fund's weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management (EVM), as
    compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
    Fund. For the period from the start of business, May 30, 2003, to April 30,
    2004 the fee was equivalent to 0.75% (annualized) of the Fund's average
    weekly gross assets for such period and amounted to $20,499,825.

    In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for
    fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% (annualized) of average
    weekly gross assets of the Fund for the first five years of the Fund's
    operations 0.15% of average weekly gross assets of the Fund in year 6, 0.10%
    in year 7 and 0.05%% in year 8. For the period from the start of business,
    May 30, 2003, to April 30, 2004 the Investment Adviser waived $5,474,120 of
    its advisory fee.

    EVM serves as the administrator of the Fund, but currently receives no
    compensation for providing administrative services to the Fund.

    Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are officers of the above
    organizations.

5   PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS
    Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations and
    including paydowns, aggregated $5,101,069,210 and $2,003,953,416
    respectively.

6   SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT
    The Fund has established a securities lending agreement with brokers in
    which the Fund lends portfolio securities to a broker in exchange for
    collateral consisting of either cash or U.S. government securities in an
    amount at least equal to the market value of the securities on loan. Under
    the agreement, the Fund continues to earn interest on the securities loaned.
    Collateral received is generally cash, and the Fund invests the cash and
    receives any interest on the amount invested but it must also pay the broker
    a loan rebate fee computed as a varying percentage of the collateral
    received. The loan rebate fee paid by the Fund offsets a portion of the
    interest income received and amounted to $861,336 for the period from the
    start of business, May 30, 2003, to April 30, 2004. At April 30, 2004, the
    value of the securities loaned and the value of the collateral amounted to
    $120,965,769 and $123,955,543, respectively. In the event of counterparty
    default, the Fund is subject to potential loss if it is delayed or prevented
    from exercising its right to dispose of the collateral. The Fund bears risk
    in the event that invested collateral is not sufficient to meet obligations
    due on the loans. The Fund has the right under the lending agreement to
    recover the securities from the borrower on demand.

9   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    The Fund regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
    risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
    exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include
    written options and financial futures contracts, and may involve, to a
    varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for
    financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these
    instruments represent the investment the Fund has in particular classes of
    financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts
    potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with
    these instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting
    transactions are considered. At April 30, 2004 there were no outstanding
    obligations under these financial instruments.

10  ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)
    The Fund held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 20, 2004. The

commissions on all open-market purchases.

Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will

Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

                                            ----------

 Total                                      $   88,921
                                            ==========
</Table>

(1)  Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees.
(2)  Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
     rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax
     advice, and tax planning.
(3)  All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and
     services provided by the principal accountant other than audit,
     audit-related, and tax services.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is

<Page>

specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately
pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of
the registrant's principal accountant.

(e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the
registrant's audit committee pursuant to the "de minimis exception" set forth in
Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) The following table presents (i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees
for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed for services rendered to the
registrant by its principal accountant for the registrant's first fiscal year;
and (ii) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and
other services) billed for services rendered to the Eaton Vance organization for
the registrant's first fiscal year.

</Table>

(1)  Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the
     registrant's investment adviser and administrator.

(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by the
registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Norton H. Reamer (Chair), Samuel L. Hayes, III, William H.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.
