                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the "Fund") is a non-diversified
closed-end  management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation on
May 20, 1986 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "1940  Act"),  whose  primary  objective  is  long-term  growth of capital.
Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

     The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in equity  securities under
normal  market  conditions  (the "80%  Policy").  The 80%  Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval.  The Fund will provide shareholders with notice at
least 60 days prior to the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") so  determines,  by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign  market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities  will be fair valued as  determined  by the Board.  Debt  instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board.  Fair  valuation  methodologies  and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial  information  about the company;  comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign  securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book
entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian.  To the extent
that any  repurchase  transaction  exceeds one  business  day,  the value of the
collateral is  marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the
collateral.  If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral  declines or
if  bankruptcy  proceedings  are  commenced  with  respect  to the seller of the
security,  realization  of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.
At June 30,  2006,  the Fund  had  investments  of  $230,789,000  in  repurchase
agreements.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of  the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to  the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the   counterparty)
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the Fund's  variable rate payment  obligation on Series C Preferred
Stock. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty
and, to the extent that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a predetermined
fixed rate,  would  receive from that  counterparty  payments of the  difference
based  on  the  notional  amount  of  such  cap.  Interest  rate  swap  and  cap
transactions  introduce  additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay  preferred  stock  dividends  when due in  accordance  with the  Articles
Supplementary even if the counterparty  defaulted.  If there is a default by the
counterparty  to a swap  contract,  the  Fund  will be  limited  to  contractual
remedies  pursuant to the  agreements  related to the  transaction.  There is no
assurance  that  the swap  contract  counterparties  will be able to meet  their
obligations  pursuant to a swap contract or that,  in the event of default,  the
Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from  obtaining  payments owed to it
pursuant  to  a  swap  contract.  The  creditworthiness  of  the  swap  contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio  securities  at that point in time,  such a default  could  negatively
affect  the Fund's  ability to make  dividend  payments  for Series C  Preferred
Stock. In addition, at the time an interest rate swap or cap transaction reaches
its scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Fund will not be able
to obtain a replacement  transaction or that the terms of the  replacement  will
not be as  favorable as on the expiring  transaction.  If this occurs,  it could
have a negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments on Series
C Preferred Stock.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with  Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement, the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2006 are as follows:

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against  changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and in the
value of  securities  it  intends  to  purchase.  Upon  entering  into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/depreciation   on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The  Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open
futures contracts.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At June 30, 2006, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books  and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase  securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments,  or currency  repatriation,  a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     RESTRICTED  AND ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The Fund may invest up to 10% of its
net assets in securities for which the markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities
include  securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial  legal or
contractual  restrictions.  The sale of illiquid  securities often requires more
time and  results  in higher  brokerage  charges or dealer  discounts  and other
selling  expenses  than does the sale of  securities  eligible  for  trading  on
national securities  exchanges or in the  over-the-counter  markets.  Restricted
securities  may  sell at a price  lower  than  similar  securities  that are not
subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities  freely saleable among qualified
institutional  investors  under  special  rules  adopted by the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC")  may be  treated  as liquid  if they  satisfy
liquidity  standards  established by the Board. The continued  liquidity of such
securities  is not as well assured as that of publicly  traded  securities,  and
accordingly the Board will monitor their liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN  FEE CREDITS.  When cash  balances are  maintained in the custody
account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to offset custodian fees. The
gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are included in custodian fees
in the Statement of Operations with the  corresponding  expense offset,  if any,
shown as "custodian fee credits".

     DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with Federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value ("NAV") of the Fund. For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, reclassifications were made to decrease
accumulated  net  investment  income  by  $2,052,100  and  decrease  accumulated
distributions in excess of net realized gain on investments,  futures contracts,
swap contracts, and foreign currency transactions by $2,052,100.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  7.20%  Series B  Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, 5.875% Series
D Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred
Stock  ("Cumulative  Preferred  Stock")  are  recorded  on a daily basis and are
determined as described in Note 5.

     The tax  character  of  distributions  paid  during the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2005 was as follows:

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     As of December 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

                  Net unrealized appreciation on investments ....  $253,104,499

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an  annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average
weekly net  assets  including  the  liquidation  value of  preferred  stock.  In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the  management fee on the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

     The Fund's total  return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30, 2006, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares  exceeded
the stated dividend rate or net swap expense of all outstanding Preferred Stock.
Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

     During  the six  months  ended  June  30,  2006,  the Fund  paid  brokerage
commissions  of $116,382 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli & Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

     In connection with the 2005 Rights Offering,  holders of unexercised rights
("Rights")  to  purchase  common  shares of the Fund were able to  instruct  the
Subscription  Agent  (Computershare  Shareholder  Services,  Inc.) to sell  such
Rights on their  behalf.  The  Subscription  Agent was  permitted to effect such
sales  through  Gabelli &  Company,  unless the  Subscription  Agent was able to
negotiate a lower commission rate with an independent broker.  Total commissions
from  sales of Rights  effected  by the  Subscription  Agent  through  Gabelli &
Company amounted to $93,506 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the  Advisory  Agreement  between  the Fund and the  Adviser.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2006,  the Fund paid or accrued  $22,500 to the Adviser in
connection  with the cost of  computing  the Fund's  NAV,  which is  included in
miscellaneous expenses in the Statement of Operations.

     The Fund is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the  Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the  amount of $15,334  for the six months
ended June 30, 2006,  which is included in payroll  expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the six months ended June 30, 2006, other than short-term securities, aggregated
$120,608,180 and $139,322,820, respectively.

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Fund to issue 182,000,000  shares of common
stock (par value  $0.001) and  authorizes  the Board to increase its  authorized
shares from time to time.  The Board has authorized the repurchase of its shares
on the open  market when the shares are trading at a discount of 10% or more (or
such other percentage as the Board may determine from time to time) from the NAV
of the  shares.  During the six months  ended  June 30,  2006,  the Fund did not
repurchase any shares of its common stock in the open market.

     Transactions in common stock were as follows:

     The Fund's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of
up to 18,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the  common  stock and  results in the
financial  leveraging of the common stock. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Articles  Supplementary  to meet certain  asset  coverage  tests with
respect  to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Fund  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not  correct  such  failure,  the Fund may be required to
redeem,  in part or in full,  the 7.20% Series B, Series C Auction Rate,  5.875%
Series D, and Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock at  redemption
prices of $25, $25,000, $25, and $25,000, respectively, per share plus an amount
equal to the  accumulated and unpaid  dividends  whether or not declared on such
shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the
foregoing asset coverage  requirements  could restrict the Fund's ability to pay
dividends to common shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities
at  inopportune  times.  The income  received on the Fund's assets may vary in a
manner  unrelated  to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
common shareholders.

     On September 21, 2005, the Fund distributed one transferable right for each
of the 143,681,301  shares of common stock outstanding to shareholders of record
on that date. Seven rights were required to purchase one additional common share
at the subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders who exercised their
full  primary   subscription  rights  were

eligible for an over-subscription privilege entitling them to subscribe, subject
to certain limitations and a pro-rata  allotment,  for any additional shares not
purchased  pursuant to the primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as
authorized  by the Board in  accordance  with the  registration  statement.  The
subscription  period expired on October 26, 2005. The rights  offering was fully
subscribed,  having received  over-subscription requests in excess of the shares
available  for primary  subscription  resulting  in the  issuance of  20,525,901
shares of common stock and proceeds of  $143,681,307  to the Fund,  prior to the
deduction  of  estimated  expenses  of  $754,685.  The NAV per share of the Fund
common  shareholders was reduced by approximately $0.15 per share as a result of
the issuance of shares below NAV.

     On June 20, 2001,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $159,329,175  (after
underwriting discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325) from the
public  offering of  6,600,000  shares of 7.20%  Series B  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Commencing  June 20, 2006 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option,  may
redeem the 7.20% Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time. On June 26, 2006,  the Fund, as authorized by the
Board,  redeemed  25%  (1,650,000  shares)  of its  outstanding  7.20%  Series B
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock at the  redemption  price of  $25.00  per  share of
Preferred Stock (the liquidation  value),  plus accumulated and unpaid dividends
through the redemption date of $0.45 per Preferred  Share.  The Preferred Shares

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

redemption  price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30,  2006,  the
Fund did not  redeem any shares of Series E Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  At June 30,  2006,  2,000  shares of Series E  Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred Stock were outstanding  with an annualized  dividend rate of 5.26% per
share and accrued dividends amounted to $7,306.

     The holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class.  The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain  circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Directors.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. REORGANIZATION. On September 13, 2005, the Fund acquired substantially all of
the  net  assets  of  the  Sterling   Capital  Corp.   pursuant  to  a  Plan  of
Reorganization  approved by Sterling  Capital Corp.  on September 12, 2005.  The
acquisition was  accomplished by a tax-free  exchange of 1,978,190 common shares
of the Fund valued at  $18,306,860  for the net assets of the  Sterling  Capital
Corp. on September 12, 2005. Sterling Capital Corp.'s net assets of $18,306,860,
including $2,191,264 of unrealized appreciation, were combined with those of the
Fund on  September  13,  2005.  The net  assets  attributable  to  common  stock
shareholders of the Fund immediately before the acquisition were $1,273,163,812.

8. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund trading  practices  involving  certain funds managed by the Adviser.
GAMCO Investors,  Inc. ("GAMCO"), the Adviser's parent company, is responding to
these  requests  for  documents  and  testimony.   In  June  2006,  GAMCO  began
discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry. Since
these discussions are ongoing, it cannot be determined at this time whether they
will ultimately  result in a settlement of this matter. On a separate matter, in
September  2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the SEC that the staff
may recommend to the  Commission  that an  administrative  remedy and a monetary
penalty be sought  from the  Adviser in  connection  with the  actions of two of
seven closed-end funds managed by the Adviser relating to Section 19(a) and Rule
19a-1 of the 1940 Act. These provisions require registered  investment companies
to provide  written  statements to  shareholders  when a dividend is made from a
source other than net investment  income.  While the two  closed-end  funds sent
annual statements and provided other materials containing this information,  the
funds did not send written  statements to shareholders with each distribution in
2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that all of the funds are now in compliance.
The Adviser  believes that these matters would have no effect on the Fund or any
material  adverse  effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the Fund.  The
staff's notice to the Adviser did not relate to the Fund.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

Section  15(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940
Act"),  contemplates  that the Board of Directors  (the  "Board") of The Gabelli
Equity Trust Inc. (the  "Fund"),  including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment  advisory agreement and are not
"interested  persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the  "Independent
Board Members"), are required to annually review and re-approve the terms of the
Fund's  existing  investment  advisory  agreement and approve any newly proposed
terms therein.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed and re-approved,  during the
most recent six month period  covered by this report,  the  Investment  Advisory
Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") for
the Fund.

More specifically,  at a meeting held on May 17, 2006, the Board,  including the
Independent  Board Members,  considered the factors and reached the  conclusions
described  below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the re-approval of
the Advisory Agreement.

NATURE,   EXTENT,  AND  QUALITY  OF  SERVICES.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered the nature,  quality,  and extent of  administrative  and shareholder
services performed by the Adviser,  including portfolio management,  supervision
of Fund  operations and compliance  and  regulatory  filings and  disclosures to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund legal
issues,  assisting the Independent Board Members in their capacity as directors,
and other services.  The Independent  Board Members  concluded that the services
are extensive in nature and that the Adviser consistently delivered a high level
of service.

INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND AND ADVISER.  The Independent  Board Members
considered  short-term and long-term  investment  performance  for the Fund over
various  periods of time as compared  to both  relevant  equity  indices and the
performance  of the Fund's  Lipper,  Inc.  peer group,  and  concluded  that the
Adviser was delivering  satisfactory  performance  results  consistent  with the
investment strategies being pursued by the Fund.


COSTS OF SERVICES AND PROFITS REALIZED BY THE ADVISER.

(A) COSTS OF SERVICES TO FUND: FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Independent Board Members
considered  the Fund's  advisory fee rate and expense ratio relative to industry
averages for the Fund's peer group category and the advisory fees charged by the
Adviser and its affiliates to other fund and non-fund  clients.  The Independent
Board  Members noted that the mix of services  under the Advisory  Agreement are
much more  extensive  than those  under the  advisory  agreements  for  non-fund
clients.  The Independent Board Members recognized that the advisory fee paid by
the Fund and the Fund's  overall  expense ratio are higher than the averages for
its  peer  group,  but  concluded  that  the fee is  acceptable  based  upon the
qualifications, experience, reputation, and performance of the Adviser.

(B)  PROFITABILITY  AND COSTS OF  SERVICES  TO ADVISER.  The  Independent  Board
Members considered the Adviser's overall  profitability and costs, and pro-forma
estimates of the Adviser's  profitability and costs attributable to the Fund (i)
as part of the Gabelli fund complex and (ii) assuming the Fund  constituted  the
Adviser's only investment  company under its management.  The Independent  Board
Members also considered  whether the amount of profit is a fair  entrepreneurial
profit  for  the  management  of the  Fund,  and  noted  that  the  Adviser  has
substantially  increased  its  resources  devoted to Fund matters in response to
regulatory   requirements  and  enhanced  Fund  policies  and  procedures.   The
Independent Board Members  concluded that the Adviser's  profitability was at an
acceptable level.

                                       24
<PAGE>

EXTENT OF  ECONOMIES  OF SCALE AS FUND  GROWS.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered  whether  there  have been  economies  of scale  with  respect to the
management of the Fund and whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from any
economies of scale. The Independent  Board Members noted that economies of scale
may develop for certain  funds as their  assets  increase  and their  fund-level
expenses  decline as a percentage of assets,  but that  fund-level  economies of
scale may not necessarily result in Adviser-level economies of scale. Aware that
the Adviser waives fees  attributable to the liquidation  value of the preferred
shares if the total  return of the common  shares  does not  exceed a  specified
amount,  the Independent  Board Members  concluded that there was an appropriate
sharing of economies of scale.

WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT  ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The  Independent  Board Members
also  considered  whether the advisory fee rate is reasonable in relation to the
asset size of the Fund and any economies of scale that may exist,  and concluded
that it currently was reasonable.


OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS.

(A) ADVISER PERSONNEL AND METHODS.  The Independent Board Members considered the
size,   education,   and  experience  of  the  Adviser's  staff,  the  Adviser's
fundamental  research  capabilities,  and the Adviser's  approach to recruiting,
training,  and retaining  portfolio  managers and other  research and management
personnel,  and concluded that in each of these areas the Adviser was structured
in such a way to support the high level of services being provided to the Fund.

(B) OTHER BENEFITS TO THE ADVISER. The Independent Board Members also considered
the character and amount of other  incidental  benefits  received by the Adviser
and its affiliates  from its association  with the Fund. The  Independent  Board
Members  considered  the  brokerage  commissions  paid  to an  affiliate  of the
Adviser.  The  Independent  Board Members  concluded that  potential  "fall-out"
benefits  that the Adviser and its  affiliates  may receive,  such as affiliated
brokerage commissions,  greater name recognition, or increased ability to obtain
research services, appear to be reasonable.

CONCLUSIONS.  In  considering  the Advisory  Agreement,  the  Independent  Board
Members did not  identify any factor as  all-important  or  all-controlling  and
instead considered these factors collectively in light of the Fund's surrounding
circumstances.  Based on this  review,  it was the  judgment of the  Independent
Board Members that  shareholders  had received  over the long term  satisfactory
absolute and relative performance at reasonable fees and, therefore, re-approval
of the  Advisory  Agreement  was in the  best  interests  of the  Fund  and  its
shareholders.  As a part of its decision making process,  the Independent  Board
Members noted that the Adviser has managed the Fund since its inception, and the
Independent Board Members believe that a long-term  relationship with a capable,
conscientious  adviser is in the best  interests  of the Fund.  The  Independent
Board Members  considered,  generally,  that  shareholders  invested in the Fund
knowing that the Adviser managed the Fund and knowing its advisory fee schedule.
As such, the Independent Board Members  considered,  in particular,  whether the
Adviser  managed  the Fund in  accordance  with its  investment  objectives  and
policies as disclosed to shareholders.  The Independent  Board Members concluded
that  the  Fund was  managed  by the  Adviser  consistent  with  its  investment
objectives and policies.  Upon  conclusion of their review and  discussion,  the
Independent  Board Members  unanimously  agreed to recommend the continuation of
the Investment Advisory Agreement for the Fund.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN
ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

  It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli   Equity  Trust  Inc.  (the  "Fund")  to
automatically   reinvest   dividends.   As  a   "registered"   shareholder   you
automatically become a participant in the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment
Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan authorizes the Fund to issue shares of common stock
to  participants  upon  an  income  dividend  or a  capital  gains  distribution
regardless  of whether  the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net
asset value. All  distributions  to shareholders  whose shares are registered in
their  own  names  will be  automatically  reinvested  pursuant  to the  Plan in
additional   shares  of  the  Fund.  Plan  participants  may  send  their  stock
certificates to Computershare Trust Company,  N.A.  ("Computershare") to be held
in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.  Registered  shareholders  wishing to
receive their distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                          The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc.
                               c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                           Providence, RI 02940-3010

  Shareholders requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's name
and  address  as  they  appear  on  the  share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional  questions  regarding  the Plan, or requesting a copy of the terms of
the Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

  If your shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank, or nominee, you should
contact such institution.  If such institution is not participating in the Plan,
your account will be credited with a cash  dividend.  In order to participate in
the Plan through  such  institution,  it may be  necessary  for you to have your
shares  taken out of  "street  name" and  re-registered  in your own name.  Once
registered in your own name your  dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested.
Certain brokers participate in the Plan.  Shareholders holding shares in "street
name"  at   participating   institutions   will  have  dividends   automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

  The number of shares of common stock  distributed to  participants in the Plan
in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the Plan,
whenever the market price of the Fund's  common stock is equal to or exceeds net
asset value at the time shares are valued for purposes of determining the number
of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends  or  capital  gains  distribution,
participants  are issued shares of common stock valued at the greater of (i) the
net asset  value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of the then  current
market price of the Fund's common stock.  The valuation  date is the dividend or
distribution  payment  date or,  if that date is not a New York  Stock  Exchange
("NYSE") trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of the common
stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market  price of the common  stock,
participants  will receive  shares from the Fund valued at market price.  If the
Fund should  declare a dividend or capital  gains  distribution  payable only in
cash,  Computershare will buy common stock in the open market, or on the NYSE or
elsewhere,  for the  participants'  accounts,  except  that  Computershare  will
endeavor to  terminate  purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue
shares at net asset value if, following the commencement of such purchases,  the
market value of the common stock exceeds the then current net asset value.

  The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gains  distributions will
not  relieve  participants  of any  income  tax  which  may be  payable  on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

  The Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate  the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
written  notice of the change  sent to the  members of the Plan at least 90 days
before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The Plan also may be
amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days' written  notice to
participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

  The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another  vehicle for our  shareholders
to  increase  their  investment  in the  Fund.  In order to  participate  in the
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  shareholders must have their shares registered in
their own name.

  Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's shares
at the then current market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from $250 to
$10,000.  Computershare  will use  these  funds to  purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will  charge
each shareholder who participates  $0.75, plus a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary cash payments be sent to  Computershare,  P.O. Box 43010,  Providence,
RI 02940-3010 such that  Computershare  receives such payments  approximately 10
days before the 1st and 15th of the month. Funds not received at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment  until the next purchase
date.  A payment  may be  withdrawn  without  charge if  notice is  received  by
Computershare at least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

  SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE  must do so in
writing or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

  For more information  regarding the Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Fund.

  The Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plans as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
written  notice of the change  sent to the  members of the Plan at least 90 days
before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The Plan also may be
amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days' written  notice to
participants in the Plan.
