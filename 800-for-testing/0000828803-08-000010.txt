                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management groups--
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                              Templeton offers investors a truly global
                              perspective.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                              it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                              arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to different investment approaches,
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                              typically have distinct portfolios. That's why our
                              funds can be used to build truly diversified
                              allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                              that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                              names in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +15.24% based on market price and +14.11% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of +4.67% in local currency terms
and +12.86% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period. 1 You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

The six-month period was marked by rising delinquencies in U.S. subprime
mortgages, broader global credit deleveraging and the resulting fallout on the
global economy and financial markets. In an environment of heightened
uncertainty, equity and credit markets broadly came under pressure while
developed bond markets benefited from flight to quality. Additionally, the U.S.
dollar depreciated further while commodity prices continued to rise.

The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (Fed) aggressively cut interest rates over the
past six months to mitigate the credit shock and housing market slump's negative
effects. The Fed cut the federal funds target rate 225 basis points (bps) from
5.25% to 3.00% by period-end. U.S. economic growth slowed to an annualized 0.6%
in fourth quarter 2007, accompanied by significant declines in consumer
confidence as housing prices contracted and the labor market began shedding
jobs. While slower domestic demand growth relieved pressure on the widening U.S.
current account deficit, the deficit's magnitude remained difficult to finance
through capital inflows amid slower growth prospects and lower short-term
interest rates, adding to depreciation pressure on the U.S. dollar.

The euro hit a record high against the U.S. dollar, reaching $1.52 per euro, due
to relative growth and interest rates. 2 The European Central Bank (ECB)
provided increased liquidity to the European banking system to help alleviate
the global credit crunch's impact. As a result, the ECB focused on inflation
risks and left interest rates unchanged at 4.00% over the period. Higher energy
and food prices pushed consumer price growth to 3.2% in January 2008, above the
ECB's 2.0% inflation target. 3 Economic growth across Europe moderated due to
the effects of previous interest rate hikes and slower growth among key

trading partners. Additionally, eurozone economic growth moderated to 2.2% in
fourth quarter 2007 year-over-year as higher inflation eroded consumers'
purchasing power and consumption dropped for the first time in six years. 4
Non-euro Europe's economic growth remained mostly stronger than in euro
economies resulting from stronger investment growth and tighter labor markets.
For example, Norway's, Poland's and Sweden's economies grew 6.3%, 6.1% and 2.8%,
respectively, in fourth quarter 2007 year-over-year. 5 Rising wage and cost
pressures prompted these economies' central banks to continue hiking interest
rates despite the global credit crisis.

China remained an important contributor to Asia's continued robust growth. Gross
domestic product (GDP) grew 11.2% in fourth quarter 2007 year-over-year.
Economic growth remained reasonably strong in other countries, rising 7.3% in
Malaysia, 5.5% in South Korea and 5.4% in Singapore, over the same period. 6
Chinese monetary authorities continued to tighten credit conditions through
various channels including increasing interest rates 45 bps over the period.
However, inflation pressures picked up, primarily reflecting higher global
commodity prices, and China's consumer price inflation jumped to 8.7%
year-over-year in February 2008. 7 Asia continued to generate large current
account surpluses and accumulate foreign exchange reserves. With increased risk
aversion and volatile equity performance, sovereign wealth funds helped provide
stability to U.S. and European financial systems through bank recapitalization.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

WHAT IS DURATION?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In
general, a portfolio of securities with a lower duration can be expected to be
less sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a higher duration.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS A CARRY TRADE?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carry trade is a strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a
relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency
yielding a higher interest rate. A trader using this strategy attempts to
capture the difference between the rates.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

Banking sector tensions and flight to quality drove treasury yields lower in
developed bond markets during the six months under review while financial market
contagion pushed yields higher in some emerging bond markets. While economic
activity remained reasonably positive outside the U.S., we extended duration in
countries where we believed the market was too optimistic in its expectations
for the economy to fully decouple from global credit market events or the U.S.
economic slowdown. Two examples are Mexico and South Korea. As a U.S. neighbor,
the Mexican economy has strong economic links to the U.S. economy given the
mobility of goods, labor and capital flows. Mexico's long-term bond yields fell
31 bps while its bond market returned +5.55% in local currency terms as measured
by the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Bond Index (GBI) Broad. 8 In South Korea, the
central bank has increased interest rates a cumulative 100 basis points over the
past two years, and the market has been pricing in a continuation of this
tightening cycle. However, in our view, the combination of strong trade links to
the U.S. and moderating domestic growth could lead to a South Korean economic
slowdown. Therefore, we viewed South Korean interest rates as attractive and
added exposure. We believe our South Korean position could also benefit from
potential cyclical undercurrents in China following policy tightening amid
global recoupling and the risk of asset price corrections. South Korean
long-term bond yields fell 34 bps during the period and the bond market returned
+4.26% in local currency terms according to the JPM GBI Broad. 8 Fund
positioning with respect to interest rates and duration broadly detracted from
Fund returns over the period largely due to our underweighted position in
developed markets at the onset of the global credit shock. We continued to avoid
markets where we believed valuations were stretched such as in the U.S. However,
this worked against the Fund's relative performance as the U.S. Treasury market
returned +8.39% as measured by the Citigroup World Government Bond Index (WGBI)
in local currency terms. 9

CURRENCY STRATEGY

The U.S. dollar fell 8.42% against its major trading partners during the
six-month period as the U.S. failed to attract sufficient capital flows to
finance its 5.1% of GDP current account deficit. 10 The Fund benefited from its
long-held pessimistic view on the U.S. dollar. Reflecting our increasingly
cautious outlook

on global and financial markets, we increased exposure to currencies with large
current account surpluses that were previously used to fund the carry trade,
such as the Japanese yen or Swiss franc. These currencies benefited from rising
volatility in global markets. The Japanese yen rose 11.34% against the U.S.
dollar and the Swiss franc 15.76%, benefiting the Fund's relative performance. 2
Additionally, key currency positions generated strong positive gains against the
U.S. dollar, including the Polish zloty, Brazilian real, Swedish krona and
Malaysian ringgit, which rose 21.17%, 16.36%, 11.64% and 9.61%, respectively. 2

We continued to see greater value in non-euro currencies than the euro, and
these currencies' gains helped offset the relative impact of being underweighted
in the euro, compared with the benchmark, at a time when the euro hit record
highs against the U.S. dollar. During the period, the euro rose 11.36% against
the U.S. dollar. 2 Near the end of the reporting period, we used this euro
strength to hedge a portion of the implicit euro currency risk in the
portfolio's non-euro European positions. Since the beginning of 2002, the euro
has appreciated against the U.S. dollar from a rate of $0.89 per euro to $1.52
by the end of February 2008, or a cumulative 71% increase. 2 Rising global
demand and a strong profit environment over that period has helped the eurozone
cope with a stronger currency. However, we believed the euro may become
vulnerable to a more challenging global growth environment given the extent of
what we assessed as euro overvaluation. We continued to believe the U.S. dollar
is still undergoing a multi-year weak currency cycle as global imbalances
unwind. However, we found more value in Asian currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar given the magnitude of the regional imbalances, as reflected by a large
current account deficit in the U.S. and large current surpluses in Asia.

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also invested in investment-grade and subinvestment-grade sovereign
debt. As an asset class, these investments typically compensate for greater
credit risk by offering higher yields relative to U.S. and European benchmark
treasury yield curves. U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt generated a
six-month return of +5.51% as measured by the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index
Global (EMBIG). 11 Sovereign interest rate spreads rose from 235 bps at the
beginning of the reporting period to 306 bps by period-end, as emerging market
credit yields fell less than U.S. Treasury yields because of Fed rate cuts. The
Fund had limited exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt given
valuations, but we noted that credit fundamentals have improved over the past
few years as shown by reserve accumulation, more supportive economic policies
and improved debt ratios.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED OR DELAYED DELIVERY BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis,
with payment and delivery scheduled for a future date. These transactions are
subject to market fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at
delivery may be more or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the
Fund will generally purchase these securities with the intention of holding the
securities, it may sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient
assets have been segregated for these securities.

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS (CONTINUED)

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. OPTIONS

The Fund may purchase or write options. Options are contracts entitling the
holder to purchase or sell securities, currencies, or other financial
instruments at a specified price or for a fixed currency amount. Options
purchased are recorded as investments; options written (sold) are recorded as
liabilities. Upon closing of an option, other than by exercise, which results in
a cash settlement, the difference between the premium (original option value)
and the settlement proceeds is realized as a gain or loss. When securities are
acquired or delivered upon exercise of an option, the acquisition cost or sale
proceeds are adjusted by the amount of the premium. When an option expires, the
premium is realized as a gain for options written or as a loss for options
purchased. The risks include the possibility there may be an illiquid options
market or the inability of the counterparties to fulfill their obligations under
the contract. Writing options involves, to varying degrees, elements of market
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

F. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

G. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and
are determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These differences may be permanent or

temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts to
reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no impact on net
assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified,
as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases in
the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by amounts
corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments, including
adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest income.

H. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

I. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At February 29, 2008, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized
(without par value). Transactions in the Fund's shares were as follows:

</TABLE>

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through February 29, 2008, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the periods ended August 31,
2007 and February 29, 2008, there were no shares repurchased.

primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, and bond discounts and premiums.

9. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 19.26% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

10. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

11. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares (marketing support), Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental entities.
Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among others,
concerning market timing and marketing support.

On June 6, 2007, the SEC posted for public comment the proposed plan of
distribution for the market timing settlement. Once the SEC approves the final
plan of distribution, disbursements of settlement monies will be made promptly
to individuals who were shareholders of the designated funds during the relevant
period, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement and plan

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Funds, it is
committed to making the Funds or their shareholders whole, as appropriate.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48), on February 29, 2008. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement,
recognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with
accounting for the related interest and penalties. The Fund has reviewed the tax
positions for each of the three open tax years as of August 31, 2007 and has
determined that the implementation of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on
the Fund's financial statements.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement"
(SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Fund believes the adoption of SFAS 157
will have no material impact on its financial statements.

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, of applying the various provisions of SFAS 161.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; share
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically; BNY
Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on NYSE Euronext (formerly the New
York Stock Exchange) or otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8009,
Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator shall apply such
payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees)
to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on NYSE Euronext or otherwise on the open market,
each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees. Trading fees will
be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan Administrator's fee for a sale
of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per transaction plus a $0.12 per share
trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O.
Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8035. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of
another independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy
directly to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If
the conflict is not resolved by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter,
along with the recommended course of action by the manager to an
interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include portfolio managers
and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting
instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation
of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider
of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group
or the Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trusteesor a
committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Sections 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the Investment Manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
