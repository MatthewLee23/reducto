                            OF SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits mutual funds to deliver
only one copy of shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements
and shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same
residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
"householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

From time to time mutual funds are required to vote proxies related to the
securities held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying
Portfolios vote proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved
by the Funds' and Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these
policies and procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]
PRESIDENT

In our shareholder reports, we refer frequently to "quality spreads" and their
important role in bond analysis. However, while followed closely by bond
analysts and portfolio managers, this aspect of municipal bond investing is
generally overlooked by individual investors. As part of our continuing
educational series, we thought it might be instructive to discuss quality
spreads and why they constitute a key variable for investors in the municipal
bond market.

Quality spreads: compensation for added credit risk...

The term "quality spread" refers to the difference in yields between bonds of
varying quality, but similar maturities. A bond rated BBB, for example, should
have a higher yield than an insured bond rated AAA because investors who buy
lower-quality bonds anticipate being paid for accepting a higher level of credit
risk. That risk premium comes in the form of higher yields. Spreads are
typically stated in basis points, or 1/100's of a percentage point. Thus, a bond
yielding 5.00% trades at a spread of 100 basis points (1.00%) over a bond that
yields 4.00%.

Spread fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors...

Spreads fluctuate with changes in market conditions, with many factors
influencing spread relationships. The quality and type of bond are primary
factors. For example, an insured general obligation rated AAA - with no credit
risk - will trade at a significantly lower yield than a BBB rated industrial
bond, which has a significantly higher credit risk. Naturally, a bond's price
will respond to changes that may impact - for better or worse - the underlying
fundamentals of an issuer. Remember, bond yields move in the opposite direction
of bond prices.

Another factor that influences spreads is supply. Assuming stable demand,
spreads are likely to widen if the supply for a specific issuer increases, as
the market must now digest a larger volume of bonds. Similarly, if supply
declines, spreads may narrow, as investors may be willing to pay more for a
credit that is increasingly scarce.

Finally, quality spreads may fluctuate with changes in the overall economy. For
example, spreads tend to narrow as the economy strengthens and the revenue
outlook improves. On the other hand, as the economy slows or enters recession,
spreads tend to widen, as investors become increasingly worried about the
direction of the economy and its impact on bonds with higher credit risk.

Spreads constitute a key factor in investment decisions...

Quality spreads have a significant influence on the investment decisions of
municipal bond portfolio managers. The widening of spreads may suggest a
developing opportunity. If spreads have widened appreciably, the investor may
detect an unusual opportunity in a lower-quality, higher-yielding bond.
Conversely, if lower-quality bonds have significantly outperformed high-quality
bonds over a period, the resulting narrowing of spreads may signal the need for
caution. This "spread compression" may prompt portfolio managers to upgrade
their portfolios with higher quality bonds because they are no longer being
adequately compensated for the risk of owning lower-quality bonds.

While quality spreads are a key metric for municipal bond investors, they
represent just one of many factors considered in establishing a diversified bond
portfolio. At Eaton Vance, we realize that complex markets require intensive
research, a need that emphasizes once again the value of experienced,
professional portfolio management.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

MARKET RECAP

The U.S. economy, which has slumped badly in recent years, remained sluggish in
the first half of 2003, although there were sporadic signs of improvement. A
continued decline in interest rates to their lowest level in 45 years helped
fuel rallies in the financial markets. The conclusion of official hostilities in
Iraq and the passage of a Tax Bill gave investors added confidence. Capital
spending remained well below past recovery rates, although some businesses
indicated that they were starting to commit new investment toward equipment.

While there were signs of spotty growth, the overall economy failed to gain
traction...

The manufacturing sector turned in a mixed showing, characterized by weak
demand. The auto and textile areas registered declines, while construction and
defense-related manufacturing were fairly strong. Boosted by the lowest mortgage
rates in a decade, the construction sector was fairly strong. Growth was limited
to the residential segment, however, as commercial investment continued to
slump. Consumer spending remained lackluster despite a modest rebound in retail
activity following the end of the war in Iraq. However, retail sales were below
the levels of a year earlier.

The Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative monetary policy...

Gross Domestic Product expanded 1.9% in the first quarter of 2003, following a
1.4% rise in the fourth quarter of 2002. As the economy struggled, businesses
reported more layoffs in response to still-weak demand. The nation's
unemployment rate climbed to 6.1% in May 2003, the highest monthly jobless rate
since July 1994. Not surprisingly, inflation has remained quite tame. In fact,
many economists have pointed to DE-flation as a more worrisome threat. In that
environment, the Federal Reserve has maintained an accommodative monetary
posture. The Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate barometer -
stood at 1.25%, at May 31, 2003 and was lowered to 1.00%, a 45-year low in June.
Ten-year Treasury bond yields - which were 5.04% at May 31, 2002 - declined to
3.39% by May 31, 2003, in response to the tepid economy. The sharp decline in
rates was greeted warmly by investors wary of the volatile equity markets and
helped to sustain a rally in bonds. The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index had
a total return of 6.46% for the six months ended May 31, 2003.*

While Federal Tax rates have fallen, state taxes have been on the rise...

While interest rates remain near historical lows, the likelihood of a sharp
increase in rates in the near term is fairly remote. Core inflation - the major
nemesis of the bond market - has been dealt a blow by a weak economy and,
importantly, by the longer-term influence of global competition. Meanwhile, the
rationale for tax-exempt income remains intact. Even as federal tax rates have
been reduced, state governments - most of which have constitutional mandates to
balance their budgets - have enacted property and income tax increases to make
up for revenue shortfalls. As a result, we believe that municipal bonds will
continue to merit a place in the investment portfolios of tax-conscious
investors.

Management Discussion

- - California's economic outlook has been complicated by the state's enormous
  budget deficit. State and local governments have instituted furloughs and wage
  cuts to deal with anticipated revenue shortfalls. Meanwhile, consumer
  confidence weakened amid a stagnant technology outlook. The state's May 2003
  jobless rate was 6.6%, unchanged from a year ago.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) constituted the Trust's largest sector
  weighting at May 31, 2003. Given the state's budgetary issues, the insured*
  nature of the bonds adds an additional layer of protection, with these bonds
  representing a dependable revenue stream.

- - Insured* transportation bonds remained a large investment for the Trust. Given
  the state's vast geography, the efficient transport of passengers and freight
  is a key segment of California's economy. The Trust's investments included
  issues for ports, airport authorities, mass transit and selected Puerto Rico
  highway issues.

- - Special tax revenue bonds constituted a major commitment for the Trust and
  provided an attractive income source. These issues financed a broad array of
  public programs such as road construction and water facilities.

- - The Trust was well served by its broad diversification. In addition to
  diversifying according to issuer, sector and insurer, management had a mixed
  coupon allocation, balancing income-oriented higher-coupons with
  performance-minded low- and zero-coupons.

Management Discussion

- - Florida's economy posted modest growth in the first half of 2003. Construction
  activity was strong, driven by low interest rates. However, while somewhat
  improved, the performance of Florida's travel and tourism industry has not yet
  returned to 2000 levels. The state's jobless rate was 5.1% in May 2003, down
  from 5.5% a year ago.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were the Trust's largest weighting at May 31,
  2003. Transportation facilities are a key element of Florida's tourism
  economy, and provide the infrastructure needed for the state's continuing
  population growth. The Trust's holdings included issues for airports, port
  facilities and highways.

- - Management maintained a large exposure to essential services bonds, including
  insured* water and sewer bonds. These bonds are backed by revenues from water
  and sewer bill payments, which tend to be relatively stable compared to
  cyclical sources of income.

- - Insured* special tax revenue bonds constituted another major investment for
  the Trust. These issues provided local communities a financing mechanism for a
  wide variety of public initiatives, including utility, water and road
  projects.

- - Management continued its efforts to upgrade the Trust's call protection. As
  rates decline, there is a growing likelihood that some bonds may be called
  prior to maturity, causing the proceeds to be invested at lower interest
  rates. That has increased the importance of maintaining good call protection.

Management Discussion

- - The Massachusetts economy struggled in early 2003. Manufacturing of consumer
  durables was especially weak, while slow technology sales reflected slow
  capital spending. Temporary staffing showed some growth, as weary employers
  opted for outsourcing. The Commonwealth's May 2003 jobless rate was 5.5%,
  lower than the national rate, but above the 5.1% rate of a year ago.

- - The education and insured* education sectors are characteristically regarded
  as defensive in a slowing economy. The Trust focused on bonds of well-regarded
  institutions - at the university and secondary level - with continuing strong
  applicant demand.

- - Hospital bonds represented a large commitment for the Trust. The competitive
  Massachusetts hospital market has felt increasing pressure to reduce costs.
  The Trust emphasized institutions with sound financial structures, good
  management and the ability to offer attractive health care specialties.

- - Insured* transportation bonds remained significant investments. The Trust's
  transportation holdings included issues for the Commonwealth's turnpike
  authority, which enjoys fairly consistent toll revenues in any economic
  environment.

- - The Trust generally avoided obligations of the Commonwealth, which may be
  subject to downgrades of credit ratings. In addition, management took
  advantage of strong retail demand to sell selected coupons and adjust the
  overall coupon structure of the Trust.

Management Discussion

- - Michigan's economy reflected the uncertainties seen elsewhere in the nation.
  Manufacturing growth was uneven, as the key auto industry battled rising
  inventories. Home-building was a source of strength, although commercial
  construction remained weak. The state's May 2003 jobless rate rose to 6.7%,
  well above last year's 6.2% rate.

- - The Trust's largest sector concentration was in hospital bonds. Management
  remained very selective with respect to hospital investments, focusing on the
  more competitive institutions, with favorable cost structures, in-demand care
  specialties and strategic alliances with other hospitals.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) and general obligations remained a major
  focus for the Trust. In a slow economy, many states and municipalities have
  encountered a shortfall in income and sales tax receipts. In that climate,
  insured* GOs provided some insulation from revenue-related uncertainties.

- - Insured* transportation bonds were a significant investment. The Trust's
  investments included airport issues for the Wayne County facility that
  services the Detroit metropolitan area, as well as selected Puerto Rico
  highway bonds.

- - Management continued its efforts to improve the Trust's call protection. With
  the significant decline in interest rates and quickening pace of
  pre-refundings, call protection has become an increasingly important strategic
  consideration.

Management Discussion

- - The New Jersey economy showed tentative signs of recovery in the first half of
  2003. Business services, trade and leisure generated above-average job growth.
  However, manufacturing again posted declines, with the metals area especially
  weak. The state's May 2003 jobless rate was 5.6%, lower than the national rate
  and down slightly from the 5.8% rate of a year ago.

- - Insured* transportation bonds represented the Trust's largest sector weighting
  at May 31, 2003. The Trust's transportation holdings included an issue for the
  state's turnpike authority, which enjoys fairly consistent toll revenues in
  any economic environment.

- - Hospital bonds were among the Trust's major investments. Management focused on
  institutions that either dominate their urban markets or are sole providers in
  suburban or rural areas, with minimal competition. These hospitals have
  generally been less vulnerable to the competitive pressures characterizing the
  industry.

- - Education bonds remained a major focus of the Trust's investments. Management
  emphasized institutions with high applications-to-admissions ratios that are
  able to generate consistent, stable tuition revenues.

- - In a very strong retail market, management sold a range of in-demand coupons,
  thereby adjusting the Trust's coupon structure to reflect the decline in
  interest rates. In addition, with quality spreads having narrowed appreciably,
  management has made an effort to upgrade quality within the Trust.

Management Discussion

- - The New York economy reported mixed results, with signs of an emerging
  recovery. The retail sector was weak, as consumers remained skeptical.
  However, construction-related areas were fairly robust. The financial sector
  reported job growth, as the equity markets staged an impressive rally. The
  state's May 2003 jobless rate was 6.1%, unchanged from a year ago.

- - Insured* transportation bonds remained the Trust's largest sector weighting at
  May 31, 2003. While the slow economy has resulted in slower freight and
  passenger traffic, the Trust focused on thruway, port facilities and airports
  that are well-positioned to weather the weaker climate.

- - The Trust was selective within the hospital sector, given the industry's
  continuing challenges. Management focused on bonds of well-managed facilities,
  diversified among county and local issuers, as well as by coupon distribution.

- - Escrowed bonds were among the Trust's largest commitments. Escrowed bonds are
  pre-refunded to their approaching call dates and, thus, continue to deliver
  above-average income. Because they are backed by Treasury bonds, escrowed
  bonds are considered to be of the highest quality.

- - Call protection remained a priority of the Trust. Management sought to
  eliminate bonds with poor call features in favor of noncallable bonds or those
  with superior call protection. Adequate call protection allows bonds to
  participate more fully in market rallies.

Management Discussion

- - Economic activity remained mixed in Ohio, with some industries strengthening
  while others deteriorated. Selected manufacturers enjoyed rising production,
  while residential construction saw strong gains over last year. Retailers,
  meanwhile, reported weak demand, exemplified by slumping auto sales. The
  state's May 2003 jobless rate was 6.1%, up from 5.9% a year ago.

- - Hospital bonds constituted the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2003. In a highly competitive, managed-care environment, the Trust continued
  to focus on institutions we believe have a sound financial underpinning,
  experienced management and a good marketing strategy.

- - Insured* general obligations (GOs) were a significant commitment for the
  Trust. These insured* issues are generally prized by investors, especially at
  a time when the weak economy has continued to pressure industrial and
  economically-sensitive issuers.

- - Insured* education bonds represented a large commitment for the Trust. These
  issues, which financed the construction of classroom and dormitories for
  universities throughout the state, are typically less vulnerable to an
  economic slowdown than cyclical bonds.

- - Puerto Rico bonds played a role in management's efforts to maintain a broad
  diversification. The Trust's Puerto Rico holdings included insured* general
  obligations and transportation bonds, as well as uninsured infrastructure
  bonds.

Management Discussion

- - Uncertainty characterized Pennsyl-vania's economy in the first half of 2003,
  as manufacturers reported declines in orders, while retail sales were below
  last year's pace. Meanwhile, residential building was surprisingly strong,
  while the commercial side lagged. The state's May 2003 jobless rate was 5.6%,
  unchanged from a year ago.

- - Insured* education bonds were the Trust's largest sector weighting at May 31,
  2003, providing excellent quality and stable revenues in an uncertain economic
  climate. The Trust's holdings included issues for the state university system
  as well as prominent private institutions.

- - The Trust maintained a large exposure to insured* general obligations (GOs).
  In a period characterized by lower wages and weaker consumer spending,
  insured* GOs provided an extra measure of security against the likelihood of
  declining state and municipal revenues.

- - Insured* water and sewer bonds have played a prominent role in the Trust.
  These issues are often sought by investors in a slow economy because they
  finance an essential service and are less vulnerable to cutbacks in consumer
  spending.

- - With the dramatic decline in interest rates increasing call risk, management
  emphasized non-callable bonds and bonds with favorable call characteristics.
  The calling of older, higher-coupon bonds has made call protection an
  important consideration for investors.

The Trust

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS

- - Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
  total return of 13.28% for the six months ended May 31, 2003. That return was
  the result of an increase in share price from $13.96 on November 30, 2002 to
  $15.32 on May 31, 2003, and the reinvestment of $0.465 in regular monthly
  dividends.(2)

- - Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 11.69% for the six
  months ended May 31, 2003. That return was the result of an increase in net
  asset value from $14.26 on November 30, 2002 to $15.43 on May 31, 2003, and
  the reinvestment of all distributions.

- - Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $15.32, the Trust had a
  market yield of 6.08% at May 31, 2003.(3) The Trust's market yield is
  equivalent to a taxable yield of 9.62%.(4)

</Table>

(1) Trust Statistics, Rating Distribution and Five Largest Categories are
    subject to change. Rating Distribution is determined by dividing the total
    market value of the issues by the total investments of the Trust.

(2) A portion of the Trust's income may be subject to federal and state income
    tax and/or federal alternative minimum tax.

(3) The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
    per share by the share price at the end of the period and annualizing the
    result.

(4) Taxable-equivalent yield assumes maximum 36.82% combined federal and state
    income tax rate. A lower rate would result in a lower tax-equivalent figure.

(5) Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
    change in share price or net asset value with all distributions reinvested.

*   Private insurance does not remove the risk of loss of principal associated
    with insured investments due to changes in market conditions.

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and
    share price will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or
    less than their original cost.

 AMT - Interest earned from these securities may be considered a tax
 preference item for purposes of the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax.

 The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by California
 municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet
 their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific
 industry or municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such
 economic developments, at May 31, 2003, 60.3% of the securities in the
 portfolio of investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial
 institutions and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate
 percentage insured by financial institutions ranged from 6.4% to 21.9% of
 total investments.

 (1)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.
 (2)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
      of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.
 (3)  Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond.
 (4)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
      requirements on open financial futures contracts.

 The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by Florida
 municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet
 their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific
 industry or municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such
 economic developments, at May 31, 2003, 61.2% of the securities in the
 portfolio of investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial
 institutions and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate
 percentage insured by financial institutions ranged from 7.5% to 19.6% of
 total investments.
 (1)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.
 (2)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
      of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.
 (3)  Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond.
 (4)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
      requirements on open financial futures contracts.

 The Trust invests primarily in debt securities issued by Massachusetts
 municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet
 their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific
 industry or municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such
 economic developments, at May 31, 2003, 44.9% of the securities in the
 portfolio of investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial
 institutions and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate
 percentage insured by financial institutions ranged from 3.3% to 18.2% of
 total investments.
 (1)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.
 (2)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
      of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.
 (3)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
      requirements on open financial futures contracts.
 (4)  Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond.

 their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific

 portfolio of investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial
 institutions and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate
 percentage insured by financial institutions ranged from 6.3% to 23.5% of
 total investments.

      requirements on open financial futures contracts.
 (2)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
      of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

      Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
      method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of
      this change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net
      investment income per share by $0.012, decrease net realized and
      unrealized gains per share by $0.012, increase the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets applicable to common shares from

 (1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.
 (2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
      Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
      method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of
      this change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net
      investment income per share by $0.005, increase net realized and
      unrealized losses per share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets applicable to common shares from
      7.51% to 7.54% and increase the ratio of net investment income to
      average total net assets from 4.74% to 4.76%. Per share data and ratios
      for the periods prior to December 1, 2001 have not been restated to
      reflect this change in presentation.
 (3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
      30, 1999.
 (4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
      change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return
      is not computed on an annualized basis.
 (5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
      shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
      reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.
 (6)  Annualized.
 (7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including
      the preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this
      by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
 (8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

 (1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.
 (2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
      Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
      method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of
      this change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net
      investment income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and
      unrealized gains per share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets applicable to common shares from
      7.78% to 7.80% and increase the ratio of net investment income to
      average total net assets from 4.87% to 4.88%. Per share data and ratios
      for the periods prior to December 1, 2001 have not been restated to
      reflect this change in presentation.
 (3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
      30, 1999.
 (4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
      change in market value with all distibutions reinvested. Total return is
      not computed on an annualized basis.
 (5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
      shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
      reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.
 (6)  Annualized.
 (7)  Calculated by substracting the Trust's liabilities (not including the
      preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this by
      the number of preferred shares outstanding.
 (8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

 (1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.
 (2)  The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and
      Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using the interest
      method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of
      this change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to increase net
      investment income per share by $0.005, decrease net realized and
      unrealized gains per share by $0.005, increase the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets applicable to common shares from
      7.80% to 7.84% and increase the ratio of net investment income to
      average total net assets from 4.88% to 4.91%. Per share data and ratios
      for the periods prior to December 1, 2001 have not been restated to
      reflect this change in presentation.
 (3)  For the period from the start of business, January 29, 1999, to November
      30, 1999.
 (4)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
      change in market value with all distributions reinvested. Total return
      is not computed on an annualized basis.
 (5)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
      shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
      reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.
 (6)  Annualized.
 (7)  Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including
      the preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and dividing this
      by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
 (8)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

      method to amortize premiums of fixed-income securities. The effect of

      investment income per share by $0.003, decrease net realized and
      unrealized gains per share by $0.003, increase the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets applicable to common shares from

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AS OF MAY 31, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1 Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------------------
   Eaton Vance California Municipal Income Trust (California Trust), Eaton Vance
   Florida Municipal Income Trust (Florida Trust), Eaton Vance Massachusetts
   Municipal Income Trust (Massachusetts Trust), Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal
   Income Trust (Michigan Trust), Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income Trust
   (New Jersey Trust), Eaton Vance New York Municipal Income Trust (New York
   Trust), Eaton Vance Ohio Municipal Income Trust (Ohio Trust), and Eaton Vance
   Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (Pennsylvania Trust), (individually
   referred to as the Trust or collectively the Trusts) are registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end
   management investment companies. The Trusts were organized under the laws of
   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust
   dated December 10, 1998. Each Trust's investment objective is to achieve
   current income exempt from regular federal income taxes and taxes in its
   specified state. Each Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing
   primarily in investment grade municipal obligations issued by its specified
   state.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

 A Investment Valuation -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates fair value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods determined
   in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

 B Investment Transactions -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

 C Income -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

 D Federal Taxes -- Each Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At November 30,
   2002, the Trusts, for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss
   carryovers which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
   gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
   Code, and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders
   which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trusts of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital
   loss carryovers of each Trust are as follows:

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS AS OF MAY 31, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) CONT'D

   income generated by its investments in municipal obligations, which are
   exempt from regular federal income taxes when received by each Trust, as
   exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any, earned on
   private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986, may be considered a tax
   preference item for investors.

 E Financial Futures Contracts -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by a Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Trust. A Trust's investment
   in financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against
   anticipated future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should
   interest rates move unexpectedly, a Trust may not achieve the anticipated
   benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

 F Options on Financial Futures Contracts -- Upon the purchase of a put option
   on a financial futures contract by a Trust, the premium paid is recorded as
   an investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, a Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
   option. When a Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, a Trust will
   realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When a Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium
   originally paid.

 G Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 H Expense Reduction -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
   of the Trusts. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT receives
   a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balances each Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used
   to reduce the Trusts' custodian fees are reported as a reduction of total
   expenses in the Statement of Operations.

 I Interim Financial Statements -- The interim financial statements relating to
   May 31, 2003 and for the six months then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Trusts'
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2 Auction Preferred Shares (APS)
- -------------------------------------------
   Each Trust issued Auction Preferred Shares on March 1, 1999 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of capital of the common shares of each Trust. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Trust's APS and have been reset every seven days
   thereafter by an auction.

   Auction Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of May 31, 2003 and
   dividend rate ranges for the six months ended May 31, 2003 are as indicated
   below:

    New York                                               1,780       0.60% - 1.25%

</Table>

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Trust at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the Common Shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate

   class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of Trustees.
   The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus accumulated
   and unpaid dividends. Each Trust is required to maintain certain asset
   coverage with respect to the APS as defined in each Trust's By-Laws and the
   Investment Company Act of 1940. Each Trust pays an annual fee equivalent to
   0.25% of the preferred shares liquidation value for the remarketing efforts
   associated with the preferred auction.

3 Distributions to Shareholders
- -------------------------------------------
   Each Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the Auction
   Preferred Shares on May 31, 2003 was 0.795%, 1.10%, 1.00%, 0.90%, 1.05%,
   0.65%, 1.10%, and 1.125%, for California Trust, Florida Trust, Massachusetts
   Trust, Michigan Trust, New Jersey Trust, New York Trust, Ohio Trust and
   Pennsylvania Trust, respectively. For the six months ended May 31, 2003, the
   amount of dividends each Trust paid to Auction Preferred shareholders and
   average APS dividend rates for such period were as follows:

    New York                                          208,753                0.94%
    Ohio                                              113,181                0.98%

</Table>

   The Funds distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid-in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4 Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
- -------------------------------------------
   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.70% of each
   Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each
   Trust. Except for Trustees of each Trust who are not members of EVM's
   organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services
   to each Trust out of such investment adviser fee. For the six months ended
   May 31, 2003, the fee was equivalent to 0.70% of each Trust's average weekly
   gross assets and amounted to $583,160, $348,116, $212,451, $169,748,
   $364,331, $441,377, $225,121, and $215,444, for California Trust, Florida
   Trust, Massachusetts Trust, Michigan Trust, New Jersey Trust, New York Trust,
   Ohio Trust and Pennsylvania Trust, respectively. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of each Trust. An administration fee, computed at the annual
   rate of 0.20% of the average weekly gross assets of each Trust is paid to EVM
   for administering business affairs of each Trust. For the six months ended
   May 31, 2003, the administrative fee amounted to $166,617, $99,462, $60,700,
   $48,499, $104,095, $126,108, $64,320, and $61,556, for California Trust,
   Florida Trust, Massachusetts Trust, Michigan Trust, New Jersey Trust, New
   York Trust, Ohio Trust and Pennsylvania Trust, respectively.

   Trustees of the Trusts that are not affiliated with the Investment Adviser
   may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in
   accordance with the terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For the
   six months ended May 31, 2003, no significant amounts have been deferred.

   Certain officers and one Trustee of each Trust are officers of the above
   organization.

5 Investments

8 Financial Instruments
- -------------------------------------------
   Each Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment a Trust has
   in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUSTS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc., at
1-800-331-1710.

APPLICATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

This form is for shareholders who hold their common shares in their own names.
If your common shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other
nominee, you should contact your nominee to see if it will participate in the
Plan on your behalf. If you wish to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage
firm, bank, or nominee is unable to participate on your behalf, you should
request that your common shares be re-registered in your own name which will
enable your participation in the Plan.

The following authorization and appointment is given with the understanding that
I may terminate it at any time by terminating my participation in the Plan as
provided in the terms and conditions of the Plan.

I, Thomas J. Fetter; certify that:

1. I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Eaton Vance Pennsylvania
Municipal Income Fund;

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash
flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement of cash
flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4. The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and
have:

a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared;

b) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report
(the "Evaluation Date"); and

c) presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of the Evaluation
Date;

<Page>

5. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our
most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
functions):

a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of the internal
controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal controls; and

6. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to
the date of our most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with
regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
