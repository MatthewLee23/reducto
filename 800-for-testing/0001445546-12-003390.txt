                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are
spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information, this
report and other Fund regulatory filings.

you will find the Fund's financial statements for the period this report covers.
I encourage you to read this document and discuss it with your financial

this approach in the products we manage or supervise and offer to investors.

As you know, First Trust offers a variety of products that we believe could fit
many financial plans to help investors seeking long-term investment success. We
encourage you to talk to your financial advisor about the other investments
First Trust offers that might also fit your financial goals and to discuss those
goals with your financial advisor regularly so that he or she can help keep you
on track.

First Trust will continue to make available up-to-date information about your
investments so you and your financial advisor are current on any First Trust
investments you own. We value our relationship with you, and thank you for the

                                   COMMENTARY

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior loans. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may
not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

Despite a challenging macro environment, senior loans managed to post positive
returns for the full-year period ended May 31, 2012. The period began and ended
on a similar note- a focus on European sovereign debt issues and concerns
regarding the strength of the U.S. economy, which resulted in increased market
volatility. The senior loan market began the period with negative returns in two
out of the first three months and ended the period with a negative return in May
2012. While the uncertainty in the market held back senior loan returns early
and late in the period, the market provided fairly steady positive returns in
between. Overall, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index returned 2.35% for the
full-year period. Higher credit quality issues in the index performed much
better than lower credit quality issues during the period. BB rated loans
returned 3.79% and B rated loans returned 3.15%, both of which were
significantly better than the lower quality CCC rated loan return of -8.77% for
the period.

Fundamental credit quality remained strong over the period with default rates
trending below the historic average. The default rate began the period at 0.91%
and ended the year at 1.05%, well inside the historic average of 3.46%.1

Technical conditions in the senior loan market were generally balanced to
slightly positive over the period with positive inflows into the asset class
from retail senior loan funds and structured products (CLOs) in 9 of the 12
months.2 While credit quality remained strong and inflows were generally
positive into the asset class, average loan prices declined from $95.4 at the
beginning of the period to $93.5 at the end of May 2012.3 The income component
was able to more than fully offset this decline in average loan prices, which
allowed the asset class to post a positive return for the period.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2012


PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund outperformed the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index for the one-year period
ended May 31, 2012. The Fund generated an NAV return of 4.45% and a market price
return of 2.95%. The Fund's market price return was hindered by the Fund's
market price beginning at a slight premium to NAV and moving to a slight
discount to NAV by the end of the period. At the start of the period, the Fund's
market price was at a 0.41% premium to NAV, which moved to a modest -1.04%
discount to NAV by the end of the period.

From an income perspective, the Fund announced four increases to the monthly
distribution for a total increase of $0.01 per share over the year ended May 31,
2012. The monthly announced distribution began the period at $0.07 per share and
ended at $0.08 per share. This increase represented an improvement of
approximately 14% in the level of monthly distributions to shareholders over
this period. At the $0.08 per share monthly distribution level, the distribution
rate at the end of May was 6.63% at NAV and 6.69% at market price.

Contributing to the Fund's outperformance relative to the S&P/LSTA Leveraged
Loan Index over the period was the Fund's higher average credit quality and the
use of leverage. (While the S&P/LSTA Leverged Loan Index consists of leveraged
loans, the index itself is not leveraged.) The Fund's relatively conservative
credit quality positioning benefited performance as CCC+ and lower-rated issuers
lagged the market return. At the end of the period, the Fund held only 2% of
assets in issues rated CCC+ or below compared to 8.8% for the S&P/LSTA Leveraged
Loan Index. Leverage at the end of May was approximately 30.1%.

OUTLOOK

While we have witnessed an increase in volatility across many asset classes
recently, and expect this may continue for a period of time while European
sovereign debt concerns dominate the headlines, we remain optimistic regarding
the outlook for the senior loan asset class. The combination of relatively
attractive current income within a market plagued by negative real yields, along
with a senior secured position in the capital structure in a low corporate
default rate environment, should continue to support performance. Moreover, we
believe fundamental credit health remains strong, which should allow the asset
class to continue to experience a below average default rate in the near term.

We expect our rigorous credit process and focus on identifying attractive
risk-adjusted return opportunities in the market will continue to position the
portfolio well for the periods ahead. The Fund's portfolio strategy of balancing
the goal of high current income with portfolio risk remains unchanged. We do not
anticipate changing the average credit quality of the portfolio in a meaningful
way over the near term. As such, the portfolio should remain of higher average
credit quality than the index. In the upcoming periods, we expect the new issue
market to provide some compelling opportunities which may enhance the portfolio
characteristics. The combination of attractive new issuance and our focus on
relative value opportunities across the market should continue to position the
portfolio well for the periods ahead.

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- by Standard
      & Poor's Ratings Group are considered to be below investment grade.

(c)   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests pay interest at rates which are
      periodically predetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
      premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
      offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
      Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more United
      States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior
      Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate.
      The interest rate shown reflects the rate in effect at May 31, 2012.

(d)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(e)   This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The rating
      agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the rating.

(f)   Delayed Draw Loan (see Note 2C - Unfunded Loan Commitments in the Notes to
      Financial Statements).

(g)   Represents commitment fee rate on unfunded loan commitment.

(h)   This security is fair valued in accordance with procedures adopted by the
      Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(i)   This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(j)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 1D - Restricted Securities in the Notes
      to Financial Statements).

(k)   This Senior Loan is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
      whereby 1.00% of interest per annum is to be paid in cash and 13.75% of
      interest per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely
      in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) a combination
      thereof. Interest is to be paid semi-annually; however, the issuer is in
      default and income is not being accrued.

(l)   Non-income producing security.

(m)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $552,975,900. As of May
      31, 2012, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all investments
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,231,412 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all investments in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $13,163,555.

*     See the Portfolio of Investments for the industry breakout. Industry
      categories are only shown separately if they include holdings in two or
      more levels or have holdings in only Level 3.

**    Market value is less than $1.

All transfers in and out of Level 3 during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. As of May 31,
2012, the Fund transferred Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests valued at
$11,342,281 from Level 3 to Level 2 and $965,139 from Level 2 to Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. The Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests that transferred
between Level 3 and Level 2 did so primarily as a result of additional
information obtained from an independent third party pricing vendor relating to
the market activity of individual Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests.

The following table presents the Fund's investments measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the period

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2012


                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans")1. There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily in accordance with valuation procedures
adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with provisions of
the 1940 Act. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and
sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the fair value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. The third party
pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from dealer runs and
broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior Loans.

Common stocks and other securities listed on any national or foreign exchange
(excluding the NASDAQ National Market ("NASDAQ") and the London Stock Exchange
Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") are valued at the last sale price on the
exchange on which they are principally traded. If there are no transactions on
the valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent
bid and asked prices. Securities listed on the NASDAQ or the AIM are valued at
the official closing price. If there is no official closing price on the
valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent bid
and asked prices. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at
their closing bid prices.

Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when purchased
are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.

In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation, or the valuations received are deemed
unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities.
Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal markets for
certain securities (e.g., domestic debt securities and foreign securities) that
could materially affect the Fund's NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method
to value the Fund's securities. The use of fair value pricing is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act. As a general principle, the fair value of a
security is the amount which the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the
security upon its current sale. However, in light of the judgment involved in
fair valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair value assigned to a
particular security will be the amount which the Fund might be able to receive
upon its current sale. Fair valuation of a security is based on the
consideration of all available information, including, but not limited to, the
following:

1)    the fundamental business data relating to the issuer;

2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which these
      securities are purchased and sold;

3)    the type, size and cost of the security;



1     The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.

                                                                         Page 21

                        FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                          MAY 31, 2012

4)    the financial statements of the issuer;

5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the issuer, based on the Advisor's or
      external analysis;

6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the security;

7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or equity
      securities) of the issuer/borrower, or comparable companies;

8)    the coupon payments;

9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing the
      security;

10)   the business prospects of the issuer, including any ability to obtain
      money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an assessment of the
      issuer's management;

11)   the prospects for the issuer's industry, and multiples (of earnings and/or
      cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in that industry;

12)   issuer's competitive position within the industry;

13)   issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through public and/or
      private markets; and

14)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - -Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - -Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - -Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing portfolio investments are not
necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those
investments. A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's portfolio
investments as of May 31, 2012 is included with the Fund's Portfolio of
Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective security.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
didn't have any when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments as
of May 31, 2012.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
$1,633,222 as of May 31, 2012.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
May 31, 2012, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. These securities are valued according to the valuation procedures as
stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a
discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There
are no unrestricted investments with the same maturity dates and yields for
these issuers.

(1)   Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July
      31, 2007.

E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or NAV per share. Temporary differences, which
arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and gain/loss in
different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will reverse at some
time in the future. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31,
2012, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have been reclassified
at year end to reflect a decrease in accumulated net investment income (loss) of
$18,771, an increase in accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments of
$43,008 and a decrease to paid-in capital of $24,237. Net assets were not
affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2012 and 2011 is as follows:

                Distributions paid from:            2012              2011
                                               -------------      -------------
                Ordinary income.............   $  21,979,654      $  17,618,839

As of May 31, 2012, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

                Undistributed ordinary income...................  $   2,161,651
                Undistributed capital gains.....................             --
                                                                  -------------

                                                                  -------------
                Net assets......................................  $ 367,171,763
                                                                  =============


F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98.2% of the Fund's taxable income
exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses recognized after December 31, 2010, may be carried forward
indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term and/or long-term
losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for up to eight
years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition rule, the Act requires
that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment net capital
losses. At May 31, 2012, the Fund had pre-enactment net capital losses for
federal income tax purposes of $105,285,525 expiring as follows:

                                                                         Page 23

         EXPIRATION DATE             AMOUNT
         May 31, 2014         $   3,143,970

         May 31, 2017         $  25,585,953
         May 31, 2018         $  68,278,827
         May 31, 2019         $   4,665,052

During the taxable year ended May 31, 2012, the Fund utilized pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $840,490.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending 2009, 2010,
2011 and 2012 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2012,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

H. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU
2011-04 "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs", modifying Topic 820, "Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures." At the same time, the International Accounting
Standards Board ("IASB") issued International Financial Reporting Standard
("IFRS") 13, "Fair Value Measurement." The objective of the FASB and IASB is
convergence of their guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures.
Specifically, the ASU requires reporting entities to disclose (i) the amounts of
any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, and the reasons for the transfers,
(ii) for Level 3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about
significant unobservable inputs used, (iii) a description of the valuation
processes used by the reporting entity, and (iv) a narrative description of the
sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a
change in those inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair
value measurement. The effective date of the ASU is for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and it is therefore not effective for
the current fiscal year. Management is in the process of assessing the impact of
the updated standards on the Fund's financial statements, if any.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of
the Fund's investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and
providing certain administrative services necessary for the management of the
Fund. For these investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a
monthly fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets
(the average daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's
liabilities other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also
provides fund reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount
of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund's Administrator,
Fund Accountant and Transfer Agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements.
Effective September 30, 2011, the Bank of New York Mellon serves as the Fund's
Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements. Prior to September 30,
2011, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company (formerly known as PFPC
Trust Company) served as the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee
arrangements.

Effective January 23, 2012, James A. Bowen resigned from his position as the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Fund. He continues as a Trustee,
the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a member of the Executive Committee.
The Board elected Mark R. Bradley to serve as the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Fund and James M. Dykas to serve as the Treasurer, Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of the Fund.

Effective January 1, 2012, each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of
First Trust, any sub-advisor or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees")
is paid a fixed annual retainer of $125,000 per year and an annual per fund fee
of $4,000 for each closed-end fund or other actively managed fund and $1,000 for
each index fund in the First Trust Fund Complex. The fixed annual retainer is
allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net
assets. Prior to January 1, 2012, each Independent Trustee received an annual
retainer of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund
Complex and an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each additional trust in
the First Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer was allocated equally among
each of the trusts.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $15,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $10,000 annually, and each of the
Chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Valuation Committee
is paid $5,000 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation
allocated pro rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net
assets. Prior to January 1, 2012, the annual amounts paid were $10,000, $5,000
and $2,500, respectively. Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket

expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and each
Committee chairman will serve two-year terms before rotating to serve as
chairman of another committee or as Lead Independent Trustee. The officers and
"Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from the funds for acting in such
capacities.

                     4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2012 were $340,571,019 and $364,476,165,
respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility had an expiration date of May 9,
2012, which was extended until July 13, 2012. The Credit Facility provides for a
secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against
advances made to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund,
immediately after any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least
300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment
under the Credit Facility is $170,000,000. For the year ended May 31, 2012, the
average amount outstanding was $156,636,612. The loans under the Credit Facility
funded by CRC Funding, LLC (the "Conduit Lender") bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
Conduit Lender. The loans under the Credit Facility funded by Citibank, N.A.
(the "Secondary Lender") bear interest for each settlement period at a per annum
rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the settlement period plus 0.60% or
(ii) the alternate base rate plus 0.60%. For the year ended May 31, 2012, the
Fund had no loans under the Credit Facility funded by the Secondary Lender. The
high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the Credit Facility
funded by the Conduit Lender during the year ended May 31, 2012, were 0.32% and
0.13%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.23%. The annual
interest rate in effect for such loans at May 31, 2012 was 0.31%. The Fund also
pays additional borrowing costs, which includes a program fee of 0.30% of the
amount outstanding and a liquidity fee of 0.30% of the total commitment under
the Credit Facility per year.

                   6. CHANGE IN CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

On December 12, 2011, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved changes to certain
of the Fund's investment strategies. The Fund's investment strategies are
non-fundamental policies of the Fund and require 60 days' prior written notice
to shareholders before they can be changed by the Board without receiving
shareholder approval. As such, effective on or about April 9, 2012, the
following Fund investment strategy became effective:

The Fund has been approved to purchase publicly-traded high-yield bonds for a
portion of its portfolio. These purchases will be limited to no more than 10% of
managed assets and they are in addition to purchases of revolving credit
facilities, investment grade debtor-in-possession financing, unsecured loans,
other floating rate debt securities (such as notes, bonds and asset-backed
securities, which include special purchase trusts investing in bank loans),
investment grade loans, fixed income debt obligations, and money market
instruments (such as commercial paper).

                             7. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor determines that it is temporarily
unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is impractical to do
so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and trading in the
investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take temporary
defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

                                                                         Page 25

                FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2012


LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

                               8. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On June 20, 2012, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.08125 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 5, 2012, payable July 16, 2012.

On July 19, 2012, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.08375 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on August 3, 2012, payable August 15, 2012.

The Fund entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement on July 13,
2012, with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova
Scotia as secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the
agreement. This agreement and the related documentation replace the Credit
Facility with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, which
terminated on July 13, 2012.

The new credit facility has an expiration date of July 12, 2013, and may be
renewed annually. The new credit facility provides for a secured line of credit
for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund.
Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such
borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's
total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the new credit
facility is $175,000,000. The loans under the new credit facility funded
generally bear interest for each settlement period at a rate per annum based on
the commercial paper rate of the conduit lender. The Fund also pays additional
borrowing costs, which include a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.40% of
the daily average of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances
during the prior calendar month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the
product of (i) 0.40% of the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or
if terminated, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded
or maintained) during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2012 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian and agent banks; where replies were not received, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2012, the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

      (a)   The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
            has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
            principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
            accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
            functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by
            the registrant or a third party.

      (c)   There have been no amendments, during the period covered by this
            report, to a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the

            officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
            performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
            individuals are employed by the registrant or a third party, and
            that relates to any element of the code of ethics description.

      (d)   The registrant has not granted any waivers, including an implicit
            waiver, from a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the
            registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial
            officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
            performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
            individuals are employed by the registrant or a third party, that
            relates to one or more of the items set forth in paragraph (b) of
            this item's instructions.

      (e)   Not applicable.


ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

As of the end of the period covered by the report, the registrant's Board of
Trustees has determined that Thomas R. Kadlec and Robert F. Keith are qualified
to serve as audit committee financial experts serving on its audit committee and
that each of them is "independent," as defined by Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

      (a) AUDIT FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed for each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
accountant for the audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or
services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $55,000 for 2011 and
$67,000 for 2012.

      (b) AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years, for assurance and related services by the
principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under paragraph
(a) of this Item were $0 for 2011 and $0 for 2012.

         AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and related
services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the
performance of the audit of the Registrant's financial statements and are not
reported under paragraph (a) of this Item were $0 for 2011 and $0 for 2012.

      (c) TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant
for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the registrant were $0 for
2011 and $10,400 for 2012. These fees were for tax consultation and tax
preparation.

          TAX FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of

the registrant's adviser were $0 for 2011 and $0 for 2012.

      (d) ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of
the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2011 and $0 for 2012.

         ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the
principal accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than services
reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2011 and $0 for
2012.

      (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
             described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.

      (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
             through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
             adviser of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
             pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph
             (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
             are as follows:

                          (b)  0%

                          (c)  0%

                          (d)  0%

      (f)   The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
            engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the
            most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
            persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent
            employees was less than fifty percent.

      (g)   The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
            for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the
            registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
            provides ongoing services to the Registrant for 2011 were $15.18 and
            $0 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser,
            respectively, and for 2012 were $10,400 and $10,320 for the
            Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser, respectively.

      (h)   The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
            that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not
            pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
            Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
            accountant's independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

      (a)   The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
            consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The
            members of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B.
            Nielson, Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a)   Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
      close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
      shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)   Not applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.


                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P.
                            PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Adviser") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for separate managed
accounts, ERISA accounts and open- and closed-end investment companies (the
"Clients"). As part of these services, the Adviser may have responsibility for
proxy voting and related duties. In fulfilling these duties, the Adviser has
adopted the following policies and procedures:

         1. It is the Adviser's policy to seek and to ensure that proxies are
voted on securities in a Client's account consistently and solely in the best
economic interests of the Client.

         2. The Adviser shall be responsible for the oversight of Client proxy
voting processes and shall assign a senior member of its staff to be responsible
for this oversight.

         3. The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the voting of
proxies related to securities held by Clients. ISS provides voting
recommendations based on established guidelines and practices. The Adviser has
adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.

         4. The Adviser shall review the ISS recommendations and generally will
vote proxies in accordance with such recommendations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance with the ISS recommendations
if the Adviser believes that the specific ISS recommendation is not in the best
interests of the Client. In addition, whenever a conflict of interest arises
between ISS and a company subject to a proxy vote, the Adviser will vote the
proxy without using the analyses of ISS and will consider the recommendation of
the company and what the Adviser believes to be in the best interests of the
Client. In addition, if the Adviser has actual knowledge of any other type of
material conflict of interest between itself and the respective Client with
respect to the voting of a proxy, the Adviser shall vote the applicable proxy in
accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest. With
respect to open- and closed-end funds and variable annuity sub-accounts, if
there is a conflict of interest between fund shareholders and FTA, the fund's
principal underwriter, or sub-adviser, if applicable, FTA will vote the proxy
based on the recommendations of ISS to avoid such conflict of interest.

         5. If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
any of the Adviser's Clients hold any securities in that company, the Adviser
will vote proxies relating to such company's securities in accordance with the
ISS recommendations to avoid any conflict of interest.

         6. If a Client requests the Adviser to follow specific voting
guidelines or additional guidelines, the Adviser shall review the request and
follow such guidelines, unless the Adviser determines that it is unable to
follow such guidelines. In such case, the Adviser shall inform the Client that
it is not able to follow the Client's request.

         7. FTA will monitor changes to the ISS guidelines to determine that
such guidelines continue to result in a voting policy that is in the best
interests of Clients.

         8. In certain circumstances, where FTA has determined that it is
consistent with the Client's best interest, FTA will not take steps to ensure
that proxies are voted on securities in the Client's accounts. The following are
circumstances where this may occur:

         (a) Limited Value. Proxies will not be required to be voted on
securities in a Client's account if the value of the Client's economic interest
in the securities is indeterminable or insignificant (less than $1,000). Proxies
will also not be required to be voted for any securities that are no longer held
by the Client's account.

         (b) Securities Lending Program. When securities are out on loan, they
are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in its
discretion. In most cases, FTA will not take steps to see that loaned securities
are voted. However, where FTA determines that a proxy vote, or other shareholder
action, is materially important to the Client's account, FTA will make a good
faith effort to recall the security for purposes of voting, understanding that
in certain cases, the attempt to recall the security may not be effective in
time for voting deadlines to be met.

         (c) Unjustifiable Costs. In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, FTA may choose not to vote where the cost of voting a
Client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits to the Client of the proxy
proposal (e.g. foreign securities).

         9. For certain open- or closed-end funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(F)
of the 1940 Act, FTA will vote on proxies of securities of investment companies
held by such funds in the same proportion as all other holders of such
securities (i.e. mirror or echo voting) to the extent possible.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. The First Trust Leveraged Finance Investment
Team adheres to its trade allocation policy utilizing a pro-rata methodology to
address this conflict.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations.

In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the Code of Ethics
and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the Leveraged Finance
Investment Team currently are prohibited from buying or selling equity
securities (including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and
futures) and corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over
which they exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Investment Team
are also prohibited from engaging in any personal transaction while in
possession of material non-public information regarding the security or the
issuer of the security. First Trust and FTP also maintain a confidential watch
list of all issuers for which the Leveraged Finance Investment Team has material
non-public information in its possession.

(a)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF MAY 31, 2012

The compensation structure for the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust is based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined
by the management of First Trust.

Salaries are determined by management and are based upon an individual's
position and overall value to the firm. Bonuses are also determined by
management and are based upon an individual's overall contribution to the
success of the firm and the profitability of the firm. Salaries and bonuses for
members of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team are not based upon criteria
such as performance of the Registrant or the value of assets of the Fund,
although discretionary bonuses for Leveraged Finance Team members are based on
the profitability of the leveraged finance department.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.

<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

4.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for

      (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the

          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

      (b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

          accounting principles;

      (c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
