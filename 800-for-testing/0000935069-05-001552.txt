             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital, of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") at March 31, 2005, and the
results of its operations, the changes in its members' capital, its cash flows
and the financial highlights for the period August 1, 2004 (commencement of
operations) through March 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included confirmation
of investments at March 31, 2005 with the investment funds, provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability  company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware  and
is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  as a
closed-end,   non-diversified,   management   investment  company.   The  Fund's
investment  objective is to generate  consistent  capital  appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets  primarily  among  professionally  selected  investment
funds  ("Investment   Funds")  that  are  managed  by  experienced   third-party
investment  advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ("J.P. Morgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation
of assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board
of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited  liability
company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),
serves as the managing  member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as
a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The Special  Member is  entitled  to all  performance-based
incentive allocations, if any from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager as of the last business day of each month in accordance with
the valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to
time pursuant to policies established by the Board.

The Fund's investments in the Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and
can only be redeemed periodically. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to
which the Fund values its  investments  in  Investment  Funds at fair value.  In
accordance with these procedures,  fair value as of each month-end ordinarily is
the value determined as of such month-end for each Investment Fund in accordance
with the Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies and reported at the time of the
Fund's valuation.

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that the Fund could  reasonably  expect to receive from an
Investment  Fund  if the  Fund's  interest  were  redeemed  at the  time  of the
valuation,  based on information  reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would  determine  the fair value of such  Investment  Fund based on the
most recent value  reported by the  Investment  Fund, as well any other relevant
information  available  at the time the Fund  values its  portfolio.  The values
assigned to these  investments  are based on  available  information  and do not
necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such amounts
depend on future  circumstances  and cannot  reasonably be determined  until the
individual investments are actually liquidated. However, because of the inherent
uncertainty of valuation,  those estimated values may differ  significantly from
the  values  that would  have been used had a ready  market for the  investments
existed, and the differences could be significant.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a

reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund as a
return  of  capital.  Once  the  investment's  cost  is  received,  any  further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund.

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance;  registration expenses; due diligence,  including travel and
related expenses;  expenses of meetings of the Board and Members; all costs with
respect to  communications  to  Members;  and other  types of expenses as may be
approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the  payment of
Federal,  state  or local  income  taxes  has  been  provided.  Each  Member  is
individually  required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

H. INITIAL OFFERING COSTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

These costs are being amortized over a twelve-month period from the commencement
of operations.

Costs incurred in connection with the  organization of the Fund were expensed at
the commencement of operations.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized  basis) and an additional
administrative  services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis)
of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed 2.30%  (comprising  the 1.5%  Management  Fee,  the 0.15%  Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee  and not  more  than a  further  0.65%  for  other
operating  expenses) on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense limitations.  Total
expenses  of the Fund  assumed by the  Investment  Manager  for the period  from
August 1, 2004 through March 31, 2005 were $60,418.  The Investment Manager also
waived fees of $275,000 during the same period.

The Fund has entered into an administration  agreement with PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC"),
whereby PFPC provides fund  accounting,  investor  services and transfer  agency
functions for the Fund. As  compensation  for services set forth herein that are
rendered by PFPC during the term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PFPC an annual
fee  ranging  from 0.035% to 0.075% of the Fund's  average  net  assets,  with a
minimum monthly fee of $6,250 for administration  and accounting,  an annual fee
of 0.015% of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum

monthly fee of $3,334 for regulatory  administration services, and an annual fee
for Member  services of $150 per Member,  with a minimum  monthly fee of $1,000.
PFPC waived $13,252 of its fees for the period from August 1, 2004 through March
31, 2005. Any fees waived by PFPC are recoverable from the Fund if the agreement
with PFPC is terminated  within the first three years of the  effective  date of
the agreement.

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

PFPC  Trust  Company  serves as  custodian  of the Fund's  assets  and  provides
custodial services to the Fund.

4. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the period ended March 31,
2005 amounted to $81,981,000 and $1,469,722, respectively.

At March 31, 2005,  the estimated  cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax
purposes  was  substantially  the  same  as the  cost  for  financial  reporting
purposes.   Accordingly,   gross  unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  was
$4,989,417  and gross  unrealized  depreciation  on  investments  was  $310,934,
resulting in net unrealized appreciation on investments of $4,678,483.

5. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date, the Fund intends to
accept subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets

5. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

quarterly, effective as of the last day of March, June, September, and December.
A 1.5%  repurchase  fee payable to the Fund will be charged for  repurchases  of
Members'  Interests  at any time  prior  to the day  immediately  preceding  the
one-year  anniversary of a Member's  purchase of its  Interests.  For the period
ended March 31, 2005, the Fund charged Members' $7,849 in repurchase fees.

At the end of each Allocation  Period of the Fund, any net capital  appreciation
or net capital  depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized),  as the
case  may  be,  is  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all of the  Members
(including  the Special  Member and the Managing  Member) in proportion to their
respective  opening capital account  balances for such  Allocation  Period.  The
initial  "Allocation  Period"  began on the  Initial  Closing  Date,  with  each
subsequent  Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the  last  day of each  month,  (2) the  date  immediately  prior  to the
effective  date of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an  increase  in a
Member's  capital  contribution,  (3) the  effective  date of any  repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year, a Member's  return on its  investment for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital  account  during the year,  net of such Member's pro rata
share of the  Management  Fee,  is  reallocated  to the  capital  account of the
Special Member in the following manner: (1) net capital  appreciation up to a 6%
return  remains  allocated  to such Member  (the  "Preferred  Return");  (2) net
capital  appreciation  in excess of the Preferred  Return is  reallocated to the
Special  Member  until  it has been  allocated  the next  0.30% of  return  (the
"Catch-Up");  and (3) thereafter,  95% of any net capital appreciation in excess
of the Preferred Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member,  and
the remaining 5% of such net capital  appreciation is reallocated to the Special
Member.  The amounts  reallocated  to the Special Member under (2) and (3) above
are referred to as the "Incentive Allocation."

No Incentive  Allocation is made,  however,  with respect to a Member's  capital
account until any cumulative net capital  depreciation  previously  allocated to
such   Member's   capital   account  plus  any   Management   Fees  and  Manager
Administrative   Service  Fees  charged  to  such  capital  account  (the  "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately  to reflect  the  repurchase  of any  portion  of that  Member's
Interest.  At December 31, 2004, $118,391 was reallocated to the capital account
of the Special Member. Based upon profits for the year ended March 31, 2005, the
additional  Incentive Allocation that would be reallocated to the Special Member

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2005

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these
investments reported by the Fund.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment  Funds invest in actively  traded  securities and other
financial  instruments  using  different  strategies and investment  techniques,
including  leverage,  that may  involve  significant  risks.  Although  the Fund
attempts to  diversify  its risk by  investing in  Investment  Funds  managed by
different   third  party   managers,   the  Investment   Funds  may  nonetheless
independently  invest a high  percentage  of their assets in the same or similar
specific  sectors  of the  market  in order to  achieve  a  potentially  greater
investment  return. As a result, the Investment Funds may be more susceptible to
economic,  political,  and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the
market,  positive and negative,  and may experience  increased volatility of the
Investment  Funds' net asset  value.  The Fund  invests  in a limited  number of
Investment Funds. Such concentration may result in additional risk.

Because of the  limitation on rights of redemption  and the fact that the Fund's
limited  liability  company  interests  will  not be  traded  on any  securities
exchange  or other  market and will be subject to  substantial  restrictions  on
transfer,  and because of the fact that the Fund may invest in Investment  Funds
that do not  permit  frequent  withdrawals  and  that  may  invest  in  illiquid
securities,  an  investment  in the Fund is a  highly  illiquid  investment  and
involves a substantial degree of risk.  Illiquid  securities owned by Investment
Funds are riskier than liquid securities because the Investment Funds may not be
able to dispose  of the  illiquid  securities  if their  investment  performance
deteriorates,  or may be able to dispose of the  illiquid  securities  only at a
greatly reduced price.  Similarly,  the illiquidity of the Investment  Funds may
cause  investors  to incur  losses  because of an  inability  to withdraw  their
investments from the Fund during or following  periods of negative  performance.
Although the Investment Manager and the Managing Member intend to recommend that
quarterly offers be made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there
can be no assurance that the Fund will make such offers.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Through  May  1,  2005,  the  Fund  received  subscriptions  from  investors  of
$6,900,000 of which $4,237,500 was received in advance of March 31, 2005.

         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.



                 J.P. MORGAN ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

OBJECTIVE

J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. ("JPMAAM"), an investment adviser
registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission and an affiliate of J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co  ("JPMC"),  is  responsible  for the  allocation  of assets on
behalf of its clients to various private investment funds, including hedge funds
and other  alternative  investment  pools that are structured as private limited
partnerships,    limited   liability   companies   or   offshore    corporations
(collectively,  "Alternative  Investments").  The voting  rights of  Alternative
Investments  generally  are  contract  rights  set  forth in the  organizational
documents (e.g., the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company or
memorandum  and  articles  of  association).  As  privately  placed  securities,
Alternative  Investments  generally  are not  subject to the  regulatory  scheme
applicable  to  public  companies.  Consequently,  in  most  cases,  Alternative
Investments  do not issue  proxies.  Instead,  they often solicit  consents from
their limited partners, members or shareholders.

As an investment  manager,  JPMAAM in the normal course of business is typically
granted by its clients the  authority to vote the  solicitations  or consents of
Alternative  Investments and the proxies of securities  directly held by clients
that are not under the management of a sub-adviser  (e.g.,  securities  that are
received from in-kind  redemptions).  In accordance with the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers  Act"),  the Employee  Retirement  Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),  and other applicable  fiduciary and
regulatory standards, JPMAAM's objective is to vote the solicitations,  consents
and proxies (hereinafter  referred to as "proxies") in the best interests of its
clients.  To further  that  objective,  JPMAAM has adopted  these  Proxy  Voting
Policies and Procedures.

THE PROXY VOTING PROCESS

1. VOTING IN GENERAL. JPMAAM's Portfolio Management Group ("PMG") as part of its
ongoing analysis of client holdings monitors significant  developments  relating
to  the  portfolio  of  Alternative  Investments.  BECAUSE  IN  THE  CONTEXT  OF
ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS  EACH SOLICITED VOTE RAISES UNIQUE  QUESTIONS AND IS AN
INTEGRAL PART OF JPMAAM'S INVESTMENT  PROCESS,  EACH PROXY OR OTHER SOLICITATION
WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS WILL BE ANALYZED BY A MEMBER OR MEMBERS
OF THE PMG ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

For proxies  received  with  respect to any  securities  other than  Alternative
Investments  held  directly by  JPMAAM's  clients,  for which  JPMAAM has voting
responsibility, JPMAAM will defer the vote to a proxy voting service and vote in
accordance with their recommendation.

Situations  may  arise  in  which  more  than  one  client  invests  in the same
Alternative Investment or securities.  In addition, two or more fund/clients may
be invested in strategies  having different  investment  objectives,  investment
styles or portfolio  managers.  As a result,  JPMAAM may cast different votes on
behalf of different clients.

2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR VOTE FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS - PRIMARY CONTACT FOR THE
MANAGER OF THE  UNDERLYING  HEDGE FUND OR OTHER PERSON  IDENTIFIED BY COMPLIANCE
OFFICER.  Where  the  proxy  being  voted is with  respect  to  interests  in an
underlying  hedge fund  ("UHF")  owned by a JPMAAM  client over which JPMAAM has
discretionary  investment  authority,  it  shall  be the  responsibility  of the
Primary  Contact  in the PMG for the  investment  manager of the UHF to vote the
proxies in a timely manner and otherwise in accordance with these procedures. In
the absence of the Primary  Contact,  the  Compliance  Officer shall assign such
responsibility  to another  person in the PMG in accordance  with the procedures
set forth below in this section.

3. PROCEDURES FOR VOTING PROXIES. JPMAAM has adopted the following procedures in
order to ensure that all proxy materials are processed in a timely fashion:
<PAGE>

     o    All proxies and related  materials should be received by, or forwarded
          to, the  Operations  Group (the "OG") and processed by the  designated
          person or persons within the OG.

     o    The OG will:

          o    Forward the materials by e-mail to:

               []   the Primary Contact for the manager of that UHF in the PMG;
               []   the Secondary Contact for that manager in the PMG; and
               []   the Compliance Officer.

          o    Include in the cover email the following information:

               []   name of UHF and manager;
               []   name(s) of the JPMAAM client portfolio(s)  holding interests
                    in this UHF; and
               []   the date and time by which JPMAAM must submit the proxy (the
                    "Voting  Deadline").  (This is to allow  enough time for the
                    completed  proxy to be returned  to the issuer  prior to the
                    Voting Deadline.)

          o    The  Compliance  Officer  will  promptly  follow up via e-mail to
               ensure that if both the Primary Contact and Secondary Contact are
               unavailable,  the proxy material is assigned to another member of
               the PMG. The person assigned  responsibility (whether the Primary
               Contact, Secondary Contact, or another PMG member) is referred to
               herein  as the "PMG  Designate".  If the  Compliance  Officer  is
               absent, the Legal Department will perform this follow up.

          o    The  PMG  Designate  will  advise  each  PMG  member  who  is the
               portfolio manager of a client portfolio holding interests in that
               UHF of  the  proxy  solicitation,  and  will  analyze  the  proxy
               materials  and  make  a  decision  on  how to  vote  each  proxy,
               conferring  with the relevant  portfolio  managers if appropriate
               (absent  material  conflicts  of interest - if there are material
               conflicts  of  interest,  follow  procedures  described  below in
               "Material  Conflicts  of  Interest").  The  PMG  Designate  shall
               promptly  communicate  via  email or  otherwise  in  writing  the
               decision  as to how to vote  each  proxy  to the OG (by  close of
               business on the day before the Voting Deadline,  unless otherwise
               agreed with the OG), copying the Compliance  Officer for purposes
               of  recordkeeping.  Once  instructions  are  received in a timely
               manner from the PMG Designate,  the OG shall have  responsibility
               for  submitting  the  proxy  prior to the  Voting  Deadline  (and
               providing  a copy  of the  proxy,  as  voted,  to the  Compliance
               Officer).

          o    In some cases,  proxy  materials  stipulate how a failure to vote
               the proxy will be interpreted  (for example,  proxy materials may
               stipulate  that  no  vote  will be  deemed  to be a vote  for the
               proposal,  or that there is no need to submit a proxy if there is
               an intention to vote in favor of the  proposal).  In such a case,
               the PMG Designate must still determine how to vote the proxy, and
               convey this decision via email or other written  communication to
               the OG, with copy to the Compliance  Officer, as described above.
               If  the  PMG  Designate  decides  that  a  proxy  should  not  be
               submitted, the OG shall email the PMG Designate's decision to the
               UHF and keep a copy of that email in its files.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Rule 206(4)-6  under the Advisers Act requires that the proxy voting  procedures
adopted and implemented by a registered  investment  adviser include  procedures
that  address  material  conflicts  of  interest  that  may  arise  between  the
investment  adviser and its  clients.  Material  conflicts of interest may arise
when management of a JPMAAM investment  management client or prospective client,
distributor or prospective distributor of its investment management products, or
critical  vendor,  is  soliciting  proxies  and  failure  to  vote in  favor  of
management  may affect  JPMAAM's  relationship  with such company and materially
impact  JPMAAM's  business;  or when a  personal  relationship  between a JPMAAM
officer and management of a company or other proponents of proxy proposals could
impact the voting decision.  JPMAAM is a part of the global  financial  services
firm JPMC. Material conflicts of interest could also arise between the interests
of JPMC and JPMAAM clients.

                                       2
<PAGE>

To address such  material  conflicts  of interest,  JPMC and JPMAAM have adopted
policies to  safeguard  the  integrity  of  JPMAAM's  investment  processes  and
decisions,   including   proxy  voting,   and  to  maintain  the  integrity  and
independence  of the investment  process and decisions.  JPMAAM has  established
informational  barriers  designed to prevent the flow of information from JPMC's
securities,  lending,  investment  banking  and other  divisions  from  reaching
JPMAAM's investment professionals.

In  addition,  JPMAAM has  adopted the  procedures  discussed  in the  following
section to address material conflicts of interest.

ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The PMG  Designate,  along  with the  Compliance  Officer,  is  responsible  for
identifying potential material conflicts of interest.  When a potential material
conflict of interest has been identified between the interests of JPMAAM and its
clients, it is the responsibility of the investment professional in consultation
with senior  management  and the Proxy  Voting  Committee  (described  below) to
evaluate  the  matter  and  determine  whether an actual  material  conflict  of
interest exists.

In the event an actual material  conflict of interest  exists,  the final voting
decision will be made by the Proxy Voting Committee.

Depending upon the nature of the material conflict, JPMAAM may elect to take one
or more of the following measures, or other appropriate action:

     []   removing certain JPMAAM personnel from the proxy voting process;
     []   "walling off"  personnel  with  knowledge of the material  conflict to
          ensure that such personnel do not influence the relevant proxy vote;
     []   deferring  the vote to a proxy voting  service and vote in  accordance
          with their recommendation
     []   deferring the vote to an independent person or body (e.g., independent
          directors)

The resolution of all potential and actual material conflict issues presented to
the senior JPMAAM professionals will be thoroughly documented.

PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

A Proxy Voting  Committee  composed of senior  individuals  from JPMAAM,  Legal,
Compliance,  Risk  Management and Operations  Groups  provides  oversight of the
proxy voting process on an on-going basis. The primary purposes of the Committee
are to: periodically review general proxy voting matters and discuss and come to
conclusions on more controversial proxy voting issues.

RECORDKEEPING

JPMAAM is required to maintain in an easily  accessible place for five (5) years
all records  relating to the proxy  voting  process  (the first two years at the
office of JPMAAM).  Those  records  will be kept by the OG and will  include the
following:

     []   a copy of the JPMAAM Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures;
     []   a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of JPMAAM clients;
     []   a record of each vote cast on behalf of JPMAAM client holdings;
     []   a copy of all documents created by JPMAAM personnel that were material
          to  making a  decision  on the  voting of  client  securities  or that
          memorialize the basis of the decision; and
     []   A copy of each  written  request  by a client for  information  on how
          JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of the client, as well as a copy of any
          written  response  by JPMAAM to any  request  by a JPMAAM  client  for
          information on how JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of our client.

1.       PURPOSES

         This Code of Ethics (the "Code") has been  adopted by the  Directors of
the J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy  Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Fund"),  in accordance with
Rule 17j-1(c)  promulgated under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the  "Act").  Rule  17j-1  under the Act  generally  proscribes  fraudulent  or
manipulative  practices with respect to purchases or sales of Securities Held or
to be Acquired by investment  companies,  if effected by  associated  persons of
such  companies.  The  purpose  of  this  Code  is to  provide  regulations  and
procedures consistent with the Act and Rule 17j-1 designed to give effect to the
general prohibitions set forth in Rule 17j-1(b) as follows:

                  It is  unlawful  for any  affiliated  person  of or  principal
underwriter for the Fund, or any affiliated  person of an investment  adviser of
or principal  underwriter for the Fund, in connection with the purchase or sale,
directly or  indirectly,  by the person of a Security  Held or to be Acquired by
the Fund --

         (a)      To employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Fund;

         (b)      To make any untrue statement of a material fact to the Fund or
                  omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the
                  statements  made to the  Fund,  in light of the  circumstances
                  under which they are made, not misleading;

         (c)      To engage in any act,  practice,  or course of  business  that
                  operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the Fund; or

         (d)      To engage in any  manipulative  practice  with  respect to the
                  Fund.

2.       DEFINITIONS

         (a)      "Access Person" means any Director,  officer,  managing member

nonpublic information regarding the purchase or sale of securities for a Fund or
nonpublic  information regarding a Fund's portfolio holdings, or whose functions
relate to the making of any  recommendations  with respect to such  purchases or
sales or who has  access to such  recommendations  that are  nonpublic;  and any
natural  person in a control  relationship  to the Fund who obtains  information
concerning  recommendations made to the Fund with regard to the purchase or sale

<PAGE>

         (d)      "Beneficial Ownership" shall be interpreted in the same manner

person is the  beneficial  owner of a security for purposes of Section 16 of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and  regulations  thereunder (see
Annex A).  Any  report  required  by  Section  5(a) of this  Code may  contain a
statement  that the report will not be construed as an admission that the person
making  the  report  has any  direct or  indirect  beneficial  ownership  in the
Security to which the report relates.

         (e)      "Covered Security" shall have the meaning set forth in Section

certificates  of deposit,  commercial  paper and high  quality  short-term  debt
instruments, including repurchase agreements.

registered  under the Securities  Act of 1933, the issuer of which,  immediately
before the  registration,  was not  subject  to the  reporting  requirements  of
Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.

         (i)      "Investment  Personnel" means (i) any employee of the Fund (or
of any company in a control  relationship  to the Fund) who, in connection  with
his or her  regular  functions  or  duties,  makes  or  participates  in  making
recommendations  regarding the purchase or sale of  securities by the Fund;  and
(ii) any  natural  person  who  controls  the Fund and who  obtains  information
concerning  recommendations  made to the Fund  regarding the purchase or sale of
securities by the Fund.

         (j)      "Limited  Offering"  means an  offering  that is  exempt  from

the  Fund or is  being or has been  considered  by the Fund or its  adviser  for
purchase by the Fund;  and (ii) any option to purchase or sell, and any security
convertible into or exchangeable  for, a Covered  Security  described in Section
2(l)(i) of this Code.

         (m)      "Automatic  Investment  Plan" means a program in which regular
periodic  purchases  (or  withdrawals)  are  made  automatically  in  (or  from)
investment accounts in accordance with a predetermined  schedule and allocation.
An Automatic Investment Plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan.

3. PROHIBITED PURCHASES AND SALES

         (a)      No Access Person shall purchase or sell directly or indirectly
any Covered  Security  in which he or she has, or by reason of such  transaction
acquires,  any direct or indirect  Beneficial  Ownership and which to his or her
actual knowledge at the time of such purchase or sale:

                  (i) is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund; or

                  (ii) is being purchased or sold by the Fund.

         (b)      No Access  Person shall reveal to any other person  (except in
the normal  course of his or her  duties on behalf of the Fund) any  information
regarding  Covered  Securities  transactions by the Fund or consideration by the
Fund or its adviser of any such Covered Securities transactions.

         (c)      No  Access  Person  shall  recommend  any  Covered  Securities
transaction by the Fund without having disclosed his or her interest, if any, in
such Covered Securities or the issuer thereof,  including without limitation (i)
his or her direct or indirect Beneficial  Ownership of any Covered Securities of
such issuer,  (ii) any  contemplated  transaction by such person in such Covered
Securities  (iii) any position with such issuer or its  affiliates  and (iv) any
present or proposed business relationship between such issuer or its affiliates,
on the one  hand,  and such  person  or any  party in which  such  person  has a
significant  interest,  on the other;  provided,  however, that in the event the
interest  of such  Access  Person in such  Covered  Securities  or issuer is not
material to his or her personal net worth and any  contemplated  transaction  by
such person in such Covered  Securities  cannot reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on any such transaction by the Fund or on the market for
the Covered  Securities  generally,  such Access Person shall not be required to
disclose  his or her  interest in the Covered  Securities  or issuer  thereof in
connection with any such recommendation.

         (d)      No Investment  Personnel shall purchase any  Covered  Security
which is part of an Initial Public Offering.

4.       EXEMPTED TRANSACTIONS

         The prohibitions of Section 3 of this Code shall not apply to:

                                       3
<PAGE>

         (a)      Purchases  or sales  effected  in any  account  over which the
Access Person has no direct or indirect influence or control.

         (b)      Purchases  or  sales  of  Covered  Securities  which  are  not

extent such rights were acquired  from such issuer,  and sales of such rights so
acquired.

         (f)      Purchases or sales which are only remotely potentially harmful
to the Fund because they would be very unlikely to affect a highly institutional
market,  or because  they  clearly are not related  economically  to the Covered
Securities to be purchased, sold or held by the Fund.

5.       REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

         (a)      Every Access  Person must report to the  Adviser's  compliance

                              by the Adviser with  respect to the Access  Person
                              no later than 10 days after the  calendar  quarter
                              end,  if  all  of  the  information   required  by

                              since the Directors  generally have no involvement

                              purchased  or  sold  by  the  Fund  or  was  being
                              considered for purchase or sale by the Fund or the
                              Adviser.

          (c)  Each Access Person shall promptly  report any  transaction  which

               reports filed pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii).

          (d)  All reports  prepared  pursuant to this  Section 5 shall be filed
               with the person designated by the Adviser's compliance department
               to  review  these  materials  and  receive  from  them a  written

7.       FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE FUND'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         a.  The  Fund's  Directors,   including  a  majority  of  Disinterested
         Directors, must approve the code of ethics of the Fund, the Adviser and
         distributor and any material change to these codes. The Board must base
         its  approval  of a code  and any  material  changes  to the  code on a
         determination that the code contains provisions reasonably necessary to
         prevent Access Persons from engaging in any conduct  prohibited by Rule
         17j-1(b) of the Act as  described  in Section 1. Before  approving  the
         codes of the Adviser,  distributor  and the Fund, the Fund's Board must
         receive  certification from the Adviser,  distributor and the Fund that
         each has adopted  procedures  reasonably  necessary  to prevent  Access
         Persons  from  violating  its code of  ethics.  The  Fund's  Board must
         approve the codes of the Adviser and the distributor  before  initially
         retaining the services of the Adviser or distributor.  The Fund's Board
         must  approve a  material  change to a code not later  than six  months
         after adoption of the material change. The Adviser, distributor and the
         Fund  must  each use  reasonable  diligence  and  institute  procedures
         reasonably necessary to prevent violations of its code of ethics.

         b.  No less frequently than annually, the Adviser, distributor, and the
         Fund must furnish to the Fund's Board a written report that:

                  1.  Describes  any issues  arising under the code of ethics or
                  procedures since the last report to the Board, including,  but
                  not limited to,  information about material  violations of the
                  code or procedures  and  sanctions  imposed in response to the
                  material violations; and

                  2.  Certifies that the Adviser, the distributor,  and the Fund
                  have adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access
                  Persons from violating the code.

8.       SANCTIONS

         Upon  discovering  a violation of this Code,  the Directors of the Fund
may impose such  sanctions as they deem  appropriate,  including,  INTER ALIA, a
letter  of  censure  or  suspension  or  termination  of the  employment  of the
violator.

                  The  term  "beneficial  owner"  shall  mean  any  person  who,
         directly   or   indirectly,   through   any   contract,    arrangement,
         understanding,  relationship  or  otherwise,  has or shares a direct or
         indirect  pecuniary   interest  in  the  securities,   subject  to  the
         following:

         (i) The term "pecuniary interest" in any class of securities shall mean
         the  opportunity,  directly  or  indirectly,  to profit or share in any
         profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities.

         (ii) The term "indirect  pecuniary interest" in any class of securities
         shall include, but not be limited to:

               (A)  Securities  held by members of a person's  immediate  family
                    sharing  the same  household;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the
                    presumption of such beneficial ownership may be rebutted;

               (B)  A general partner's  proportionate interest in the portfolio
                    securities  held by a general  or limited  partnership.  The
                    general partner's  proportionate  interest,  as evidenced by
                    the  partnership  agreement  in  effect  at the  time of the
                    transaction  and the  partnership's  most  recent  financial
                    statements,  shall  be  the  greater  of:  (1)  the  general
                    partner's  share  of the  partnership's  profits,  including
                    profits attributed to any limited partnership interests held
                    by the general  partner and any other  interests  in profits
                    that arise from the purchase  and sale of the  partnership's
                    portfolio securities;  or (2) the general partner's share of
                    the  partnership   capital  account,   including  the  share
                    attributable to any limited partnership interest held by the
                    general partner;

               (C)  A  performance-related  fee, other than an asset-based  fee,
                    received by any broker,  dealer,  bank,  insurance  company,
                    investment company,  investment adviser, investment manager,
                    trustee or person or entity  performing a similar  function;
                    PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no  pecuniary  interest  shall  be
                    present where (1) the performance-related fee, regardless of
                    when  payable,  is  calculated  based upon net capital gains
                    and/or net capital appreciation generated from the portfolio
                    or from the fiduciary's overall performance over a period of
                    one year or more;  and (2)  securities  of the issuer do not
                    account for more than 10 percent of the market  value of the
                    portfolio.  A right to a  nonperformance-related  fee  alone
                    shall not represent a pecuniary interest in the securities;

               (D)  A person's right to dividends that is separated or separable
                    from  the  underlying  securities.  Otherwise,  a  right  to
                    dividends alone shall not represent a pecuniary  interest in
                    the securities;

               (E)  A person's  interest in the securities  held by a trust,  as
                    follows:

                           (1) TRUSTEES.  If a trustee has a pecuniary interest,
                           as provided  above,  in any holding or transaction in
                           the  issuer's  securities  held  by the  trust,  such
                           holding or  transaction  shall be  attributed  to the
                           trustee in the trustee's individual capacity, as well
                           as  on  behalf  of  the   trust.   With   respect  to
                           performance   fees  and  holdings  of  the  trustee's
                           immediate family,  trustees shall be deemed to have a
                           pecuniary   interest  in  the  trust   holdings   and
                           transactions  in the following  circumstances:  (i) a
                           performance  fee is  received  that does not meet the
                           proviso of paragraph  (ii)(C) above;  or (ii)at least
                           one  beneficiary  of the  trust  is a  member  of the
                           trustee's immediate family. The pecuniary interest of
                           the immediate family member(s) shall be attributed to
                           the trustee;

                           (2) BENEFICIARIES.  A beneficiary shall have or share
                           reporting obligations with respect to transactions in
                           the  issuer's  securities  held by the trust,  if the
                           beneficiary is a beneficial  owner of the securities,
                           as follows:

                                    (aa)  If  a  beneficiary  shares  investment
                                    control  with the trustee  with respect to a
                                    trust transaction,  the transaction shall be
                                    attributed to both the  beneficiary  and the
                                    trust;

                                    (bb) If a beneficiary has investment control
                                    with respect to a trust transaction  without
                                    consultation    with   the   trustee,    the
                                    transaction   shall  be  attributed  to  the
                                    beneficiary only; and

                                    (cc) In making a determination as to whether
                                    a beneficiary is the beneficial owner of the
                                    securities, beneficiaries shall be deemed to
                                    have a pecuniary  interest  in the  issuer's
                                    securities  held by the trust to the  extent
                                    of their  pro  rata  interest  in the  trust
                                    where   the   trustee   does  not   exercise
                                    exclusive investment control.

                           (3)  SETTLORS.  If a  settlor  reserves  the right to
                           revoke  the trust  without  the  consent  of  another
                           person,  the trust holdings and transactions shall be
                           attributed  to the  settlor  instead  of  the  trust;
                           provided,  however,  that  if the  settlor  does  not
                           exercise  or  share   investment   control  over  the
                           issuer's  securities  held by the  trust,  the  trust
                           holdings and transactions  shall be attributed to the
                           trust instead of the settlor; and

               (F)  A person's right to acquire  securities through the exercise
                    or conversion  of any  derivative  security,  whether or not
                    presently exercisable.

         (iii) A shareholder shall not be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in
         the portfolio  securities  held by a corporation  or similar  entity in
         which  the  person  owns   securities  if  the  shareholder  is  not  a
         controlling  shareholder  of the  entity  and  does  not  have or share
         investment control over the entity's portfolio.
