INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.
SEMIANNUAL REPORT
SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

<Page>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.


November 15, 2004

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We present you with the semiannual report for Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.
(the "Fund") for the six months ended September 30, 2004.

PERFORMANCE

Over the six-month period, the Fund's net asset value return was 1.77%. On a
market price basis, the Fund's return declined 4.18%. During the same time
period, the Fund's peer group, as measured by the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt
Funds (Leveraged) median, generated net asset value and market price returns of
1.48% and -2.09%, respectively. (For more performance information, please refer
to "Performance At A Glance" on page 5.)

The Fund used leverage during the period--38.8% of total assets as of September
30, 2004--which added slightly to the Fund's yield. Leverage can magnify returns
on the upside and on the downside, and can create wider dispersions of returns
within the Fund's peer group.

The Fund traded at a discount to NAV at the end of September. This discount was
wider than the average of the funds in its Lipper peer group.

A Fund trades at a discount when the market price at which its shares trade is
less than its net asset value (NAV). Alternately, a fund trades at a premium
when the market price at which its shares trade is more than its NAV. The market
price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of a fund at a given
time, and may be influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand
and market conditions. NAV per common share is determined by dividing the value
of the Fund's securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the
total number of common shares outstanding.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER WILLIAM VERONDA

Q.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.  The economy continued to expand, although it lost some traction as the
    reporting period progressed. In the first quarter of 2004, gross domestic
    product (GDP) came in at 4.5%, up from 4.1% in the prior quarter. Second
    quarter GDP

    then fell to 3.3%. During its August 10, 2004 meeting, the Federal Reserve
    Board (the "Fed") stated that, "In recent months, output growth has
    moderated and the pace of improvement in labor-market conditions has
    slowed." There was no shortage of economic data to substantiate the Fed's
    findings.

Q.  HOW DID THE FED REACT TO THESE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS?

A.  After many months of speculation, the Fed raised the federal funds rate (or
    "fed funds" rate)--the rate that banks charge one another for funds they
    borrow on an overnight basis--from 1.00% to 1.25% on June 30, 2004. The Fed
    raised rates again at its subsequent meetings on August 10, 2004 and
    September 21, 2004, to 1.50% and 1.75%, respectively. In doing so, it noted
    that, "Even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains
    accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is
    providing ongoing support to economic activity." Market perception grew that
    the Fed, through its statements and in its actions, was paving the way to
    continue raising rates in the future.

Q.  HOW DID YOU POSITION THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.  The Fund's duration was shorter relative to its benchmark during the period,
    as we believed that yields would continue to rise given the ongoing strength
    of the economy. While this positioning enhanced performance in the first
    half of the period, it detracted from results over the last three months.
    However, our yield curve positioning helped offset some of this performance,
    as our expectations for a flattening yield curve were met (the curve
    flattens when the gap between short- and long-term yields narrows). In
    particular, in recent months we emphasized securities in the 5- to 10-year
    and 20- to 30-year portions of the curve, while holding underweight
    positions in the 1- to 5-year and the 10- to 15-year ranges of the curve.

Q.  WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR APPROACH IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL MARKET?

A.  California was one of a number of states that saw its fiscal situation
    improve during the six-month period. Thus, we added a number of California
    issues to our portfolio, including a block of the state's Economic Recovery
    Bonds. Overall, the Fund's California holdings enhanced results over the
    period covered by this report.

    Another state that has shored up its balance sheet in recent months is
    Massachusetts. We are, therefore, looking to increase the Fund's exposure to
    this state's municipal securities.

Q.  WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR?

A.  Given declining government reimbursements, we remain negative on the
    healthcare sector in general. However, using our research capabilities, we
    identified a number of securities that we believe offer attractive yields
    and, in our opinion, more than compensate investors for the potential risks.

                                        2

Q.  THE TROUBLES IN THE AIRLINE SECTOR HAVE BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED. DOES THE FUND
    HAVE ANY EXPOSURE TO THIS AREA?

A.  While the airline industry is experiencing high-profile issues, we continue
    to find attractive opportunities in the airport sector. Over the last year,
    both business and consumer flight trends have improved. Given the
    expectations for a continuation of an economic expansion, we expect
    airfreight usage will remain strong. An example of a portfolio holding in
    this area is Cleveland Ohio Airport bonds (1.8%)* that mature in 2014.

Q.  WERE THERE ANY OTHER STRATEGIES THAT AFFECTED THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE DURING
    THE PERIOD?

A.  As we mentioned in our last report to you, we increased the Fund's leverage
    from approximately 33% to 40% at the end of December 2003. Although leverage
    can cause the Fund's short-term volatility to increase, it also better
    positions us to seek our goal of a high level of current income exempt from
    federal income tax, consistent with the preservation of capital. We
    therefore maintained the Fund's leverage at roughly 40% over the period.

Q.  HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE POSITIONING THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?

A.  Although the US economy experienced a "soft patch" during the third quarter,
    it now appears that this may have been overstated. In addition, aside from
    stubbornly high oil prices, inflation remains low. We believe the Fed will
    continue to raise interest rates--in fact, on November 10, 2004, the Fed
    raised the federal funds rate another 25 basis points to 2.00%--and, as
    such, we expect to retain our short duration position. We also anticipate
    remaining focused on the 5- to 10-year and 20- to 30-year portions of the
    yield curve.

    We will continue to look for opportunities in the general obligation market,
    in particular issues from the state of California. Having said that, we
    expect to avoid securities in the 1- to 5-year range, as we do not believe
    they are attractive given the underlying risks. On a national level, we will
    seek higher-yielding securities that appear attractive given their
    risk/reward characteristics.

Past performance does not predict future performance. The return and principal
value of an investment will fluctuate, so that an investor's shares, when sold,
may be worth more or less than their original cost. NAV return assumes, for
illustration only, that dividends were reinvested at the net asset value on the
payable dates. NAV and market price returns for periods of less than one year
are cumulative. Returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
could pay on Fund distributions.

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income tax,
consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that the
Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

In the normal course of business the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations or that provide indemnification for certain
liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not
yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Fund's management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates net asset values based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio's securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use last reported
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). The amortized cost method of valuation, which
approximates market value, generally is used to value short-term debt
instruments with sixty days or less remaining to maturity, unless the Board
determines that this does not represent fair value. Securities traded in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") market are valued at the last bid price available on
the valuation date prior to valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

                                       21
<Page>

FUTURES CONTRACTS--Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is
required to deposit in a segregated account with its custodian, in the name of
the futures broker through which the transaction was effected, an amount of cash
and/or municipal obligations equal to a certain percentage of the contract
amount. This amount is known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments, known
as "variation margin" are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on
the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial futures
contracts. Such variation margin is recorded for financial statement purposes on
a daily basis as unrealized gain or loss until the financial futures contract is
closed, at which time the net gain or loss is reclassified to realized gain or
loss on futures. Variation margin calls could be substantial in the event of
adverse price movements.

Using financial futures contracts involves various market risks. If the Fund was
unable to liquidate a futures position due to the absence of a liquid secondary
market or the imposition of price limits, it could incur substantial losses. The
Fund would continue to be subject to market risk with respect to the position.
In addition, the Fund would continue to be required to make variation margin
payments and might be required to maintain the position being hedged or to
maintain cash or securities in a segregated account. Furthermore, certain
characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with
movements in the prices of the investments being hedged, including temporary
price distortion.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders at a level rate that over time will result in the distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend rate on the common
stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund.
Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued daily.
The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions from net
realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

                                       22

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM"), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator
of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management
subsidiary of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization with
headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland and operations in many areas of the
financial services industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract, the Fund
pays UBS Global AM an investment advisory and administration fee, which is
accrued weekly and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and Auction Preferred
Shares. UBS Global AM had agreed to waive 0.20% of the advisory and
administration fee, so that the Fund's effective fee was 0.70% of average weekly
net assets applicable to holders of common and Auction Preferred Shares.
Effective August 1, 2004, the Fund's management fee waiver increased to 0.30%,
reducing the effective management fee to 0.60%. This waiver will continue
indefinitely unless the Board agrees to any change. At September 30, 2004, the
Fund owed UBS Global AM $258,549, which is $387,923 investment advisory and
administration fees less fees waived of $129,374. For the six months ended
September 30, 2004, UBS Global AM waived $607,086 in investment advisory and
administration fees from the Fund.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A, 800 shares
of Auction Preferred Shares Series B, 800 shares of Auction Preferred Shares
Series C, 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D, 600 shares of Auction
Preferred Shares Series E and 600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series F
which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." All shares of each
series of APS have liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount
equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for each
Series of APS. Dividend rates ranged from 0.750% to 1.590% for the six months
ended September 30, 2004.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

                                       23
<Page>

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

Offering expenses of $723,487 were charged to paid-in-capital of the Fund in
connection with the offering of APS during the year ended March 31, 2004.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the six months ended September 30, 2004, aggregate purchases and sales of
portfolio securities, excluding short-term securities, were $113,492,514 and
$116,165,833, respectively.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income, net
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2004 was as follows:

The Fund was informed that there were no broker non-votes. (Broker non-votes are

not been received from the beneficial owners or other

                                       26

persons entitled to vote and for which the broker does not have discretionary
voting authority.)

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND RECORD

You may obtain a description of the Fund's proxy voting policies and procedures,
and its proxy voting record, without charge, upon request by contacting the Fund
directly at 1-800-647 1568, online on the Fund's Web site
www.ubs.com/ubsglobalam-proxy, or on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website
(http://www.sec.gov).

QUARTERLY FORM N-Q PORTFOLIO SCHEDULE

The Fund will file its complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the first and third quarters of
each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Forms N-Q are available on the SEC's
website at http://www.sec.gov. The Fund's Forms N-Q may be reviewed and copied
at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the
operation of the SEC's Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling
1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, you may obtain copies of Forms N-Q from the Fund
upon request by calling 1-800-647-1568.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own
names, or in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have
all dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock
automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such
common shareholders elect to receive cash. Common shareholders who elect to hold
their shares in the name of another broker or nominee should contact such broker
or nominee to determine whether, or how, they may participate in the Plan.The
ability of such shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if their
shares are transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time. Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's transfer agent
and should include the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the
share certificate or in the transfer agent's records. An election to terminate
participation in the Plan, until such election is changed, will be deemed an
election by a common shareholder to take all subsequent distributions in cash.
An election will be effective only for distributions declared and having a
record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is received.

                                       27
<Page>

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend payable
to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including applicable
brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in the open
market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in connection
with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for reinvesting
dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However, each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with respect to any
dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution. The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence,
Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331-1710.
