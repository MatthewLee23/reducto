1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation--Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income--Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2005 was $341,368,012, and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $362,724,520, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $367,793,174 and $5,068,654, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee of management,
and recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $38,847,355 and
$45,567,142, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the risk of
possible illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security
values. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2005
can be found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2005 were as follows:

par value.

On December 27, 2004, the Corporation issued 380,149 shares of its Common Stock

5.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's qualified defined benefit pension plan covers all employees
with at least one year of service. In addition, the Corporation has a
nonqualified defined benefit plan which provides eligible employees with
retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan. Benefits are based on
length of service and compensation during the last five years of employment.
The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June
30, 2005, the Corporation contributed $437,338 to the plans. The Corporation
anticipates contributing additional amounts to the plans approximating $23,338
during the remainder of 2005.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic
pension cost for the six months ended June 30, 2005.

<TABLE>

                 ---------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the
Corporation expensed contributions of $41,543. The Corporation does not provide
postretirement medical benefits.

6.  Stock-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") permits the issuance of
stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up to 895,522
shares of the Corporations's Common Stock at the fair market value on the date
of grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation
rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by the
Corporation during subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less
than one year after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant. The
stock appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to
exercise their options and receive cash in an amount equal to the difference
between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the Common Stock
at the date of surrender. All options terminate 10 years from the date of grant
if not exercised. With the adoption of the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation
Plan ("2005 Plan") at the 2005 Annual Meeting, no further grants will be made
under the 1985 Plan, although unexercised awards granted in 2004 and prior
years remain outstanding.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2005, and
changes during the period then ended is presented below:

date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $470,783.

The 2005 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock. Restricted stock was granted to key employees on
April 27, 2005 at fair market value on that date, vesting over a three year
period. Restricted stock units were granted to non-employee directors on April
27, 2005 at fair market value on that date and vest over a one year period. The
number of shares of Common Stock which remain available for future grants under
the Plan at June 30, 2005 is 864,409 shares. The Corporation pays dividends and
dividend equivalents on outstanding awards, which are charged to net assets
when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents paid on awards that are later
forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Corporations's awards granted as of June 30,
2005, and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted under the 2005 Plan are recognized over the relevant service period
based on the fair value of the awards granted. Any unearned compensation is
included in "Undistributed net investment income" and is subsequently expensed
as services are rendered. The fair value of restricted shares is based on the
average of the high and low market price on the date an award is granted. The
total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to employees for the six
months ended June 30, 2005 was $7,218. The total compensation costs for
restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors under the 2005 Plan
for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $16,836. As of June 30, 2005, there
was $206,880 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

7.  EXPENSES

The aggregate remuneration paid or accrued during the six months ended June 30,
2005 to officers and directors amounted to $907,946, of which $150,169 was paid
as fees to directors who were not officers.

8.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are
secured at all times by collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of
securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will be for the
account of the Corporation. At June 30, 2005, the Corporation had no securities
on loan.

                                                                             7

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at June 30, 2005, and the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at June 30, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
