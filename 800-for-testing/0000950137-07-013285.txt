PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period. The trust's adviser has waived or reimbursed fees and
expenses from time to time; absent such waivers/ reimbursements the trust's
returns would have been lower.

The Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index is an
unmanaged, broad based index that reflects the general performance of the U.S.
dollar denominated, fixed-rate, non-investment grade, taxable corporate bond
market. Issuers are capped at 2% of the index. It is not possible to invest
directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2007

MARKET CONDITIONS

Moderate economic growth, accommodating Treasury yields, low defaults and
reasonably good earnings combined to push high-yield debt prices higher during
the first quarter of 2007. As a result, spreads tightened by two basis points
for the quarter to close at 297 basis points over Treasuries, and the high-
yield sector outperformed both equities and Treasuries. During that time,
investors seemed confident that slower, but moderate economic growth and lower
interest rates would continue to be positive for high-yield companies. In the
second quarter, however, the high-yield market faced a host of headwinds,
including higher volatility, rising interest rates, ongoing problems in the sub-
prime mortgage market, and heavy new issue supply. The new issue calendar was
particularly heavy in May and June and included many aggressive, lower-rated
deals, some of which had to be postponed late in the quarter due to market
conditions and a general lack of interest. These factors contributed to a
decline in high-yield prices in June and only a slightly positive return for the
sector for the overall quarter. Nonetheless, high-yield still outperformed
Treasuries for the quarter, but underperformed equities. Spreads widened by 18
basis points to close the period 16 basis points wider than at the beginning of
the year, but still much tighter than they have historically been. These tight
spreads generally reflected many factors that remained positive for the high-
yield market, including very low default rates, moderate economic growth, global
demand for high yield, and solid corporate earnings.

The Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") left the target federal funds rate
unchanged at 5.25 percent throughout the reporting period, but stated that
inflation risks still remain a concern. Early in the year, when first-quarter
gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to just 0.7 percent, the market began
to speculate that the Fed might ease monetary policy and reduce the federal
funds rate, but as the economic outlook began to improve and inflation began to
moderate, these expectations dissipated as it became apparent the Fed would
remain on hold.

The high-yield market benefited from ongoing strong demand as investors
continued to reach for yield. As such, CCC rated securities outperformed
higher-quality issues for the overall period. Industry returns varied
considerably, but for the overall period, transportation services, wireless
communications, and cable turned in the best performance while finance
companies, home construction, and utilities were the worst performers.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the Trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. The Trust underperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers U.S.
Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index, on both an NAV and market price basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and Trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

Although high-yield spreads widened in the latter months of the reporting
period, they still remained tight by historical standards. As such, we continue
to believe there is a strong likelihood that spreads will widen, which led us to
maintain the Trust's higher credit-rating profile. Although this defensive
positioning was beneficial late in the period when spreads widened, it detracted
from performance for the overall period as lower-quality bonds generally
outperformed.

The Trust's interest-rate positioning was also somewhat defensive as we
maintained a lower relative duration (a measure of interest rate sensitivity)
throughout the period. During the first quarter of the year, this positioning
dampened performance as interest rates generally declined. In the second
quarter, however, interest rates rose and the lower duration proved additive to
returns. As a result, the Trust's duration had a minimal impact on performance
for the overall period.

Strong security selection in various sectors, including energy and utilities,
added to relative returns, as did an underweight to the buildings products/home
builders sector early in the period. Conversely, security selection in
auto/vehicle parts and telecommunication services detracted from performance.

We continued to seek to maintain a balanced and well-diversified portfolio while
allowing for strategic overweights in securities and sectors that we believed
possessed the most attractive risk profiles. In terms of issuer size, we

                                                                               3

focus on larger companies because of their financial flexibility, their ability
to withstand less favorable financial conditions, and their superior access to
capital markets. These strategies led to major sector overweights in the energy,
health care, and food and tobacco sectors as of the end of the period. The
largest sectors underweights were in technology, cable, telecom, and media.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. During the course of the
period, the Trust's borrowing activity became more expensive, thereby tempering
its benefits.

The Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when appropriate,
repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is lower at the time of
purchase. This may help support the market value of the trust's shares.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES/PORTFOLIO MANAGER CHANGE

The fund approved changes/clarifications in its investment policies to allow the
fund to enter into the following transactions.

OPTIONS ON SWAPS.  The fund may write (sell) and purchase put and call swap
options. A swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right (but
not the obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend,
cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some designated future
time on specified terms. The Fund may use swap options for hedging purposes or
to manage and mitigate the credit and interest rate risk of the fund.

obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or
otherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some designated future time on
specified terms. The fund may write (sell) and purchase put and call swap
options. The use of swap options involves risks, including, among others,
changes in the market value of securities held by the fund, and of swap options
relating to those securities may not be proportionate, (ii) there may not be a
liquid market for the fund to sell a swap option, which could result in
difficulty closing a position, (iii) swap options can magnify the extent of
losses incurred due to changes in the market value of the securities to which
they relate and (iv) counterparty risk.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

At meetings held on April 17, 2007 and May 30, 2007, the Board of Trustees, and
the independent trustees voting separately, considered and ultimately determined
that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and
approved the continuance of the investment advisory agreement as being in the
best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In making its determination,
the Board of Trustees considered materials that were specifically prepared by
the investment adviser at the request of the Board and Fund counsel, and by an
independent provider of investment company data contracted to assist the Board,
relating to the investment advisory agreement review process. The Board also
considered information received periodically about the portfolio, performance,
the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and expenses of the
Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the investment advisory agreement over a
period of several months and the trustees held sessions both with the investment
adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and considering
the investment advisory agreement.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of

 8
<PAGE>

factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the level of advisory fees for this
Fund relative to comparable funds and other products advised by the adviser and
others in the marketplace. The trustees review not only the advisory fees but
other fees and expenses (whether paid to the adviser, its affiliates or others)
and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The Board has determined that the
performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support its decision to approve the
investment advisory agreement.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio
management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated
expenses both on an

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that the analysis of the
investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory agreement.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory agreement.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to
provide high current income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital
through investment in a professionally managed diversified portfolio of high
yield, fixed income securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not readily available, valuations are
obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price
established each day on the exchange on which they are traded. Short-term
securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At June 30, 2007, the Trust had $402,141 of when-issued
or delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

income is comprised primarily of consent fees. Consent fees are earned as
compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of debt instruments.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Trust files tax returns with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and various
states. Generally, the tax authorities can examine all tax returns filed for the
last three years. If applicable, the Trust recognizes interest accrued related
to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in "Other"
expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust adopted the provisions of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Interpretation number 48
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on June 30, 2007. As of June 30,
2007, this did not result in an impact to the Fund's financial statements.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2006, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $62,923,467 which will expire according to the
following schedule.

                                                                ==========
</Table>

    As of December 31, 2006, there were no components of distributable earnings
on a tax basis.

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets including preferred shares of
the Trust. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Adviser voluntarily
waived $36,414 of its investment advisory fees. This represents .05% of the
average daily net assets including preferred shares of the Trust. This waiver is
voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.

    For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $7,100 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the six months ended June 30,
2007, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $21,400 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

</Table>

*   For the period ended June 30, 2007, the Trust repurchased 42,294 of its
    shares at an average discount of 6.269% from net asset value per share.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $28,587,591 and $27,924,726,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as
to attempt to protect the Trust against possible changes in the market value of
its portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Trust's portfolio
holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with
the change in value reflected in the unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Upon
disposition, a realized gain or loss is recognized accordingly, except when
taking delivery of a security underlying a futures contract. In this instance,
the recognition of gain or loss is postponed until the disposal of the security
underlying the futures contract. Risk may arise as a result of the potential
inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

    During the period the Trust invested in futures contracts, a type of
derivative. A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery of a
particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The Trust
generally invests in futures on U.S. Treasury Bonds or Notes. Upon entering into
futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of cash or liquid securities
with a value equal to a percentage of the contract amount with either a futures
commission merchant pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940
Act, as amended, or with its custodian in an account in the broker's name. This
amount is known as initial margin. During the period the futures contract is
open, payments are received from or made to the broker based upon changes in the
value of the contract (the variation margin). The risk of loss associated with a
futures contract is in excess of the variation margin reflected on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities.

                                                                              25

</Table>

6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 2,616 APS. Series A contains 1,112 shares and Series B
contains 1,504 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate on each
series is currently reset every 28 days through an auction process. The average
rate in effect on June 30, 2007 was 5.261%. During the six months ended June 30,
2007, the rates ranged from 5.000% to 5.300%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

8. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS
157 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

I, Stuart N. Schuldt, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSRS of Van Kampen High Income Trust
     II;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

     d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
