             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Managers of
  Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Company"),  including
the schedules of portfolio investments,  securities sold, not yet purchased, and
swap contracts as of December 31, 2006, and the related  statement of operations
for the year then ended,  and the statements of changes in members'  capital for
each of the two years in the period then ended.  These financial  statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting.  Our audits
included  consideration of internal control over financial  reporting as a basis
for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but
not for the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no
such  opinion.  An audit also  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2006, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Advantage  Advisers  Xanthus
Fund,  L.L.C.  at December 31, 2006,  the results of its operations for the year
then ended, and the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended, in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of  Managers").  There are
         six  members of the Board of  Managers,  one of whom is  considered  an
         "interested  person" under the Act. On March 1, 2006, the Company named
         James E. Buck as lead Independent Manager of the Board of Managers. The
         Company's investment adviser is Advantage Advisers Management,  L.L.C.,
         a Delaware limited liability company (the "Adviser").  The Adviser is a
         subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer   Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM")  and  an
         affiliate of  Oppenheimer  & Co. Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is
         responsible for managing the Company's  investment  activities pursuant
         to an  investment  advisory  agreement  dated June 5, 2003.  OAM is the
         managing member of the Adviser,  and Alkeon Capital  Management  L.L.C.
         ("Alkeon")  is  a  non-managing  member  of  the  Adviser.   Investment
         professionals  employed by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who
         serves  as  the  Company's  portfolio  manager,  manage  the  Company's
         portfolio  on  behalf of the  Adviser  under  the  supervision  of OAM.
         Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  At a meeting  held on
         November 1, 2004,  the Board of Managers  approved  the  acceptance  of
         initial  contributions  by the  Company  from new  members  on or after
         January 1, 2005.  The Company may from time to time offer to repurchase
         interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such repurchases will
         be made at such  times and on such  terms as may be  determined  by the
         Board of Managers,  in their  complete and  exclusive  discretion.  The
         Adviser  expects  that  generally  it will  recommend  to the  Board of
         Managers that the Company offer to  repurchase  interests  from Members
         twice each year,  effective at the end of the second fiscal quarter and
         again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         A.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i)  Domestic exchange traded securities (other than options and those
              securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

              (1) at their last composite sale prices as reported on the
                  exchanges where those securities are traded; or

              (2) If no sales of those securities are reported on a particular
                  day, the securities are valued based upon their composite bid
                  prices for securities held long, or their composite asked
                  prices for securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported by
                  those exchanges.

         (ii) Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

              (1) at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is the
                  last trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern Time) adjusted
                  up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the last traded price is
                  below such bid and down to NASDAQ's best offer price if the
                  last trade is above such offer price); or

              (2) if no NOCP is available, at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                  prior to the calculation of the net asset value of the
                  Company; or

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

            (4) if no sale is shown and no bid price is available, the price
                will be deemed "stale" and the value will be determined in
                accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Disclosures  about  Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement  ofAssets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         C. CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within three months at the time of purchase as cash equivalents.

         D. INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes on
         the  profits of the  Company is made as the  Members  are  individually
         liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

         The  Company  has   reclassified   ($2,272,925)  and  $50,724,619  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2006.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         During the year ended December 31, 2006, Oppenheimer earned $251,654 as
         brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of
         the Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a  broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,  earned  $1,522,053  as brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the year ended
         December 31, 2006, an Incentive  Allocation of $15,713,324 was credited
         to the Special  Advisory  Member's  capital account and was included in
         withdrawals  payable at December 31, 2006,  in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  The
         lead independent manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers
         who are  "interested  persons"  do not  receive any annual or other fee
         from  the  Company.  Managers  who are  not  "interested  persons"  are
         reimbursed  by the Company for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

         PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian") serves as custodian of the
         Company's assets.

         PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to
         the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
         recordkeeping and investor related  services.  The Company pays PFPC an
         accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the average net
         assets  of the  Company  as of the  last  day of  each  month,  payable
         monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its  discretion.  For the year ended  December 31, 2006,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $156,650.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2006, amounted
         to $2,677,113,040 and $2,637,436,507, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,   for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  amounted  to
         $1,510,786,614 and $1,609,068,843, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2006,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $483,709,250, and $214,852,584, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2006,  accumulated net
         unrealized  appreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet purchased was  $28,897,783,  consisting  of  $41,381,068  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $12,483,285 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet  purchased,  net of excess  cash,  held at the  prime  broker as of
         December 31, 2006.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  As of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
         had no outstanding margin borrowings.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include options,
         swaps  and  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,  these
         financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell
         other  financial  instruments  at specific  terms at  specified  future
         dates. Each of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of
         off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the
         securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets,  liabilities and members' capital. Primarily all investments in
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased and due from broker are positions
         with,  and  amounts  due  from,  the  prime  broker,   Morgan  Stanley.
         Accordingly,  the Fund has a concentration  of individual  counterparty
         credit risk with the prime  broker.  The Fund pledges  securities in an
         account at PFPC Trust Company,  for the benefit of the prime broker, to
         meet the margin requirement as determined by the prime broker.

         A swap is a contract  under  which two parties  agree to make  periodic
         payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index or
         the value of some other instrument,  applied to a stated, or "notional"
         amount.  Swaps  generally  can be  classified  as interest  rate swaps,
         currency swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include
         contracts for difference,  depending on the type of index or instrument
         used to calculate the payments.  Such swaps would  increase or decrease
         the Company's  investment  exposure to the  particular  interest  rate,
         currency,  commodity or equity  involved.  Securities  associated  with
         swaps are marked-to-market  based on the Company's valuation procedures
         that are outlined in Section 2b of these notes.  The change in value of
         swaps,  including  the  periodic  amounts  of  interest  to be  paid or
         received on swaps,  is reported  as  unrealized  gains or losses in the
         Statement of Operations.  Net unrealized gains are reported as an asset
         and net unrealized  losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
         of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. A realized gain or loss is
         recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination
         of swap agreements.

         Most  swap   agreements   entered  into  by  the  Company  require  the
         calculation  of the  obligations  of the parties to the agreements on a
         "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap
         agreement  generally will be equal to only to the net amount to be paid
         or received  under the  agreement  based on the relative  values of the
         positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         The Company is subject to the market risk  associated  with  changes in
         the  value  of the  underlying  investment  or  instrument,  as well as
         exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on
         swap  contracts.  The risk of loss with  respect to swaps is limited to
         the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually  obligated
         to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the Fund's risk of loss
         consists of the net amount of payments  that the Company  contractually
         is  entitled  to  receive,  which  may be  different  than the  amounts
         recorded on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         The  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather  than the  notional
         amount,  represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
         respectively.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the

      9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         On July 13,  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         released FASB  Interpretation  No. 48  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in
         Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides  guidance for how uncertain tax
         positions  should be recognized,  measured,  presented and disclosed in
         the  financial  statements.  FIN  48  requires  the  evaluation  of tax
         positions  taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
         Company's  tax  returns to  determine  whether  the tax  positions  are
         "more-likely-than-not"   of  being  sustained  by  the  applicable  tax
         authority.  Tax positions  not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not
         threshold  would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current
         year.  Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years  beginning after
         December  15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
         effective date. Recent SEC guidance allows deferring the implementation
         of FIN 48. As a result, the Company will incorporate FIN 48 in its semi
         annual report on June 30, 2007.

         In September  2006,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157, "FAIR VALUE
         MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
         value for  financial  reporting,  establishes a framework for measuring
         fair value and requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair
         value  measurements.  FAS 157 is effective  for  fianancial  statements
         issued for fiscal years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim
         periods within those fiscal years. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
         does not  believe  the  adoption  of FAS 157 will  impact  the  amounts
         reported in the financial statements,  however,  additional disclosures
         will be required about the inputs used to develop the  measurements  of
         fair value and the effect of certain of the  measurements  reported  in
         the statement of operations for a fiscal year.

     10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         Subsequent  to December 31, 2006 and through  February  22,  2007,  the
         Company  received  initial and additional  capital  contributions  from
         Members of $10,412,783.

                         ALKEON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                             As of December 31, 2006



PROXY VOTING POLICIES

Alkeon has entered into an agreement  with  Institutional  Shareholder  Services
("ISS"), an independent third party, for ISS to provide Alkeon with its research
on proxies  and to  facilitate  the  electronic  voting of  proxies.  Alkeon has
adopted ISS's proxy voting  policies in order to ensure that it votes proxies in
the best interests of its clients. Alkeon has instructed ISS to vote all proxies
in accordance with this policy, unless instructed by Alkeon to vote otherwise.

Alkeon  generally votes in favor of routine  corporate  housekeeping  proposals,
such  as  proposals  to  ratify  auditors  and  reasonably  crafted  shareholder
proposals  calling for directors to be elected with an  affirmative  majority of
votes.  For all other  proposals,  Alkeon will vote in accordance with the proxy
voting guidelines adopted by ISS.

Clients  may obtain a copy of the Proxy  Procedures  and  information  about how
Alkeon voted a client's  proxies by  contacting  Greg  Jakubowsky  via e-mail at
gjakubowsky@alkeoncapital.com or by telephone at (212) 389-8710.

Alkeon may make cash payments to third parties who provide  client  referrals in
accordance with Rule 206(4)-3 of the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940. Except as
described in the preceding sentence, Alkeon does not enter into agreements with,
or make commitments to, any  broker-dealer  that would bind Alkeon to compensate
that broker-dealer,  directly or indirectly for client referrals.  However, when
one or more  broker-dealer  is believed  capable of providing the best price and
execution with respect to a particular portfolio transaction,  Alkeon may select
a  broker-dealer  who may have  referred  clients  to  Alkeon,  or who may refer
clients  to  Alkeon  in the  future.  In doing so,  Alkeon  does not pay  higher
commissions than those that would be paid to other  broker-dealers  on a similar
transaction.

         POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

         Actual or apparent  conflicts  of  interest  may arise when a Portfolio
         Manager  also has  day-to-day  responsibilities  with respect to one or
         more accounts. These potential conflicts include:

     o   Allocation of Limited Time and Attention. Because the Portfolio Manager
         manages  other  accounts,  the  Portfolio  Manager  may  not be able to
         formulate  as  complete  a  strategy  or  identify  equally  attractive
         investment opportunities for each of those accounts as if the Portfolio
         Manager were to devote  substantially  more attention to the management
         of fewer accounts.

     o   Allocation  of  Investment  Opportunities.  If  the  Portfolio  Manager
         identifies an investment  opportunity that may be suitable for multiple
         accounts,  the  Fund  may not be able to take  full  advantage  of that
         opportunity  because the opportunity may need to be allocated among all
         or many of these accounts.

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

     o   Pursuit of Differing  Strategies.  At times, the Portfolio  Manager may
         determine that an investment  opportunity  may be appropriate  for only
         some of the accounts for which he exercises investment  responsibility,
         or may decide that  certain of these  accounts  should  take  differing
         positions with respect to a particular  security.  In these cases,  the
         Portfolio  Manager may execute  differing or opposite  transactions for
         one or more accounts  which may affect the market price of the security
         or the execution of the transactions,  or both, to the detriment of one
         or more of his accounts.

     o   Performance Fees. The Portfolio Manager manages other accounts that are
         subject to a performance  allocation or  performance  fee which in some
         cases may be  greater  than the fee  payable  by the Fund.  This  could
         create a conflict  because the Portfolio  Manager may benefit if a more
         attractive  investment  is allocated to an account that bears a greater
         performance allocation or fee.


(A)(3)   COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
         MEMBERS

         Mr.  Sparaggis'  compensation  consists  of periodic  advances  and the
         income from the profits of Alkeon  Capital  Management,  LLC derived by
         him as its sole  principal.  The level of Alkeon  Capital  Management's
         profitability in turn is dependent on the advisory fees and performance
         fees and allocations received from the Fund and other advisory clients.

(A)(4)   DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES OWNERSHIP

            The table  below sets forth  beneficial  ownership  of shares of the
            registrant by the Portfolio Manager as of December 31, 2006.

         "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)))  are effective,  as of a date within
         90 days of the filing date of the report that  includes the  disclosure
         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
         Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
         240.15d-15(b)).

    (b)  There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has  materially
         affected,   or  is  reasonably   likely  to  materially   affect,   the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
      SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES PROMULGATED UNDER
                 SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment companies
set forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Fund;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or the Covered Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts


<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between a Fund
and its investment adviser or a third party service provider of which the
Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the applicable Fund or for its investment adviser or a
third party service provider, or for one or more of them), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationship between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company.

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o   not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
         influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
         whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
         of the Fund;

     o   not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Fund; and

     o   report at least annually his or her affiliations or other relationships
         that could potentially present a conflict of interest with the Fund.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o   each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or
         cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
         within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

     o   each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within
         the Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
         necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
         other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser
         with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
         understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
         the Fund; and

                                      -2-
<PAGE>


     o   each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
         Fund with applicable standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
         laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the
         Fund that the Covered Officer has received, read and understands the
         Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that
         the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

     o   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
         Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations of
         the Code that are made in good faith; and

     o   notify the Compliance Officer of the Fund promptly if the Covered
         Officer knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself
         a violation of this Code.

         The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to
the Fund and counsel to the Managers of the Fund who are not "interested
persons," as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, of the
Fund (the "Independent Managers"), and is encouraged to do so. However, any
approvals or waivers(1) must be considered by the Independent Managers.

         Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any reported potential violations;

     o   if, after such investigation, the Compliance Officer believes that no
         violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
         any further action;

     o   any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
         reported to the Independent Managers;

     o   if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the
         Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
         which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of,
         and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment


- ---------------
(1)  For this purpose, the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the Fund's
     failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been
     made known to Fund management.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         adviser or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to
         dismiss the Covered Officer; and

     o   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are

         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
