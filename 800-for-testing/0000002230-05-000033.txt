1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2005 was $948,934,273 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $325,648,868, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $432,136,900 and $106,488,032, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $91,383,757 and
$102,728,044, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2005 can be
found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2005 were as follows:

and compensation during the last five years of employment. The Company's policy
is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that can be deducted for
federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the Company deems
appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be paid
to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company
contributed $9,422 to the plans. The Company anticipates contributing an
additional $9,422 to the plans in 2005.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic
pension cost for the six months ended June 30, 2005:

</TABLE>

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company expensed
contributions of $88,304. The Company does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. Stock-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") permits the issuance of
stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146
shares of the Company's Common Stock at the fair market value on the date of
grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation rights
is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during
subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less than one year
after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are exercisable beginning
not less than two years after the date of grant. The stock appreciation rights
allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise their options and
receive cash in an amount equal to the difference between the option exercise
price and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of surrender.
All options terminate 10 years from the date of grant if not exercised. With
the adoption of the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan") at
the 2005 Annual Meeting, no further grants will be made under the 1985 Plan,
although unexercised awards granted in 2004 and prior years remain outstanding.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2005, and
changes during the period then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the six months ended June 30, 2005 was ($8,205).

The 2005 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock. Restricted stock was granted to key employees on April 27, 2005
at fair market value on that date, vesting over a three year period. Restricted
stock units were granted to non-employee directors on April 27, 2005 at fair
market value on that date and vest over a one year period. The number of shares
of Common Stock which remain available for future grants under the Plan at
June 30, 2005 is 3,392,440 shares. The Company pays dividends and dividend
equivalents on outstanding awards, which are charged to net assets when paid.
Dividends and dividend equivalents paid on restricted awards that are later
forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted as of June 30, 2005,
and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted under the 2005 Plan are recognized over the relevant service period
based on the fair value of the awards granted. Any unearned compensation is
included in "Undistributed net investment income" and is subsequently expensed
as services are rendered. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the
average of the high and low market price on the date an award is granted. The
total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to employees for the six
months ended June 30, 2005 was $9,728. The total compensation costs for
restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that
may occur during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Company.
At June 30, 2005, the Company had no securities on loan.

                                                                             7

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at June 30, 2005, and the results of
its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for
each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at June 30, 2005, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
