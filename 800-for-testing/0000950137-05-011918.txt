PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an early withdrawal
charge of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to zero
after year five), an early withdrawal charge of 1.00 percent for Class C shares
in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of up to 0.25
percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C shares and a
service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Figures shown above
assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has waived or
reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

Fund Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2005

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team, led
by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser and Christina Jamieson,
Executive Director of the Advisor.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The senior loan market demonstrated continued strength for the 12-month period
ended July 31, 2005. Despite rising oil prices, the pace of economic growth
stayed on track and inflation remained contained. Many corporations posted
earnings announcements that reflected healthy balance sheets and well-executed
strategies. A weakening U.S. dollar further benefited a number of companies
within the senior loan market, including those in the chemical, steel, and
forest product and paper industries. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports more
competitive in foreign markets, while making foreign imports more expensive to
U.S. consumers). Against this backdrop of enhanced profitability, the credit
quality of corporate debt improved and helped to boost the senior loan market.

Companies actively took advantage of this favorable environment and issued a
significant amount of new senior loans during the period. This issuance was more
than met by investor demand, which was strong across both the primary and
secondary markets. Continuing the trends of recent years, improving credit
qualities and significantly lower default rates encouraged increased
participation in the senior loan market, particularly among institutional
investors. The sector's appeal was further enhanced by rising short- and
intermediate-term interest rates, which buoyed the yields of senior loans and
underscored the defensive characteristics of the asset class. (The yields of
senior loans adjust in response to changes in short-term interest rates.)

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 5.18 percent for the 12 months ended July 31, 2005, (Class IB
shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

Seeking to balance attractive yields with a relatively stable net asset value,
we followed a disciplined investment approach which was anchored by our rigorous
fundamental research. Consistent with our long-standing practice, the portfolio
construction process focused upon identifying companies with strong management,
solid and predictable cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of
default. It is our view that the merits of this approach are reflected in the
portfolio's performance for the 12-month period and likely would be further
evidenced during a cyclical downturn.

To help manage overall risk, we diversified the portfolio's assets across both
individual securities and sectors. While individual security selection drives
the investment process, we also carefully weighed broader sectors. As we have
historically, we generally eschewed the debt of cyclical companies, whose
fortunes may be particularly vulnerable to changes in the economy, preferring
instead senior loans from sectors with greater potential stability throughout
the economic cycle.

Accordingly, our investment discipline led us to more-defensive segments of the
market. We favored the defense industry, where long-term demand trends remain
supportive and companies hold considerable hard assets. We emphasized companies
that offer goods and services used on a regular basis, including food, drug and
beverage companies and ecological (waste management) companies. Meanwhile, we
were particularly cautious with automotive debt. Given the ongoing travails of
the auto sector, the outlook for specific automotive manufacturers and their
suppliers remains clouded. We avoided homebuilders due to their extreme
vulnerability to the fortunes of the real estate market; as well as clothing
manufacturers, where overseas competition has increased sharply. We were
similarly circumspect in regard to the telecommunications sector. Here too,
competition has been fierce, dominant technologies have changed rapidly, and
companies tend not to hold significant hard-asset collateral.

While the bulk of the portfolio was invested in senior loans, the fund also
included a small stake in equities, which it held as the result of company
restructurings. During the period, equity exposure contributed some volatility.

As of the close of the reporting period, our analysis suggests continued bright
prospects for the senior loan market, and we look forward to pursuing the most
compelling opportunities. The economy has shown continued signs of growth, and
corporate profits and pricing power have remained largely intact for the
borrowers in the senior loan market. Such factors, in our view, support a
favorable environment for continued free cash flow and our expectation that
credit quality will not weaken significantly. That said, we intend to view with
added caution those companies that are heavily exposed to fuel prices.

There is no guarantee the security sectors mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the fund in the future.

                                                                               3

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 25, 2005, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. Finally, the Board considered materials it had received in
approving a change in the advisory fee rate effective June 1, 2004. The Board of
Trustees considered the contract over a period of several months and the non-
management trustees held sessions both with the investment adviser and separate
from the investment adviser in reviewing and considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
existing and alternative breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee
schedule. The Board of Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund
and other investment companies and/or other products at different asset levels,
and considered the trends in the industry versus historical and projected assets
of the Fund. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the investment
adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the Fund. The
Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of

                                                                               7

factors control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all
factors together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain
matters considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund and changes made
in the Fund's portfolio management team over time. The Fund discloses
information about its portfolio management team members and their experience in
its prospectus. The trustees also discuss certain other services which are
provided on a cost-reimbursement basis by the investment adviser or its
affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including certain accounting, administrative
and legal services. The Board has determined that the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the investment adviser support its decision to
approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, a performance committee of the
Board spends more focused time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in
the Van Kampen complex, paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser the performance goals and the
actual results achieved in managing the Fund. When considering a fund's
performance, the trustees and the investment adviser place emphasis on trends
and longer-term returns (focusing on one-year, three-year and five-year
performance with special attention to three-year performance) and, when a fund's
weighted performance is under the fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and
where necessary seek to make specific changes to investment strategy or
investment personnel. The Fund discloses more information about its performance
elsewhere in this report. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser the
level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to comparable funds and other
products advised by the adviser and others in the marketplace. The trustees
review not only the advisory fees but other fees and expenses (whether paid to
the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The
Fund discloses more information about its fees and expenses in its prospectus.
The Board has determined that the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund
support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put

together by the investment adviser with the oversight of a special ad hoc
committee of the Board. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser its
revenues and expenses, including among other things, revenues for advisory
services, portfolio management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement
costs and allocated expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The Board
has determined that the analysis of the investment adviser's expenses and
profitability support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
and growth prospects of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense
ratio and particularly the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its
review of the investment adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the
investment adviser how more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or
effectiveness of managing the Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee
level is appropriate relative to current and projected asset levels and/or
whether the advisory fee structure reflects economies of scale as asset levels
change. The Board has determined that its review of the actual and potential
economies of scale of the Fund support its decision to approve the investment
advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and it affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

                                                                               9

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

(e) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f) Payment-in-kind security.

(g) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2005.

(h) Non-income producing security as this stock currently does not declare
    dividends.

(i) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 2.4%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. In June 2003, the Fund completed a
transaction in which it redesignated its shares issued before June 13, 2003 as
Class B Shares and issued new Class C Shares to the shareholders of Van Kampen
Senior Floating Rate Fund in exchange for the assets and liabilities of that
fund. Effective February 18, 2005, the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund Class B and
Class C share classes were renamed Class IB and Class IC Shares, respectively.
Also, effective February 18, 2005, the Fund issued new Class A, Class B and
Class C Shares. The Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares are not continuously
offered.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination period and
maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the
period until the next interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such
Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial
paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate
securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the
Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by
the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase

 40

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

agreements, which are short-term investments in which the Fund acquires
ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the security at
a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2005, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $1,027,665,325, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

    At July 31, 2005, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Fund declares daily and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are
distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book
purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary
income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended July 31, 2005
and 2004 was as follows:

<Table>

                                                                 2005           2004

Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income...........................................  $80,556,679    $60,620,611
  Return of Capital.........................................          -0-      5,601,584
                                                              -----------    -----------
                                                              $80,556,679    $66,222,195
                                                              ===========    ===========
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between financial and tax basis reporting for the 2005 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Permanent differences relating to excise taxes paid which are not
deductible for tax purposes totaling $2,136 were reclassified from accumulated
undistributed net investment income to capital. Also, a permanent difference of
$5,179,271 relating to book to tax amortization differences were reclassified
from accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss. Finally, $181,183 relating to book to tax amortization differences were
reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment income to capital.

    As of July 31, 2005, the component of distributable earnings on a tax basis
was as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $2,022,532
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses related to wash sale
transactions post October losses which may not be recognized for tax purposes
until the first day of the following fiscal year, and losses that were
recognized for book purposes but not for tax purposes at the end of the fiscal
year.

F. CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES During the year ended July 31, 2005, the
Fund's custody fee was reduced by $85,506 as a result of credits earned on cash
balances.

Next $500 million...........................................    .800%
Over $3.0 billion...........................................    .775%
</Table>

    In addition, the Fund will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen
Funds Inc., the Fund's Administrator, at an annual rate of .25% of the average
daily net assets of the Fund. The administrative services provided by the
Administrator include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any
agreements with respect to participations and assignments, record keeping
responsibilities with respect to interests in Senior Loans in the Fund's
portfolio and providing certain services to the holders of the Fund's
securities.

    For the year ended July 31, 2005, the Fund recognized expenses of
approximately $839,200 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Fund, of which a Trustee of the Fund
is a partner of such firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as
legal counsel to the Fund.

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO")
Employment agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides
compliance services to the Fund. The costs of these services are allocated to
each Fund. For the year ended July 31, 2005, the Fund recognized expenses of
approximately $166,500, representing Van Kampen Investment Inc.'s or its
affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the
Fund, as well as, the salary, benefits, and related costs of the CCO and related
support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal
Services agreement are reported as part of "Legal" expenses on the Statement of
Operations. Services provided pursuant to the CCO Employment agreement are
reported as part of "Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations.

    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc. (VKIS), an affiliate of the Adviser,
serves as the shareholder servicing agent of the Fund. For the year ended July
31, 2005, the Fund recognized expenses for these services of approximately
$1,708,800 representing transfer agency fees paid to VKIS. Transfer agency fees
are determined through negotiations with the Fund's Board of Trustees.

    Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Van Kampen. The Fund does not compensate its officers or Trustees who are also
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Fund provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
Trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, Trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each Trustee's years of service to the Fund.
The maximum annual benefit per Trustee under the plan is $2,500.

                                                                              43

The Fund has adopted the following fundamental policies in relation to its

periodic repurchase offers ("Repurchase Offers") for the Fund's common shares
pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"); Repurchase Offers will be made at periodic intervals of, initially,
quarterly (the "Periodic Interval"); provided, that the Periodic Interval shall
become one month without any additional action by the Board of Trustees, and
without the requirement of a shareholder vote, upon the Securities and Exchange
Commission granting exemptive relief to the Fund from the provisions of Rule
23c-3 of the 1940 Act; the repurchase request deadline will be the third Friday
of each month (or the preceding business day if such third Friday is not a
business day) in which a Repurchase Offer ends (the "Request Deadline"); and the
repurchase pricing date for a Repurchase Offer shall occur no later than the
fourteenth calendar day after such Repurchase Offer's Request Deadline (or the
next business day after such fourteenth calendar day if the fourteenth calendar
day is not a business day). So long as the Periodic Interval is quarterly, the
Fund's Repurchase Offers will end in the months of January, April, July and
October.

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $147,392,000 as of July 31, 2005. The
Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,007,398 as of July 31, 2005 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2005 continued

the Fund under the revolving credit agreement shall be used for temporary
liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder repurchases. Annual commitment
fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the credit line. For the year
ended July 31, 2005, the Fund recognized commitment fee expenses of
approximately $539,700.

    Borrowings under this facility will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate
plus 1.00%. For the year ended July 31, 2005, when in use, the average daily
balance of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement was $71,034,483 with

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At July 31, 2005, the Fund had no selling participants with respect to
investments in senior loans purchased by the Fund on a participation basis.

Effective February 18, 2005, the Fund has adopted a distribution plan (the
"Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its new Class A Shares, new Class B
Shares and new Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule
12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as
if the Fund were an open-end investment company. The Fund also has adopted a
service plan (the "Service Plan") with respect to each of its new Class A
Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares and Class IC Shares. There is no
Distribution Plan or Service Plan for the Class IB Shares and no Distribution
Plan for the Class IC Shares. All service fees under the Service Plan applicable
to new Class A Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares and Class IC
Shares are currently being waived. For the year ended July 31, 2005, the
Distributor waived service fees of $396,473. This waiver is voluntary in nature
and can be discontinued at any time. Under the Distribution Plan and Service
Plan, the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and
distribution of its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of
ongoing services to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of
shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average
daily net assets of new Class A Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares,
and Class IC Shares respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the
Distributor, the aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%,
0.75%, 0.75%, and 0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for new Class A
Shares, new Class B Shares, new Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares
respectively. Annual fees under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan are
accrued daily. The net annual fees for new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares
are paid monthly. The amount of distribution expenses incurred by Van Kampen and
not yet reimbursed ("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $121,500 and
$248,600 for new Class B Shares and new Class C Shares, respectively. This
amount may be recovered from future payments under the distribution plan. To the
extent the unreimbursed receivable has been fully recovered, any excess fees
will be refunded on a quarterly basis.

    Included in the fees for the year ended July 31, 2005 are payments made to

10. LITIGATION

On September 28, 2001 and October 11, 2001, separate complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois each by a
shareholder of the Fund against the Fund, the Adviser, Van Kampen Funds Inc. and
certain directors and officers of the Fund. The respective complaints, framed as
class actions, allege misstatements and omissions in the Fund's registration
statements in violation of the federal securities laws. The separate complaints
were consolidated on or about December 15, 2001, and the class was certified on
or about August 26, 2002. The consolidated action is entitled Abrams et al. v.
Van Kampen Funds, Inc., et al., No. 01 C 7538 (N.D. Ill., Hart J.). On June 3,
2005, the Court preliminarily approved a pretrial settlement of this class
action in the amount of $31,500,000. A fairness hearing on the settlement has
been scheduled for November 16, 2005. Under the terms of the proposed
settlement, the Fund will not be responsible for the settlement amount.

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              49

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of
Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund"), as of
July 31, 2005, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the
year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of July 31, 2005 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund as of July 31, 2005, the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 2.  Code of Ethics.

(a)     The Fund has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Fund or a
third party.

(b)     No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c)     The Fund has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by the
shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund.":

"Each Covered Officer must not use his personal influence or personal
relationship improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
indirectly)."

Further, due to personnel changes at the Adviser, the list of Covered Officers
set forth in Exhibit B and the General Counsel designee to whom questions about
the application of the Code should be referred in Exhibit C were amended during
the period. Exhibit B was then amended again in March 2005 and a third time in
August 2005. All three editions of Exhibit B are attached.

(d)     Not applicable.

(e)     Not applicable.

(f)
            (1)      The Fund's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit
                     12A.
            (2)      Not applicable.
            (3)      Not applicable.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has one "audit committee
financial expert" serving on its audit committee, "independent" Trustee Rod
Dammeyer. Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an
audit committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee
financial expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties,
obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and
liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board
of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

(e)(1) The audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are as
follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

               AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)


1.       STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

         The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

         The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

         For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider
whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence. The Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent
Auditors are best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient
services, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people,
culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the
service might enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve
audit quality. All such factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor
should necessarily be determinative.

         The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees
for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

         The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax
and All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of
pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different
period and states otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and
pre-approve the services that may be provided by the Independent Auditors
without obtaining specific pre-approval

- -------------------
(1)      This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
         Policy and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above,
         supercedes and replaces all prior versions that may have been
         amended from time to time.
(2)      Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have
         the meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.


<PAGE>



from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

         The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

         The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes
that implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent
Auditors' independence.


2.       DELEGATION

         As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.       AUDIT SERVICES

         The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

         In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the
Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other
Audit services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors
reasonably can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and
services associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,
N-4, etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix
B.1. All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).


4.       AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

         Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in
Appendix B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must
be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the
Audit Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).


5.       TAX SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide
Tax services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the
Covered Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without
impairing the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the
Independent Auditors may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those Tax services that have
historically been provided by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee
has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the Independent
Auditors, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.
The Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in
connection with a transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors,
the sole business purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of
which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
The Audit Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to
determine that the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this
policy.

         Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has
pre-approved the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large
and complex transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be
provided by the Independent Auditors to any executive officer or
trustee/director/managing general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual
capacity, where such services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable
only to internally managed investment companies).


6.       ALL OTHER SERVICES

         The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

         A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.


7.       PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

         Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be
provided by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit
Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require
specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of
the overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

8.       PROCEDURES

         All requests or applications for services to be provided by the
Independent Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must
include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the
list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such
services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to
provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's
Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in
their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

         The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer
to monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors
and to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.


9.       ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

         The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an
annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent
Auditors and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as
reviewing a formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating
all relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.


10.      COVERED ENTITIES

         Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's
investment adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning
with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Fund's audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to
the Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered
Entities would include:


        - Van Kampen Investments Inc.

        - Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.


(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services


<PAGE>


are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting
of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f)    Not applicable.

(g)    See table above.

(h)    The audit committee of the Board of Trustees has considered whether the
provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

(a) The Fund has a separately-designated standing audit committee established in
accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are: David

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Fund's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are
as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.       POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable
investment advisory agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as
authorized by the Board of Directors or Trustees of the MSIM Funds. A MSIM
Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA



<PAGE>

account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the case of an account not
governed by ERISA, the investment management or investment advisory agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which the MSIM Affiliates manage assets, consistent with the objective of
maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain
situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a proxy
voting policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the
client's policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or
regulations or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.


II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that


<PAGE>


arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in
accordance with the following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved
by the Proxy Review Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.
A MSIM Affiliate will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected
security between the record date and the meeting date.



III.     GUIDELINES

A.       CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS.  The following proposals will generally
be voted as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review
Committee.

         i.       General.

         1.       Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
                  following are examples of routine management proposals:


                  o Approval of financial statements, director and auditor
                    reports.

                  o General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

                  o Proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting,
                    except those proposals that relate to the "transaction of
                    such other business which may come before the meeting."

         2.       Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be
                  supported; proposals to establish cumulative voting in the
                  election of directors will not be supported.

         3.       Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent
                  tabulation of voting results will be supported.

         4.       Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman
                  and CEO will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S.
                  companies to have a separate Chairman and CEO will be
                  supported.

         5.       Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items
                  that are clearly related to the regular course of business
                  will be supported.

         6.       Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will
                  be supported.

         7.       Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be
                  supported. However, where management specifically states the
                  reason for requesting an adjournment and the requested
                  adjournment is necessary to permit a proposal that would
                  otherwise be supported under this Policy to be carried out
                  (i.e. an uncontested corporate transaction), the adjournment
                  request will be supported.

         8.       Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management
                  supports a classified board) generally will not be supported.


<PAGE>


         9.       Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are
                  costly to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or
                  expenditures that are of a non-business nature or would
                  provide no pertinent information from the perspective of
                  institutional shareholders generally will not be supported.

         ii.      Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists
and where no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless otherwise
determined by the Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be voted in support of
nominees of management.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:

                  o Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66
                    2/3%) of the company's board members be independent
                    directors.

                  o Proposals requiring that members of the company's
                    compensation, nominating and audit committees be comprised
                    of independent or unaffiliated directors.


         2.       Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a
                  withhold vote will be made in the following circumstances:

                   (a) If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
                       disinterested directors, a withhold vote will be made
                       for interested directors. A director nominee may be
                       deemed to be interested if the nominee has, or any time
                       during the previous five years had, a relationship with
                       the issuer (e.g., investment banker, counsel or other
                       professional service provider, or familial relationship
                       with a senior officer of the issuer) that may impair his
                       or her independence;

                   (b) If a nominee who is interested is standing for election
                       as a member of the company's compensation, nominating or
                       audit committees;


                   (c) A direct conflict exists between the interests of the
                       nominee and the public shareholders;

                   (d) Where the nominees standing for election have not taken
                       action to implement generally accepted governance
                       practices for which there is a "bright line" test. These
                       would include elimination of dead hand or slow hand
                       poison pills, requiring audit, compensation or nominating
                       committees to be composed of independent directors and
                       requiring a majority independent board;

                   (e) A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board
                       meetings within a given year without a reasonable excuse;
                       or

                   (f) A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than
                       six companies (excluding investment companies).

          iii.     Auditors

<PAGE>


         1.       Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification
                  of auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not
                  be supported if the audit fees are excessive. Generally, to
                  determine if audit fees are excessive, a 50% test will be
                  applied for audit fees in excess of $1 million: if audit fees
                  are $1 million or more, non-audit fees should less than 50% of
                  the total fees paid to the auditor. If audit fees are less
                  than $1 million, the fees will be reviewed case by case by the
                  Proxy Review Committee.

         2.       Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
                  shareholders will be supported.

         3.       Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

         iv.      Anti-Takeover Matters



         1.       Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
                  requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
                  proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority
                  shareholder vote to pass or repeal certain provisions will not
                  be supported.

         2.       Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail
                  provisions will be supported, provided that the proposal: (i)
                  defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to large
                  block holders (holders of at least 1% of the outstanding
                  shares and in certain cases, a greater amount, as determined
                  by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all shareholders or
                  not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii) contains
                  no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
                  rights of shareholders.


         3.       Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
                  shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.


B.       CAPITALIZATION CHANGES.  The following proposals generally will be
voted as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review
Committee.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:

                  o Proposals relating to capitalization changes that eliminate
                    other classes of stock and/or eliminate unequal voting
                    rights.

                  o Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes
                    of common stock (or securities convertible into common
                    stock) if: (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is
                    stated; (ii) the number of shares requested is reasonable in
                    relation to the purpose for which authorization is
                    requested; and (iii) the authorization does not exceed 100%
                    of shares currently authorized and at least 30% of the new
                    authorization will be outstanding.

                  o Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
                    issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

                  o Proposals for share repurchase plans.

<PAGE>




                  o Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of
                    common or preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of
                    preferred stock.

                  o Proposals to effect stock splits.

                  o Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
                    proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set
                    forth in the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do
                    not adjust proportionately to the authorized share amount
                    generally will be approved if the resulting increase in
                    authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set
                    forth above for common stock increases.

         2.       The following proposals generally will not be supported
                  (notwithstanding management support).

                  o Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add
                    classes of stock which substantially dilute the voting
                    interests of existing shareholders.

                  o Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of
                    existing classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or
                    supervoting rights.

                  o Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

                  o Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or
                    more.

C.       COMPENSATION.  The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

         1.       The following proposals generally will be supported:

                  o Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts
                    are not excessive relative to other companies in the country
                    or industry.


                  o Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit
                    discounts up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a
                    broad-based employee plan, including all non-executive
                    employees.


                  o Proposals for the establishment of employee stock option
                    plans and other employee ownership plans, provided that our
                    research does not indicate that approval of the plan would
                    be against shareholder interest.


                  o Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
                    severance plans, provided that our research does not
                    indicate that approval of the plan would be against
                    shareholder interest.


2.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
     agreements will not be supported, however, proposals that require
     shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the annual
     compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.



3.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive compensation
     generally will not be supported.

<PAGE>


         4.       Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive
                  compensation in addition to the disclosure required by the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations
                  generally will not be supported.




D.       OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted
as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.



         1.       Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
                  environmental or special interest issues that do not relate
                  directly to the business of the company and which do not
                  appear to be directed specifically to the business or
                  financial interest of the company generally will not be
                  supported.

         2.       Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are
                  not required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals
                  relate will not be supported.

E.       ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.


         I.       CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS

                  o Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other
                    special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs,
                    sales of assets, reorganizations, restructurings and
                    recapitalizations) will be examined on a case-by-case basis.
                    In all cases, Research Providers' research and analysis will
                    be used along with MSIM Affiliates' research and analysis,
                    including, among other things, MSIM internal
                    company-specific knowledge. Proposals for mergers or other
                    significant transactions that are friendly, approved by the
                    Research Providers, and where there is no portfolio manager
                    objection, generally will be supported.

         ii.      Compensation

                  o Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in
                    non-salary compensation plans, employment contracts, and
                    severance agreements that benefit management and would be
                    costly to shareholders if triggered. With respect to
                    proposals related to severance and change of control
                    situations, MSIM Affiliates will support a maximum of three
                    times salary and bonus.

                  o Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option
                    plans. Generally, stock option plans should be incentive
                    based. The Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the
                    quantitative criteria used by a Research Provider when
                    considering such Research Provider's recommendation. If the
                    Proxy Review Committee determines that the criteria used by
                    the Research Provider is reasonable, the proposal will be
                    supported if it falls within a 5% band above the Research
                    Provider's threshold.

                  o Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock
                    options that have not been offered to employees in general.


         iii.     Other

                  o Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

                  o Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring
                    specific levels of stock ownership by directors.

                  o Proposals for election of directors, where a director
                    nominee is related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board of
                    Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management) must
                    be considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the proposal
                    relates to a director nominee who is on a Van Kampen Fund's
                    Board of Directors/Trustees, to the extent that the shares
                    of the relevant company are held by a Van Kampen Fund, the
                    Van Kampen Board shall vote the proxies with respect to
                    those shares, to the extent practicable. In the event that
                    the Committee cannot contact the Van Kampen Board in advance
                    of the shareholder meeting, the Committee will vote such
                    shares pursuant to the Proxy Voting Policy.

                  o Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating
                    to broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

                  o Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
                    indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
                    Committee will support such proposals provided that the
                    officers and directors are eligible for indemnification and
                    liability protection if they have acted in good faith on
                    company business and were found innocent of any civil or
                    criminal charges for duties performed on behalf of the
                    company.


IV.       ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A.       PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

         1.       The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible
                  for creating and implementing the Policy and, in this
                  regard, has expressly adopted it.

                  (a)      The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief
                           Investment Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior
                           investment professionals who represent the different
                           investment disciplines and geographic locations of
                           the firm. The Committee is responsible for
                           establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM
                           will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

                  (b)      The Committee will periodically review and have the
                           authority to amend, as necessary, the Policy and
                           establish and direct voting positions consistent with
                           the Client Proxy Standard.


                  (c)      The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among
                           other matters): (1) address any outstanding issues
                           relating to the Policy and (2) review proposals at
                           upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM portfolio

<PAGE>




                           companies in accordance with this Policy including,
                           as appropriate, the voting results of prior
                           shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a
                           similar proposal was presented to shareholders. The
                           Committee, or its designee, will timely communicate
                           to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments to them
                           and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may
                           adopt).

                  (d)      The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among
                           other matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e.,
                           allowing certain shares of the same issuer that are
                           the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held
                           by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
                           differently than other shares) and/or "override
                           voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a
                           manner contrary to the Policy); (2) review and
                           approve upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters
                           for which specific direction has been provided in
                           this Policy; and (3) determine how to vote matters
                           for which specific direction has not been provided in
                           this Policy. Split votes generally will not be
                           approved within a single Global Investor Group
                           investment team. The Committee may take into account
                           Research Providers' recommendations and research as
                           well as any other relevant information they may
                           request or receive, including portfolio manager
                           and/or analyst research, as applicable. Generally,
                           proxies related to securities held in accounts that
                           are managed pursuant to quantitative, index or
                           index-like strategies ("Index Strategies") will be
                           voted in the same manner as those held in actively
                           managed accounts. Because accounts managed using
                           Index Strategies are passively managed accounts,
                           research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
                           related to securities held in these accounts may not
                           be available. If the affected securities are held
                           only in accounts that are managed pursuant to Index
                           Strategies, and the proxy relates to a matter that is
                           not described in this Policy, the Committee will
                           consider all available information from the Research
                           Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
                           significant, from the portfolio managers and/or
                           analysts.

                  (e)      In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                           Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                           material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                           appearance of a potential material conflict of
                           interest, the Committee will request a special
                           committee to review, and recommend a course of action
                           with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                           ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee shall be
                           comprised of the Chairperson of the Proxy Review
                           Committee, the Compliance Director for the area of
                           the firm involved or his/her designee, a senior
                           portfolio manager (if practicable, one who is a
                           member of the Proxy Review Committee) designated by
                           the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's Chief
                           Investment Officer or his/her designee. The Special
                           Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's
                           General Counsel or his/her designee and will have
                           sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to the
                           research provided by Research Providers, the Special
                           Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate
                           investment professionals and outside sources to the
                           extent it deems appropriate.

<PAGE>


                  (f)      The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will document in writing all of their
                           decisions and actions, which documentation will be
                           maintained by the Committee and the Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of at
                           least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate
                           to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                           investment company, the Committee and Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
                           decisions to each applicable Board of
                           Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at
                           each Board's next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
                           The report will contain information concerning
                           decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee
                           during the most recently ended calendar quarter
                           immediately preceding the Board meeting.

                  (g)      The Committee and Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will timely communicate to applicable
                           portfolio managers, the Compliance Departments and,
                           as necessary, to ISS, decisions of the Committee and
                           Special Committee so that, among other things, ISS
                           will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

B.       IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         1.       If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a material \
                  conflict of interest, the vote must be decided by the Special
                  Committee in consultation with MSIM's General Counsel or
                  his/her designee.

         2.       A material conflict of interest could exist in the following
                  situations, among others:

                  (a) The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an
                      affiliate of MSIM and the vote is on a material matter
                      affecting the issuer;

                  (b) The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any
                      other security issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates;
                      or

                  (c) Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the
                      matter submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial
                      advisor to a party to a merger or acquisition for which
                      Morgan Stanley will be paid a success fee if completed).

C.       PROXY VOTING REPORTS

                  (a) MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any
                      client requesting them. MSIM will also, upon client
                      request, promptly provide a report indicating how each
                      proxy was voted with respect to securities held in that
                      client's account.

                  (b) MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an
                      annual Form N-PX on behalf of each registered management
                      investment company for which such filing is required,
                      indicating how all proxies were voted with respect to such
                      investment company's holdings.

           CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS
                ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003, AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and

<PAGE>


its investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers or
employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in
the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
investment adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Fund and its
investment adviser. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities
is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the investment
adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with the
provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such
activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
recognized by the Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly);

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         o        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

<PAGE>


         o        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;

         o        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         o        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         o        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

- -----------------
(3) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         o        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         o        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         o        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         o        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         o        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or
C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.

<PAGE>

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
      information included in this report, fairly present in all material
      respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
      assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
      include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

      a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

      b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

      c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

      d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.

                          VAN KAMPEN ANNOUNCES CHANGES
                         TO VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND
                                  TENDER OFFER

                                                              September 30, 2005

     Recently, Van Kampen Investments announced enhancements to the Van Kampen
Senior Loan Fund. As part of these product enhancements, effective February 18,
2005, please note that the tender offer period and process have now changed.

     The Fund now makes regular offers to repurchase its shares in order to
provide liquidity to shareholders. The repurchase offer is an opportunity for
shareholders to sell shares on a periodic basis. Previously, the tender offer
had to be approved by the Board of Trustees, and there were no assurances that
the Fund would offer a quarterly tender. Pursuant to the recent modifications,
the Fund now offers a regular quarterly repurchase period. In addition, the Fund
is currently seeking exemptive relief to conduct monthly repurchase offers.
There is no assurance, however, that such exemptive relief will be granted.

     Please note the following changes to this process:

          - The dates for this quarter's Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund repurchase
            offer period are September 30 through the close of the New York
            Stock Exchange (normally the Exchange closes at 4:00 p.m., Eastern
            Time, but may close earlier on certain days) on October 21, 2005 for
            Class A, B, C, IB and IC shares. The Fund is offering to repurchase
            a portion of its outstanding shares at a price equal to the
            respective net asset value per class of common shares of the Fund on
            the repurchase pricing date, as more fully described in the enclosed
            Repurchase Offer Terms.

          - Prior to each repurchase offer period, the Fund will send
            notification to all Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund shareholders,
            including those accountholders whose shares are held in networked
            accounts or omnibus positions. For all repurchase offer periods,
            shareholders will be mailed the following documents no less than 21
            days prior to the repurchase request deadline:

        - A letter outlining the repurchase procedure

        - Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund Shareholder Repurchase Offer Notice

        - Repurchase Offer Terms

        - Letter Of Transmittal

     SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING OR EXCHANGING SHARES CAN
DISREGARD THE PACKET.

          - You may continue to place trades through your back office; please
            follow your internal procedures.

          - Van Kampen sponsored retirement plan shareholders with State Street
            Bank and Trust Company as custodian who wish to sell their shares
            must complete and submit the appropriate Van Kampen retirement
            account distribution form in addition to the enclosed Letter of
            Transmittal. To obtain a distribution form, you may download forms
            at www.vankampen.com.

     For information on recent enhancements to the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund,

To Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund Shareholders:

     As part of recent modifications of the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund, the
Fund now makes regular offers to repurchase its shares in order to provide
liquidity to shareholders. The repurchase offers are an opportunity for you to
sell shares on a periodic basis. Prior to each repurchase offer period, the Fund
now sends notification to all Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund shareholders.

IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING OR EXCHANGING YOUR FUND SHARES AT THIS
TIME, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AND CAN DISREGARD THIS NOTICE.

     If you intend to sell or exchange your shares during this repurchase offer
period, please read the enclosed documents. You should also consider the
following:

          - Determine if your account is held with your financial advisor or
            directly with Van Kampen. If you are unsure if your account is held
            directly with Van Kampen or with your financial advisor, please
            review your most recent account statement. If your statement is from
            your financial advisor, you must contact your financial advisor for
            assistance. If your statement is from Van Kampen, you may either
            contact your financial advisor or you can contact Van Kampen.

          - IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS HELD WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THERE MAY BE
            DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR MAKING A REPURCHASE REQUEST DURING THE
            REPURCHASE OFFER. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR BEFORE
            COMPLETING THESE DOCUMENTS.

          - If you wish to sell shares held in a Van Kampen sponsored retirement
            plan account with State Street Bank and Trust Company serving as
            custodian, you must complete and submit the appropriate Van Kampen
            retirement account distribution form in addition to the enclosed
            Letter of Transmittal to execute your request. To obtain a
            distribution form, please contact our Client Relations Department
            immediately at 1-800-847-2424 or you may download the form at

     The enclosed documents apply only to the current repurchase offer period,
and new documents will be mailed to you in connection with subsequent offers.

Loan Fund Shareholder Repurchase Offer Notice, Repurchase Offer Terms and Letter
of Transmittal if you have any questions.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

                                                                64 SLT00007-9/05

                          VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND
                      SHAREHOLDER REPURCHASE OFFER NOTICE

     This notice is to inform you of the dates for your Fund's next quarterly
repurchase offer. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING YOUR SHARES AT THIS TIME,
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AND CAN DISREGARD THIS NOTICE.

     This is a legally required notification of the scheduled quarterly
repurchase offer. The Fund will contact you again next quarter to remind you of
the next repurchase offer period, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission
permits us to conduct monthly repurchase offers prior to then, in which case we
will contact you at the commencement of the first monthly repurchase offer.

     We extend this quarterly repurchase offer to provide liquidity to
shareholders because shares of this closed-end interval fund are not redeemable
daily for cash and are not traded on a stock exchange. You can sell Fund shares
only during one of the Fund's scheduled quarterly repurchase offer periods, so
we would like to make you aware of the deadlines and procedures should you wish
to do so. NOTE THAT EARLY WITHDRAWAL OF SHARES FROM THE FUND MAY RESULT IN A
SALES CHARGE AND MAY BE A TAXABLE EVENT; consult your financial advisor or tax
advisor for more information. Please remember that you are not obligated to do
anything with your shares at this time.

     This quarter's repurchase offer period begins on September 30, 2005. Please
note, this quarter's repurchase offer ends (unless extended) on the repurchase
request deadline at the close of the New York Stock Exchange (normally the
Exchange closes at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, but may close earlier on certain
days) on October 21, 2005. Shares accepted for repurchase will be purchased at a
price equal to the respective net asset value of such shares on the repurchase
pricing date, which is described further in the enclosed Repurchase Offer Terms.
On September 23, 2005, the net asset values per share of the Fund's Class A,
Class B, Class C, Class IB and Class IC shares were $9.08, $9.08, $9.08, $9.09
and $9.08, respectively.

     If you wish to sell your shares for cash or exchange your shares for shares
of other participating funds during this repurchase offer period, you can do so
in one of three ways as follows:

          1. IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD FOR YOU BY YOUR BROKER-DEALER, OR FOR YOUR
     RETIREMENT PLAN BY YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN TRUSTEE OR OTHERWISE BY A NOMINEE,
     YOU WILL NEED TO ASK YOUR BROKER-DEALER OR RETIREMENT PLAN TRUSTEE OR
     NOMINEE TO SUBMIT THE REPURCHASE REQUEST FOR YOU.

          2. IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD IN YOUR OWN NAME, COMPLETE THE ENCLOSED
     LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND INSURE THAT IT IS RECEIVED IN GOOD ORDER BY VAN
     KAMPEN INVESTOR SERVICES INC., THE FUND'S DEPOSITARY, PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF
     THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NORMALLY THE EXCHANGE CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M.,
     EASTERN TIME, BUT MAY CLOSE EARLIER ON CERTAIN DAYS) ON OCTOBER 21, 2005.
     PLEASE CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE SHARES ARE
     HELD IN YOUR NAME OR IN THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR'S NAME.

          3. IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD IN A VAN KAMPEN SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLAN
     ACCOUNT WITH STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY SERVING AS CUSTODIAN,
     PLEASE BE AWARE THAT VAN KAMPEN REQUIRES A COMPLETED DISTRIBUTION FORM FOR
     YOUR SPECIFIC RETIREMENT ACCOUNT TYPE, IN ADDITION TO THE ENCLOSED LETTER
     OF TRANSMITTAL IN ORDER TO PROCESS YOUR REQUEST. To obtain a distribution
     form, please contact our Client Relations Department immediately at
     1-800-847-2424, or you may download forms at www.vankampen.com.

     IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHICH OF THE ABOVE SITUATIONS APPLIES TO YOU, PLEASE
CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

     ALL DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO REPURCHASE REQUESTS MUST BE RECEIVED IN GOOD
ORDER PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NORMALLY THE EXCHANGE
CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME, BUT MAY CLOSE EARLIER ON CERTAIN DAYS) ON
OCTOBER 21, 2005.

     Please refer to the Fund's Prospectus and the enclosed Repurchase Offer
Terms and Letter of Transmittal if you have any questions, or you can also call
us at 1-800-847-2424 or your financial advisor. The enclosed documents apply
only to the current repurchase offer period, and new documents will be mailed to
you in connection with subsequent offers.

     No person has been authorized to make any recommendation, to give you any
information or to make any representations to you in connection with this
repurchase offer (other than those contained herein, in the Repurchase Offer
Terms, in the Letter of Transmittal, in the letter outlining the repurchase
procedure or in the Fund's Prospectus) and, if given or made, such information
must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Fund, its investment
adviser, its principal underwriter or its transfer agent.

                                                                64SLT004(a)-9/05

                             REPURCHASE OFFER TERMS

     1. THE OFFER. Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is offering to
repurchase for cash up to fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate of its issued
and outstanding Class A, Class B, Class C, Class IB and Class IC shares of
beneficial interest ("Shares") on the repurchase request deadline (described
below) at a price equal to the respective net asset value ("NAV" or "Net Asset
Value") as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the repurchase pricing
date (described below), less any applicable early withdrawal charge (described
below), upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Repurchase Offer Terms,
the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund Shareholder Repurchase Offer Notice (the
"Repurchase Offer Notice"), the Fund's Prospectus, and the related Letter of
Transmittal. Together those documents constitute the "Offer". The purpose of the
Offer is to provide liquidity to shareholders of the Fund. The Offer is not
conditioned upon the tender for repurchase of any minimum number of Shares. All
classes of Shares are considered to be a single class for the purposes of
allocating repurchases under this Offer. The purpose of the Offer is to provide
liquidity to shareholders since the Fund is unaware of any secondary market
which exists for the Shares. The Fund currently does not charge a processing fee
for handling repurchase requests. However, if your Shares are held for you by
your broker-dealer, or for your retirement plan by your retirement plan trustee
or otherwise by a nominee, such person may charge a transaction fee for
submitting a repurchase request for you.

     2. NET ASSET VALUE. You must determine whether to tender Shares prior to
the repurchase request deadline, but the Net Asset Values at which the Fund will
repurchase Shares will not be calculated until the repurchase pricing date. The
Net Asset Values may fluctuate between the date you submit your repurchase
request and the repurchase request deadline (and the repurchase pricing date, if
different.) The Net Asset Values on the repurchase request deadline and the
repurchase pricing date could be higher or lower than on the date you submit a
repurchase request. Please call the Fund at 1-800-847-2424, for current NAV
information.

     3. REPURCHASE REQUEST DEADLINE. All tenders of Shares for repurchase must
be received in proper form by the Fund's transfer agent, Van Kampen Investor
Services Inc., on or before the close of the New York Stock Exchange (normally
the Exchange closes at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, but may close earlier on certain
days) on October 21, 2005, unless extended (the "repurchase request deadline").

     4. REPURCHASE PRICING DATE. The Net Asset Values per share of the Fund's
Class A, Class B, Class C, Class IB and IC Shares for the repurchase must be
determined no later than 14 days after the repurchase request deadline (or the
next business day if the 14th day is not a business day); however, the Fund
intends to determine NAV on the repurchase request deadline, if doing so is not
likely to result in significant dilution of the price of the Shares, or as soon
as such determination can be made thereafter (the "repurchase pricing date"). If
the Fund chooses a repurchase pricing date later than the repurchase request
deadline, there is a risk that the Fund's Net Asset Values per share may
fluctuate between those dates.

     5. PAYMENT FOR SHARES REPURCHASED. Payment for all Shares repurchased
pursuant to this Offer will be made not later than seven days after the
repurchase pricing date.

     6. EARLY WITHDRAWAL CHARGE. The Fund does not currently charge a special
handling or processing fee for repurchases. Your financial adviser or broker may
charge a transaction fee in connection with submitting a repurchase request. An
early withdrawal charge of up to 3% may be imposed on those Class B Shares
accepted for repurchase that have been held for less than five years. An early
withdrawal charge of up to 1% may be imposed on those Class C Shares accepted
for repurchase that have been held for less than 1 year. Also, an early
withdrawal charge of up to 1% may be imposed on certain Class A Shares accepted
for repurchase that have been held for less than 18 months and that were not
subject to a front-end sales load at the time of purchase. Please check your
holdings and the Fund's Prospectus.

     7. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED; PRO RATA REPURCHASE. If
shareholders tender for repurchase more than the Shares which the Fund is
offering to repurchase, the Fund may (but is not obligated to) increase the
number of Shares that the Fund is offering to repurchase by up to 2% of the
number of Shares outstanding on the repurchase request deadline. If the number
of Shares tendered for repurchase thereafter exceeds the number of Shares which
the Fund is offering to repurchase, the Fund is required to repurchase the
Shares tendered on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that the Fund
will be able to repurchase all the Shares that you tender even if you tender all
the Shares that you own. In the event of an oversubscribed Offer, you may be
unable to liquidate some or all of your investment at Net Asset Value. You may
have to wait until a subsequent repurchase offer to tender Shares that the Fund
was unable to repurchase, and you would be subject to the risk of Net Asset
Value fluctuations during that time.

     8. WITHDRAWAL OR MODIFICATION OF NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED. Shares
submitted pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn or you may change the number of
Shares submitted for repurchase at any time prior to the close of the New York
Stock Exchange (normally the Exchange closes at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, but may
close earlier on certain days) on the repurchase request deadline. If your
Shares are held for you by your broker-dealer, or for your retirement plan by
your retirement plan trustee or otherwise by a nominee, please consult such
person if you wish to modify or
<PAGE>

withdraw a repurchase request. With respect to Shares held directly,
shareholders seeking to modify or withdraw their tender of Shares must send to
the Fund's depositary, Van Kampen Investor Services Inc., at the address noted
in the Letter of Transmittal, a notice of withdrawal or notice of modification,
as applicable, that specifies the name of the person withdrawing or modifying a
tender of Shares, the number of Shares to be withdrawn or the modified number of
Shares to be tendered and, if certificates representing such Shares have been
delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, the name of the registered
holder(s) of such Shares. If certificates have been delivered to the depositary,
then, prior to the release of such certificates, you must also submit the
certificate numbers shown on the particular certificates evidencing such Shares,
and the signature on the notice of withdrawal or notice of modification must be
guaranteed. (See Instruction 4(f) to the Letter of Transmittal for further
instructions regarding acceptable guarantees of signatures.) Shares properly
withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the
Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be retendered by following the procedures
described herein prior to the repurchase request deadline. For further
information regarding modifications or withdrawals of tenders, you may call the
Fund at 1-800-847-2424, or contact your financial adviser.

     9. SUSPENSION OR POSTPONEMENT OF REPURCHASE OFFER. The Board of Trustees of
the Fund may suspend or postpone this Offer only by a majority vote of the
Trustees (including a majority of the disinterested Trustees) and only:

          (A) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange or any
     market in which the securities owned by the Fund are principally traded is
     closed, other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which
     trading in such market is restricted; or

          (B) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of
     which disposal by the Fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably
     practicable, or during which it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund
     fairly to determine the value of its net assets; or

          (C) if the Offer would cause the Fund to lose its status as a
     regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
     Code; or

          (D) for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission
     may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the Fund.

     If the Offer is suspended or postponed, the Fund will provide notice to
each shareholder of the Fund's Shares of the suspension or postponement. If the
Fund renews the Offer, the Fund will send a new notification to each shareholder
with details concerning the terms and conditions of the renewed Offer.

     NEITHER THE FUND NOR ITS BOARD OF TRUSTEES MAKES ANY RECOMMENDATION TO ANY
SHAREHOLDER AS TO WHETHER TO TENDER OR REFRAIN FROM TENDERING SHARES. EACH
SHAREHOLDER MUST MAKE AN INDEPENDENT DECISION WHETHER TO TENDER SHARES AND, IF
SO, HOW MANY SHARES TO TENDER. NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY
RECOMMENDATION ON BEHALF OF THE FUND AS TO WHETHER SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD TENDER
SHARES PURSUANT TO THIS OFFER. NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY
INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER OTHER
THAN THOSE CONTAINED HEREIN, IN THE REPURCHASE OFFER NOTICE, IN THE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL, IN THE LETTER OUTLINING THE REPURCHASE PROCEDURE OR IN THE FUND'S
PROSPECTUS.

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to the Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (formerly
known as Van Kampen Prime Rate Income Trust), a non-diversified, closed-end
management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust (the
"Fund"), the common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share,
which are offered in five classes of shares designated as Class A Shares, Class
B Shares, Class C Shares, Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares (collectively, the
"Shares"), of the Fund described below in Box No. 1, at a price (the "Purchase
Price") equal to the respective net asset value per class of Shares ("NAV")
determined as of the repurchase pricing date (as described in the Repurchase
Offer Terms), upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Van Kampen Senior
Loan Fund Shareholder Repurchase Offer Notice and the Repurchase Offer Terms,
each dated September 30, 2005, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in
this Letter of Transmittal and the Instructions hereto (which together
constitute the "Offer"). An early withdrawal charge (as described in the
Repurchase Offer Terms) will be imposed on most Class B Shares and Class C
Shares accepted for payment which have been held for less than five years and
one year, respectively and upon certain Class A Shares which have been held for
less than 18 months and which were not subject to a front-end sales load at the
time of purchase.

     Subject to and effective upon acceptance for payment of the Shares tendered
hereby in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells,
assigns and transfers to or upon the order of the Fund all right, title and
interest in and to all Shares tendered hereby that are purchased pursuant to the
Offer and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Van Kampen Investor
Services Inc. (the "Depositary") as attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with
respect to such Shares, with full power of substitution (such power of attorney
being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to: (a)
deliver certificates for such Shares or transfer ownership of such Shares on the
Fund's books, together in either such case with all accompanying evidences of
transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of the Fund, upon receipt by the
Depositary, as the undersigned's agent, of the respective NAV per class of
Shares with respect to such Shares; (b) present certificates for such Shares, if
any, for cancellation and transfer on the Fund's books; (c) deduct from the
Purchase Price deposited with the Depositary any applicable early withdrawal
charge and remit such charge to Van Kampen Funds Inc.; and (d) receive all
benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such
Shares, subject to the next paragraph, all in accordance with the terms of the
Offer.
<PAGE>

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that: (a) the undersigned
has a "net long position" in the Shares tendered hereby within the meaning of
Rule 14e-4 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, and has
full power and authority to validly tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares
tendered hereby; (b) when and to the extent the Fund accepts the Shares for
purchase, the Fund will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title to them,
free and clear of all security interests, liens, charges, encumbrances,
conditional sales agreements or other obligations relating to their sale or
transfer, and not subject to any adverse claim; (c) on request, the undersigned
will execute and deliver any additional documents the Depositary or the Fund
deems necessary or desirable to complete the assignment, transfer and purchase
of the Shares tendered hereby; and (d) the undersigned has read and agrees to
all of the terms of this Offer.

     The names and addresses of the registered owners should be printed, if they
are not already printed, in Box 1 as they appear on the registration of the
Shares. The tendering shareholder must select the "Cash" option to have the cash
proceeds from the tendered Shares paid in cash or select the "Exchange" option
to have the Depositary invest the cash proceeds of the Offer in shares of the
same class, in the case of Class A Shares, Class B Shares or Class C Shares of
the Fund, or invest the cash proceeds of the Offer in Class A Shares, in the
case of Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares of the Fund, in each case of certain
investment companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management and distributed by
Van Kampen Funds Inc., subject to certain limitations. The tendering shareholder
must further indicate one of several options, either (A) to specify all Shares
be tendered, (B) a specified number of Shares be tendered or (C) that number of
Shares tendered necessary to obtain a specific dollar amount. If the Shares
tendered hereby are in certificate form, the certificates representing such
Shares must be returned together with this Letter of Transmittal.

     The undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in
the Offer, the Fund may terminate or amend the Offer or may not be required to
purchase any of the Shares tendered hereby. In any such event, the undersigned
understands that certificate(s) for any Shares not purchased, if any, will be
returned to the undersigned at the address indicated below in Box No. 1 unless
otherwise indicated under the Special Payment and Delivery Instructions in Box
No. 2.

     The undersigned understands that acceptance of Shares by the Fund for
payment will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and the Fund
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

     The check for the Purchase Price of the tendered Shares purchased, minus
any applicable early withdrawal charge, will be issued to the order of the
undersigned and mailed to the address indicated below in Box No. 1, unless
otherwise indicated in Box No. 2. Shareholders tendering Shares remain entitled
to receive dividends declared on such shares up to the settlement date of the
Offer. The Fund will not pay interest on the Purchase Price under any
circumstances.

     All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned and all obligations of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors
and assigns of the undersigned. Except as stated in the Offer, this tender is
irrevocable.

     THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS TO BE USED ONLY IF THE SHARES TO BE TENDERED

 1. CASH: I understand that an early withdrawal charge will be imposed on most
 Class B Shares and Class C Shares accepted for payment that have been held for
 less than five years and one year, respectively, and upon certain Class A
 Shares which have been held for less than 18 months and which were not subject
 to a front-end sales load at the time of purchase, and that such charge, if
 any, will be deducted from the proceeds from the tender of such Shares.
 OPTION A: ____ (ALL) I hereby tender ALL of my Shares of the Fund.

 OPTION C: ____ (DOLLARS) I hereby tender that number of Shares of the Fund
 necessary to receive $____________ from the Fund after the early withdrawal

 PLEASE NOTE:
 1. A TENDER REQUEST THAT DOES NOT SPECIFY CASH OR EXCHANGE OR THAT DOES NOT
    SPECIFY ALL, A NUMBER OF SHARES OR AN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WILL BE REJECTED.
 2. Alterations to this form (i.e. the repurchase request deadline or share
    class, etc.) are prohibited and the request will be rejected.
 3. Additional legal documentation may be required.
 4. For shareholders electing the "Exchange" option, in order to use certain
    shareholder services (including certain purchase, redemption and exchange
    privileges) on the share account, a signature guarantee form will be
    required for such account; shareholders may access materials to establish
    these privileges by calling the Client Relations Department at (800)
    847-2424 or accessing applicable forms at http://www.vankampen.com by
    selecting the Literature section and then Forms.
 5. If the account indicated by the account number in Box No. 1 is a Van Kampen
    retirement plan custodial account (sponsored by Van Kampen Funds Inc.) of
    which State Street Bank and Trust Company serves as custodian, a Van Kampen
    distribution form MUST be submitted with this Letter of Transmittal.
 6. If the social security number or other tax identification number is not
    certified OR the account is being transferred to a new social security
    number or other tax identification number, a Form W-9 MUST be completed and
    signed by the account owner. (Estate accounts must be signed by the legal
    representative of the estate and bear the estate's tax identification
    number and not the social security number of the deceased. Completion of
    the Form W-9 certifies the tax identification number. Certification will
    prevent backup withholding pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and
    applicable Treasury regulations.) See Instruction 8. Non-U.S. shareholders
    should provide an appropriate Form W-8 to avoid withholding pursuant to the
    Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. See Instruction
    9.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS
             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

     1. DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND CERTIFICATES. This Letter of
Transmittal is to be used only if the Shares to be tendered are registered in
the shareholder's name and the necessary documents will be transmitted to the
Depositary by the shareholder or his broker, dealer or other selling group
member. Do not use this form if a broker, dealer or other selling group member
is the registered owner of the Shares and is effecting the transaction for the
shareholder. A PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR
MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE OF IT, ANY CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING SHARES TENDERED
AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL SHOULD BE MAILED
OR DELIVERED TO THE DEPOSITARY AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL AND MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY ON OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF
THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NORMALLY THE EXCHANGE CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M., EASTERN
TIME, BUT MAY CLOSE EARLIER ON CERTAIN DAYS) ON THE REPURCHASE REQUEST DEADLINE
(OCTOBER 21, 2005, UNLESS EXTENDED).

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF ALL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES,
IS AT THE ELECTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING SHAREHOLDER. IF DELIVERY IS BY
MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS
RECOMMENDED.

     THE FUND WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY ALTERNATIVE, CONDITIONAL OR CONTINGENT
TENDERS. ALL TENDERING SHAREHOLDERS, BY EXECUTION OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
(OR A MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE OF IT), WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY NOTICE OF
THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR TENDER.

     2. COMPLETING THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.  If you intend to tender any
Shares pursuant to the Offer, please complete the Letter of Transmittal as
follows:

          (a) Read the Letter of Transmittal in its entirety. By signing the
     Letter of Transmittal in Box No. 3, you agree to its terms.

          (b) Complete Box No. 1 by providing your Social Security Number/Tax
     Identification Number, a Confirm Number, if applicable, and selecting
     either "Cash" or "Exchange" and selecting and completing Option A, Option B
     or Option C.

          (c) Complete Box No. 2 if certificates for Shares not tendered or not
     purchased and/or any check issued in the name of a person other than the
     signer of the Letter of Transmittal are to be sent or wired to someone
     other than such signer or to the signer at an address other than that shown
     in Box No. 1.

          (d) Complete Box No. 3 in accordance with Instruction 4 set forth
     below.

     3. PARTIAL TENDERS, UNPURCHASED SHARES AND EXCHANGES. If fewer than all of
the Shares evidenced by any certificate submitted are to be tendered and if any
tendered Shares are purchased, new Shares evidenced by your old certificate(s)
will be issued and sent to the registered owner, unless otherwise specified in
Box No. 2 of the Letter of Transmittal, as soon as practicable after the
repurchase request deadline of the Offer.

     Tendering shareholders who elect to have the Depositary invest the cash
proceeds from the tender of Shares of the Fund in shares of the same class, in
the case of Class A Shares, Class B Shares of Class C Shares of the Fund, or in
Class A Shares, in the case of Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares of the Fund,
in each case of certain investment companies advised by Van Kampen Asset
Management and distributed by Van Kampen Funds Inc. should select "Exchange" and
select and complete Option A, B or C. The early withdrawal charge will be waived
for Shares tendered for reinvestment pursuant to this election; however, such
shares immediately become subject to a contingent deferred sales charge schedule
equivalent to the early withdrawal charge schedule of the Fund.

     4. SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, AUTHORIZATIONS AND ENDORSEMENTS.

          (a) If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered owner(s)
     of the Shares tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond exactly
     with the name(s) in which the Shares are registered.

          (b) If the Shares are held of record by two or more joint owners, each
     such owner must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

          (c) If any tendered Shares are registered in different names, it will
     be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of
     Transmittal (or manually signed facsimiles of it) as there are different
     registrations of Shares.

          (d) When this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered
     owner(s) of the Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of
     any certificate(s) representing such Shares or separate authorizations are
     required. If, however, payment is to be made to a person other than the
     registered owner(s), any unpurchased Shares are to be registered in the
     name of any person other than the registered owner(s) or any unpurchased
     Shares are to be issued to a person other than the registered owner(s),
     then the Letter of Transmittal and, if applicable, the certificate(s)
     transmitted hereby, must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate
     authorizations, in either case signed exactly as such name(s) appear on the
     registration of the Shares and on the face of the certificate(s) and such
     endorsements or authorizations must be guaranteed by an institution
     described in Box No. 3.

          (e) If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or
     authorizations are signed by trustees, executors, administrators,
     guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others acting in
     a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate
     when signing and must submit proper evidence satisfactory to the Fund of
     their authority so to act. Please contact the Client Relations Department
     for assistance at (800) 847-2424.
<PAGE>

          (f) Your signature MUST be guaranteed and you MUST complete the
     signature guarantee in Box No. 3 if (i) the value of the Shares tendered
     herewith pursuant to the Offer is greater than $100,000, (ii) this Letter
     of Transmittal is signed by someone other than the registered holder of the
     Shares tendered herewith or (iii) you request payment for the Shares
     tendered herewith to be sent to a payee other than the registered owner of
     such Shares and/or to an address other than the registered address of the
     registered owner of the Shares. An acceptable guarantee is one made by a
     bank or trust company; a broker-dealer; a credit union; a national
     securities exchange, registered securities association or clearing agency;
     a savings and loan association; or a federal savings bank. The guarantee
     must state the words "Signature Guaranteed" along with the name of the
     guarantor institution. Shareholders should verify with the institution that
     it is an eligible guarantor prior to signing. A signature guarantee may not
     be obtained from a notary public.

     5. TRANSFER TAXES. The Fund will pay all share transfer taxes, if any,
payable on the transfer to it of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer. If,
however, (a) payment of the Purchase Price is to be made to any person other
than the registered owner(s), (b) (in the circumstances permitted by the Offer)
unpurchased Shares are to be registered in the name(s) of any person other than
the registered owner(s) or (c) tendered certificates are registered in the
name(s) of any person other than the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal, then the amount of any transfer taxes (whether imposed on the
registered owner(s) or such other persons) payable on account of the transfer to
such person(s) will be deducted from the Purchase Price by the Depositary unless
satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is
submitted.

     6. IRREGULARITIES. All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance of any tender of Shares will be
determined by the Fund in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be
final and binding on all parties. The Fund reserves the absolute right to reject
any or all tenders determined by it not to be in appropriate form or the
acceptance of or payment for any Shares which may, in the opinion of the Fund's
counsel, be unlawful. The Fund also reserves the absolute right to waive any of
the conditions of the Offer or any defect or irregularity in tender of any
particular Shares or any particular shareholder, and the Fund's interpretations
of the terms and conditions of the Offer (including these Instructions) will be
final and binding on all parties. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities
in connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the Fund shall
determine. Tendered Shares will not be accepted for payment unless all defects
and irregularities have either been cured within such time or waived by the
Fund. None of the Fund, Van Kampen Funds Inc., the Depositary or any other
person shall be obligated to give notice of defects or irregularities in
tenders, nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give any such
notice.

     7. QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL COPIES. Questions
and requests for assistance may be directed to, and additional copies of the
Offer and this Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from, Van Kampen Funds
Inc., 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181-5555, or by
telephoning (800) 847-2424.

     8. BACKUP WITHHOLDING; FORM W-9. Each tendering shareholder who is a United
States person (including a resident alien individual) and who has not already
submitted a completed and signed Form W-9 to the Fund is required to provide the
Depositary with a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") on Form W-9
which is enclosed herewith. Failure to furnish a properly completed Form W-9 to
the Depositary may subject the tendering shareholder to backup federal income
tax withholding on the payments made to the shareholder or other payee with
respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer.

     9. WITHHOLDING ON NON-U.S. SHAREHOLDERS. The Depositary will withhold
federal income taxes equal to 30% of the gross payments payable to a non-U.S.
shareholder unless the non-U.S. shareholder has provided to the Depositary an
appropriate Form W-8 on which it claims eligibility for a reduced rate of
withholding or establishes an exemption from withholding. For this purpose, a
non-U.S. shareholder is any shareholder that is not (i) a citizen or resident of
the United States, (ii) a corporation or partnership created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless
of its source or (iv) a trust whose administration is subject to the primary
jurisdiction of a United States court and which has one or more United States
fiduciaries who have authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust. The Depositary will determine a shareholder's status as a non-U.S.
shareholder and eligibility for a reduced rate of, or an exemption from,
withholding by reference to certificates or statements provided by the non-U.S.
shareholder concerning eligibility for a reduced rate of, or exemption from,
withholding unless facts and circumstances indicate that reliance is not
warranted. A non-U.S. shareholder who has not previously submitted the
appropriate certificates or statements with respect to a reduced rate of, or an
exemption from, withholding for which such shareholder may be eligible should
consider doing so in order to avoid overwithholding. A non-U.S. shareholder may
be eligible to obtain a refund of tax withheld if such shareholder is able to
establish that no tax or a reduced amount of tax was due.

     IMPORTANT: THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR A MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE OF IT
(TOGETHER WITH ANY CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS)
MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK
EXCHANGE (NORMALLY THE EXCHANGE CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME, BUT MAY CLOSE
EARLIER ON CERTAIN DAYS) ON THE REPURCHASE REQUEST DEADLINE.

                                                                  64 SLT005-9/05
