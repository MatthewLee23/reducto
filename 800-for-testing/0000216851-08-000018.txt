Investment income dividends and capital gains distributions are taken in
additional shares. This chart covers the years 1993-2007. Fees for the
reinvestment of interim dividends are assumed as 2% of the amount reinvested
(maximum of $2.50) and commissions of $0.05 per share. There is no charge for
reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions or the sale of any shares. These results should not be considered
representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which may be
realized in the future.

We are pleased to report another outstanding year for Petroleum & Resources
Corporation. The Fund realized a total return on net assets of 31% for the
year, nearly twice that of 2006 and only slightly below the 33% increase in the
Dow Jones Oil and Gas Index (DJOGI). The 80% of the portfolio which is
comprised of energy stocks (not including utilities) returned over 35% for the
year. The utility segment of the portfolio, mostly gas pipelines and
distribution companies, also had a strong year, with a 22% return, well ahead
of the utility sector of the S&P 500 Index, which returned 19%. Our non-energy
holdings (primarily chemicals) returned approximately 15%, well ahead of the
broader S&P 500 Index return of 5.5% for the year. Below, we summarize events
driving our performance in 2007 and our perspective on energy markets in 2008.

A REVIEW OF 2007
Oil prices fluctuated in a range of $50-$60 per barrel for most of the first
quarter as a relatively mild winter kept a lid on heating oil demand in this
country and the OPEC
production cut of late 2006 stabilized inventory levels. Modest growth in
general economic activity here and abroad also served to slow the growth in
worldwide demand for crude oil. Late in the quarter, however, a number of
factors pushed the price of oil upward. Economic activity picked up. Gasoline
demand jumped as the driving season kicked off. The slide of the dollar
relative to other currencies picked up speed. OPEC production cuts resulted in
declining inventories worldwide, and the U.S. troop surge in Iraq began. In
addition, speculative interest in oil futures contracts, already significant,
grew larger. The net result was that the oil price rose steadily to $70 a
barrel by the end of the second quarter and oil stocks had one of their best
quarters ever, with the DJOGI up over 14%. The runup continued through the end
of the year, with the price of oil touching $98 a barrel in late December.
Stocks did not follow suit, however, as the U.S. economy showed signs of
weakening and concerns arose about refining margins and demand both here and
overseas.

2007 was not as exciting for natural gas as it was for oil. The mild winter
weather mentioned earlier resulted in less gas being taken out of storage than
normal and a higher level of storage going into the spring. While demand from
gas-fired power plants was good during the warm summer, strong domestic
production growth and increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports kept prices
in the $6-$8 per thousand cubic feet range for most of the year. Natural gas in
storage was at record levels going into this winter, but the colder weather has
resulted in larger drawdowns than in the prior winter. While plenty of gas
remains, the level of demand has pushed prices up since the change in season to
$8 per thousand cubic feet and above.

Coal has been in significant oversupply for some period of time, though
speculative interests drove the price up when a series of new coal-fired power
plant construction projects were announced early in the year. Many of these
were subsequently cancelled and prices fell back. Numerous smaller mines have
closed due to increased costs of operations and safety mandates, but there is
still excess production capacity for thermal coal in the U.S. Even so, steam
coal experienced a surge in prices late in the year due to improved
international demand. Until some competitive form of clean-coal technology can
be developed, the pollution associated with coal burning will constrain demand
growth. Producers of metallurgical coal for steelmaking fared somewhat better
in 2007 as steel demand was strong and Australian producers of such coal had
difficulty exporting their production due to shipping bottlenecks.

The energy sector had a very strong year in 2007, buoyed by rising prices
throughout the period. The best-performing group within the DJOGI was the
exploration and production group, which was up by 43% for the year. Our
holdings, led by Noble Energy and Apache Corp., rose 44% due to their strong
production growth and drilling programs. The oil service segment had the second
best increase of the year, with that portion of the DJOGI up 41%, partially due
to consolidation in the rig companies and other service providers. The Fund's
service names were up by 30% as GlobalSantaFe was bought out by Transocean,
Weatherford was up 64% and Schlumberger, our largest holding in the service
segment, rose 56%.

The difference between the Fund's return and that of the service segment of the
DJOGI can largely be attributed to National Oilwell and Smith International,
the fourth and eighth largest companies in the group, neither of which were
held by the Fund. On the other hand, the performance of the Fund's integrated
companies was very strong, with our investments up 28%, led by Hess, up 103%,
and Murphy, which was up 67% on the ramp-up of production

at the Kikeh field off Malaysia. The DJOGI integrated companies, in contrast,
were up 26%. The index-beating return came despite our holdings in Royal Dutch
Shell and Total, which are not represented in the index and did not perform as
well as the rest of the group in 2007. As noted above, our utility holdings,
mostly gas distribution companies and pipeline operators, did very well, with a
22% return. Within the DJOGI, the gas pipelines returned 14% and the
distribution companies returned 4%, while the broader S&P Utility sector
returned 19%.

INVESTMENT RESULTS
Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2007 were $978,919,829 or $42.99
per share on 22,768,250 shares outstanding. This compares with $812,047,239 or
$36.61 per share on 22,180,867 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2007 was $10,070,758 compared to $9,844,108 for 2006.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.46 and $0.47 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our 0.54%
expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a low level
compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $82,692,239 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $462,398,019 at
December 31, 2006 to $606,901,290 at year end.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Total dividends and distributions paid in 2007 were $4.31 per share compared to
$3.80 in 2006. The table on page 19 shows the history of our dividends and
distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual rate of
distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Corporation's Common Stock. In 2007, the annual rate of distribution was 11.61%
compared to 11.26% in 2006. As announced on November 8, 2007, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.20 per share and capital
gains of $3.72 per share was made on December 27, 2007, both realized and
taxable in 2007. On January 10, 2008, an additional distribution of $0.13 per
share was declared to shareholders of record February 14, 2008, payable
March 1, 2008, representing undistributed net investment income earned in 2007
and an initial distribution from 2008 net investment income, taxable to
shareholders in 2008.

OUTLOOK FOR 2008
Though the oil price briefly touched $100 per barrel early in January, it has
subsequently retreated to below $90 as crude inventories rose more than
anticipated on lower refinery runs. Price volatility is expected to continue to
be high as supplies remain tight and demand depends greatly on world economic
growth. Any impact on supply, whether from the U.S. urging the Saudis for more
oil, unrest in Nigeria, a further decline in the relative value of the dollar,
or a host of other geopolitical reasons, will be reflected in the price almost
instantly. Estimates of the portion of the price representing non-economic
factors, including speculative interests, range from $20 to $40 per barrel.
These are unlikely to go away any time soon, so we expect to see a wide price
range of $75 to $100 per barrel, with possible spikes up or down beyond that
range. This makes it difficult to generate reliable earnings estimates for the
oil companies. With an expected range of oil prices greater than the 2007
average of $72.23, however, we expect that the companies will show earnings
growth in the 5-7% range. This is likely to be somewhat better than the average
growth of companies in the S&P 500 Index. With the current valuations of energy
companies at the low end of their ranges, we think the oils can outperform the
market again in 2008.

The outlook for natural gas is increasingly a function of the weather, both hot
and cold. With demand by industrial users shrinking, power generation and home
heating have become the primary users of natural gas. Demand growth over the
longer term, however, is likely to be more a function of the better
environmental characteristics of the fuel. On the supply side, many of the new
wells coming on stream, largely from more complex geologies, have slower
depletion rates after the first year of production than older wells, and result
in gradually improved supply levels. LNG imports are a modest swing factor, but
are still a very small part of the available supply in this country. Our
expectation is that the growth in demand over time will be increasingly
difficult to satisfy and prices will gradually rise, making the exploration and
production companies an attractive area for investment.

A recession in this country of any length or depth, with repercussions
overseas, would bring demand down sufficiently to take oil prices lower than
the $75 to $100 range and adversely impact earnings. The stocks would then
probably not perform as well as the market. Regardless of what happens in the
short term, the outlook for the energy

industry over the longer term is good. The world will need oil and natural gas
for many years to come, regardless of technical advances and legislation in
favor of alternative fuels. Our broad exposure to the many segments of the
industry provides stockholders with a stable platform for investment in this
complex sector as well as an attractive cash flow.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On December 13, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation over the
ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the restriction that shares
can only be repurchased when the discount of the market price of the shares
from the net asset value is 6.5% or greater.

From the beginning of 2008 through January 25, 2008, 30,000 shares have been
repurchased at a total cost of $1,015,147 and a weighted average discount from
net asset value of 11.4%.

                           -------------------------

At its meeting in December, the Board of Directors promoted Robert E. Sullivan
to the position of Executive Vice President, effective January 1, 2008. As
such, he becomes a member of the Investment Committee and an integral part of
the portfolio management team for the Fund. In his three and a half years at
the Fund, he has demonstrated strong stock selection skills and a thorough
knowledge of the energy industry.

We are pleased to announce that Mr. Kenneth J. Dale was appointed to the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, effective January 10, 2008. Mr. Dale is Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of The Associated Press. Prior to
joining the AP he was an investment banker for J. P. Morgan & Company, Inc.,
advising clients on capital structure, equity offerings, debt issuances, and
mergers and acquisitions activity. His extensive investment background combined
with his global perspective make him a valuable addition to the Board of
Directors.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation is an internally-managed fund emphasizing petroleum and other
natural resource investments. The investment objectives of the Corporation are
preservation of capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments,
and an opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national securities
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2007 was $412,244,883, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $606,810,906, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $609,881,682 and $3,070,776, respectively.
As of December 31, 2007, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,506,701
of undistributed ordinary income and $1,110,098 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2007
were classified as ordinary income of $11,559,594 and capital gain of
$81,989,740. In comparison, distributions paid by the Corporation during the
year ended December 31, 2006 were classified as ordinary income of $17,053,276
and capital gain of $62,529,943. The distributions are determined in accordance
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the
Corporation's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations.

Effective June 29, 2007, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, a clarification of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 establishes financial reporting rules regarding recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The
adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Corporation's net assets or results of
operations.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee of management
and recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $63,058,310 and
$120,120,407, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the market risk of
an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written
option. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31,
2007 can be found on page 17.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:

5. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
covers all employees with at least one year of service. In addition, the
Corporation has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan which
provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Corporation uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

In 2008, the Corporation estimates that $35,904 of prior service cost and
$232,159 of net losses, for a total of $268,063, will be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost.

Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are:

Equity securities include common stock of The Adams Express Company, the
Corporation's non-controlled affiliate, in the amount of $241,170 (5% of total
plan assets) and $236,906 (5% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

The primary objective of the Corporation's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a diversified
portfolio of stocks and fixed income securities.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Corporation contributed
$331,208 to the plans in 2007 and anticipates contributions of approximately
$230,000 in 2008.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Corporation expensed contributions to this
plan of $105,301 and $97,787 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December
31, 2006, respectively. The Corporation does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Corporation during subsequent
years. All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years
from date of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2007, and
changes during the period then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $655,474.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based
restricted stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of
a specified three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned
contingent on achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are
not achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are
forfeited and become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based
restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three year period and
nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors)
vest over a one year period. It is the current intention that employee grants
will be performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in
the event of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to
defer a portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be
paid by delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards were granted at
fair market value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which
remain available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2007 is
830,520 shares.

                                                                             11

         23,182 performance-based awards and

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $288,123.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $114,537. As of
December 31, 2007, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of
$411,802, a component of additional capital surplus, related to nonvested
equity-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs
are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.48 years. The
total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006 was $194,677 and $196,956.

7. OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2007 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,520,806, of which $284,491 was paid as
fees to directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable
income to the Corporation's officers and directors and therefore differ from
the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are
recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

8. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues to receive interest
or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had securities on loan
of $35,852,590, and held collateral of $37,129,937, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

9. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("FAS 157"), which provides enhanced guidance
for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard requires
companies to provide expanded information about the assets and liabilities
measured at fair value and the potential effect of these fair valuations on an
entity's financial performance. The standard does not expand the use of fair
value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair
valuation methods and applications. Adoption of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. Application of the standard is not
expected to materially impact the Corporation's financial statements.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(the "Corporation") at December 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management; our responsibility is to
express an opin
ion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 22.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Corporation presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a)
three interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1 and
(b) a "year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the
estimated balance of the net investment income for the year and the net
realized capital gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to
receive the year-end distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this
distribution, all stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement
notice and an election card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
elections by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  6. Schedule of Investments - This schedule is included
as  part of the report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of
this form.

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the company's management, under the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

     (a)   (1)  Douglas  G. Ober, Chairman, Chief  Executive
     Officer,  and President, and Joseph M. Truta, Executive
     Vice   President,  comprised  the  2  person  portfolio
     management team for the Registrant in 2007.  Robert  E.
     Sullivan,  Executive Vice President, was added  to  the
     portfolio  management team effective January  1,  2008.
     Mr.  Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  have  served  as  portfolio
     managers   for   the  Registrant  since   1991.    This
     information  is as of February 19, 2008.  Mr.  Ober  is
     the  lead member of the portfolio management team.  Mr.
     Ober,  Mr.  Truta  and Mr. Sullivan receive  investment
     recommendations  from a team of research  analysts  and
     make decisions jointly about any equity transactions in
     the  portfolio.  Concurrence of the portfolio  managers
     is  required  for  an investment recommendation  to  be
     approved.

     (2)  Mr. Ober and Mr. Truta also comprise the portfolio
     management   team   for   Registrant's   non-controlled
     affiliate,   The  Adams  Express  Company  (Adams),   a
     registered investment company with total net assets  of
     $1,378,479,527 as of December 31, 2007.   Mr.  Ober  is
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adams  and  Mr.
     Truta is President.  This information is as of February
     19, 2008.  The Petroleum fund is a non-diversified fund
     focusing  on  the energy and natural resources  sectors
     and Adams is a diversified fund with a different focus,
     and  there are few material conflicts of interest  that
     may  arise in connection with these portfolio managers'
     management of both funds.  The funds do not buy or sell
     securities or other portfolio holdings to or  from  the
     other,  and  procedures  and  policies  are  in   place
     covering the sharing of expenses and the allocation  of
     investment opportunities, including bunched orders  and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

     (3)   The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
     three-component plan, consisting of salary, annual cash
     incentive    compensation,   and    equity    incentive
     compensation.  The value of each component in any  year
     is  determined by the Compensation Committee, comprised
     solely of independent director members of the Board  of
     Directors.    Salaries   are   determined   by    using
     appropriate industry surveys and information about  the
     local  market as well as general inflation  statistics.
     Cash  incentive compensation is based on a  combination
     of  absolute and relative fund performance over one and
     three  year  periods as well as individual  success  at
     meeting  goals  and  objectives set  by  the  Board  of
     Directors  at  the  beginning  of  each  year.   Target
     incentives are set based on 80% of salary for the Chief
     Executive  Officer and 60% of salary for the  Executive
     Vice President.  Two-thirds of each individual's annual
     cash  incentive  is based on fund performance  and  one
     third  on  individual success.  The  portion  based  on
     performance  is determined using a scale in  which  the
     target   can   be  earned  by  absolute  fund   pre-tax
     performance of 10%.  The scale ranges from zero to 125%
     of  target.  The result is then modified by an  average
     of  the  one  and three year performance  of  the  fund
     relative  to  that of the Dow Jones Oil and  Gas  Index
     (DJOGI) and the S&P 500 Index, with 80% based upon  the
     relative performance of the fund compared to the  DJOGI
     and  20% based on the relative performance compared  to
     the  S&P  500.   Each  one  percent  outperformance  or
     underperformance by the fund adds or  deducts  5%  from
     the  percentage of target earned based  on  the  scale.
     The maximum percentage of target which may be earned is
     200%  and  the  minimum   is  zero.   Equity  incentive
     compensation, based on a plan approved by  shareholders
     in 2005, can take several forms.  Following approval of
     the  plan, grants of restricted stock were made to  the
     portfolio  managers in January 2006,  with  vesting  in
     equal  proportions over a three year period.  The  size
     of  the  grants  was  determined  by  the  Compensation
     Committee   with   the   assistance   of   an   outside
     compensation  consultant.  Grants of  restricted  stock
     were  also  made on January 11, 2007, and  January  12,
     2006, each of which will vest at the end of three years
     thereafter, but only upon the achievement of  specified
     performance criteria.  For the 2007 grants, the  target
     number  of  restricted shares will vest on January  11,
     2010,  if, on January 1, 2010, the Corporation's  total
     three  year  net  asset value ("NAV") return  meets  or
     exceeds   the  three  year  total  NAV  return   of   a
     hypothetical  portfolio comprised of a 80/20  blend  of
     the  Dow  Jones Oil & Gas Index and the S&P  500  Index
     ("Hypothetical Portfolio"), with a lesser percentage or
     no  shares being earned if the Corporation's total  NAV
     return  trails  that  of  the  Hypothetical  Portfolio,
     depending  on  the  level of underperformance  on  that
     date.   In  addition,  if,  on  January  1,  2010,  the
     Corporation's three year total NAV return exceeds  that
     of  the Hypothetical Portfolio, an additional number of
     shares will be earned and vest, depending on the  level
     of  outperformance.   For the 2006 grants,  the  target
     number  of  restricted shares will vest at the  end  of
     three  years, with certain percentages of shares  being
     deemed   to   have  been  earned  based  on   achieving
     performance  goals  over  specified  intervening   time
     periods.   Only  52.1% of the first-one  sixth  of  the
     target number of shares was earned on January 1,  2007,
     because  the  Corporation's one year total  NAV  return
     trailed  that  of  the Hypothetical Portfolio  on  that
     date.   The  next  one-third of the  target  number  of
     shares  were  earned on January 1,  2008,  because  the
     Corporation's  two year total NAV return exceeded  that
     of  the  Hypothetical  Portfolio  on  that  date.   The
     remaining  50% of the target number of shares  will  be
     deemed to have been earned if, on January 1, 2009,  the
     Corporation's  three  year total NAV  return  meets  or
     exceeds  that  of  the Hypothetical Portfolio,  with  a
     lesser  percentage  or no shares being  earned  if  the
     Corporation's  total  NAV return  trails  that  of  the
     Hypothetical  Portfolio,  depending  on  the  level  of
     underperformance.   In  addition,  as  with  the   2007
     grants,  additional shares will be earned and  vest  if
     the Corporation's three year total NAV exceeds that  of
     the  Hypothetical Portfolio, depending on the level  of
     outperformance  on  that date.  Dividends  and  capital
     gains  paid on the Corporation's shares of Common Stock
     ("dividends") will be paid on all of the target  number
     of  shares of restricted stock, when such dividends are
     paid on  the Common Stock, except that no dividends  or
     capital  gains  will  be paid on any  shares  that  are
     forfeited due to the failure to achieve the performance
     criteria  described  above.  The  basis  for  the  cash
     incentive    and    equity    incentive    compensation
     determinations for Adams is the same as for  Petroleum,
     except  that  the  portion of the cash incentive  based
     upon  fund performance uses the S&P  500 Index  as  the
     benchmark, over a one and three year  period,  and  the
     benchmark  used to measure fund performance for  equity
     incentive  compensation  is a  hypothetical   portfolio
     comprised of a 50/50 blend of the S&P 500 Index and the
     Lipper Large Cap Core Mutual Fund Average.  All of  the
     above information is as of December 31, 2007, except as
     noted.

     (4)  Using  a valuation date of December 31, 2007,  Mr.
     Ober  beneficially owns equity securities in Registrant
     of over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
     securities in Registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  Registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the Registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 28, 2008, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  Registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  Registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the Registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  28, 2008, the Registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  Registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
Registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
Registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See Registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the Registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.
