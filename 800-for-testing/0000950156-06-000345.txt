LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders,
It has been said that change is the only constant in life. As investors have
seen, that theme is still accurate today as we recently have experienced
shifting economic cycles because of natural disasters and political
instability around the globe.

Markets worldwide have fluctuated in the past year as devastating hurricanes
had a dramatic effect on the international economy, particularly on oil
prices. We witnessed political unrest in the Middle East, highlighted by
instability in Iraq, and in Africa, the usually stable Nigeria also
experienced violence. As a result, energy prices have bounced up and down,
with crude oil prices at one point topping a record $70 per barrel.

Such cycles are not uncommon and in fact have almost become the norm in our
everyday lives. What does all of this mean to you as an investor? In times like
these, it helps to know that you're working with a seasoned investment
professional who has experience to guide you through difficult times. At
MFS(R), we believe our investment management team has the knowledge and
confidence to navigate through difficult cycles and at the same time see
through adversity to find investment opportunities for our clients and
shareholders.

Our investment management process, honed over 80 years, combines a unique
concept of teamwork with our unwavering focus on the long term. We firmly
believe that the best way to realize long-term financial goals - be it a
college education, a comfortable retirement, or a secure family legacy - is to
follow a three-pronged approach that focuses on longer time horizons. Allocate
holdings across the major asset classes - including stocks, bonds, and cash.
Diversify within each class to take advantage of different market segments and
investing styles. Rebalance assets regularly to maintain a desired asset
allocation. Of course, these strategies cannot guarantee a profit or protect
against a loss. This long-term approach requires diligence and patience, two
traits that in our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many
opportunities the financial markets can offer - through both up and down
economic cycles.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

    July 17, 2006

              Average Short Term Credit Quality            A-1
              ------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond price is likely to fluctuate with
    general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a fund with a
    5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this graphical presentation, the bond component includes
    both accrued interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any
    derivative holdings, if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which
    have been pre- refunded to an earlier date or which have a mandatory put
    date prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown takes into
    account these earlier dates.
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based
    on the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a
    security which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is
    considered Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency
    mortgage-backed securities, if any, are included in a "AAA"-rating
    category. Percentages are based on the total market value of investments as
    of 5/31/06.

Percentages are based on net assets as of 5/31/06, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed, and current holdings may be different.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers U.S. Government/Mortgage Bond Index - measures debt issued
by the U.S. Government as well as mortgage-backed pass-through securities of
Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset
value underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive
less than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As
a result, the total returns that are calculated based on the net asset value
and New York Stock Exchange prices can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes
as a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her
shares and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be
treated as gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of
shareholder capital have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and may
increase the trust's expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio's yield and share prices change daily based on the credit
quality of its investments and changes in interest rates. In general, the
value of debt securities will decline when interest rates rise and will
increase when interest rates fall. Debt securities with longer maturity dates
will be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter
maturities. Mortgage securities are subject to prepayment risk which can offer
less potential for gains in a declining interest rate environment and greater
potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment. Derivatives involve
risks different from, and potentially greater than, those of the underlying
indicator's in whose value the derivative is based. The value of the
derivative can move in unexpected ways and result in unanticipated losses and
increased volatility if the value of the underlying indicator(s) does not move
in the direction or the extent anticipated. Interest payments on inflation
adjusted debt instruments can be unpredictable and vary based on the level of
inflation. The value of floating rate loans depends on the credit quality and
adequacy of the collateral securing the loan. Enforcing rights against the
collateral may be difficult or insufficient if the borrower of the floating
rate loan defaults. Foreign investments can be more volatile than U.S.
investments. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the portfolio's net
asset value, the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses
realized on the sale of securities. Investing in emerging markets can involve
risks in addition to those generally associated with investing in more
developed foreign markets. When you sell your shares, they may be worth more
or less than the amount you paid for them.

These risks may increase share price volatility.


In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
trust can invest in foreign securities, including securities of emerging
market issuers. Investments in foreign securities are vulnerable to the
effects of changes in the relative values of the local currency and the U.S.
dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's legal, political, and
economic environment. The markets of emerging markets countries are generally
more volatile than the markets of developed countries with more mature
economies. All of the risks of investing in foreign securities previously
described are heightened when investing in emerging markets countries.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Values of debt
instruments obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied
valuations and electronic data processing techniques, which take into account
factors such as institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities,
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other market data. Short-term instruments with a maturity at issuance of
397 days or less are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value. Futures contracts are generally valued at last posted settlement
price as reported by an independent pricing service on the market on which
they are primarily traded. Futures contracts for which there were no trades
that day for a particular position are generally valued at the closing bid
quotation as reported by an independent pricing service on the market on which
they are primarily traded. Forward foreign currency contracts are generally
valued at the mean of bid and asked prices for the time period interpolated
from rates reported by an independent pricing service for proximate time
periods. Securities and other assets generally valued on the basis of
information from an independent pricing service may also be valued at a
broker-dealer bid quotation. The values of foreign securities and other assets
and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars
using the mean of bid and asked prices for rates reported by an independent
pricing service. The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility
for determining or causing to be determined the value of the trust's
investments (including any fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to
valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board. If the adviser
determines that reliable market quotations are not readily available,
investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the
adviser in accordance with such procedures under the oversight of the Board of
Trustees. Under the trust's valuation policies and procedures, market
quotations are not considered to be readily available for many types of debt
instruments. These investments are generally valued at fair value based on
information from independent pricing services. The adviser may rely on
independent pricing services or other information (such as the correlation
with price movements of similar securities in the same or other markets; the
type, cost and investment characteristics of the security; the business and
financial condition of the issuer; and trading and other market data) to
assist in determining whether to fair value and at what value to fair value an
investment. The value of an investment for purposes of calculating the trust's
net asset value can differ depending on the source and method used to
determine value. When fair valuation is used, the value of investments used to
determine the trust's net asset value may differ from quoted or published
prices for the same investments.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust
requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be
transferred to the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to
obtain those securities in the event of a default under the repurchase
agreement. The trust monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral
to ensure that its value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts
owed to the trust under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with
other affiliated entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS),
may utilize a joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or
more repurchase agreements.

INFLATION-ADJUSTED DEBT SECURITIES - The trust invests in inflation-adjusted
debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The trust may also invest in
inflation-adjusted debt securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and
instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury and by other entities such as
U.S. and foreign corporations and foreign governments. The principal value of
these debt securities is adjusted by references to changes in the Consumer
Price Index or another general price or wage index. These debt securities
typically pay a fixed rate of interest, but this fixed rate is applied to the
inflation-adjusted principal amount. The principal paid at maturity of the debt
security is typically equal to the inflation-adjusted principal amount, or the
security's original par value, whichever is greater. Other types of
inflation-adjusted securities may use other methods to adjust for other
measures of inflation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of
both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from
derivative instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's
original cost. Derivative instruments include forward foreign currency
exchange contracts and futures contracts.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes
as unrealized gains or losses by the trust. Upon entering into such contracts,
the trust bears the risk of interest or exchange rates or securities prices
moving unexpectedly, in which case, the trust may not achieve the anticipated
benefits of the futures contracts and may realize a loss.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the
value of the contract. The trust may enter into forward foreign currency
exchange contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes.
For hedging purposes, the trust may enter into contracts to deliver or receive
foreign currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment
activities. The trust may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect
foreign currency denominated securities from declines in value due to
unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the trust may
enter into contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the
trust's portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of
anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are
adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains
or losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On
contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains
or losses on foreign currency transactions.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All discount is
accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax
regulations.

The trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements involving its
portfolio holdings. Any proceeds received are reflected in realized gain/loss
in the Statement of Operations, or in unrealized gain/loss if the security is
still held by the trust.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount, for the six months ended May 31, 2006, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code, and to distribute all of its taxable income, including realized
capital gains. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is required in
the financial statements. Foreign taxes, if any, have been accrued by the
trust in the accompanying financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically adjusted
for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character. These
adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share.
Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of income,
expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess of
net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and
tax purposes.

Book/tax differences primarily relate to amortization and accretion of debt
securities, wash sale loss deferrals, straddle loss deferrals, foreign
currency transactions, and derivative transactions.

The tax character of distributions made during the current period will be
determined at fiscal year end. The tax character of distributions declared to
shareholders is as follows:

                                     NOVEMBER 30, 2005  NOVEMBER 30, 2004
      Ordinary income (including any
      short-term capital gains)            $16,936,571        $17,946,379

The federal tax cost and the tax basis components of distributable earnings
were as follows:

          AS OF MAY 31, 2006

          Cost of investments                           $382,079,279

          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)    $(15,918,517)

          AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2005

          Undistributed ordinary income                    2,880,349
          Capital loss carryforwards                     (21,219,412)
          Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)      (8,755,619)
          Other temporary differences                       (753,251)

The aggregate cost above includes prior fiscal year end tax adjustments.

As of November 30, 2005, the trust had available capital loss carryforwards to
offset future realized gains. Such losses expire as follows:

              November 30, 2007                     $(11,594,208)
              November 30, 2008                       (5,988,179)
              November 30, 2012                       (3,637,025)
              --------------------------------------------------
                                                    $(21,219,412)

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with MFS
to provide overall investment advisory and administrative services, and
general office facilities. The management fee is computed daily and paid
monthly at an annual rate of 0.32% of the trust's average daily net assets and
5.33% of gross investment income. MFS has agreed to temporarily reduce its
management fee to the lesser of the contractual management fee as set forth
above or 0.85% of the average daily net assets. The management fee, from net
assets and gross investment income, incurred for the six months ended
May 31, 2006 was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.62% of the
trust's average daily net assets.

TRANSFER AGENT - The trust pays a portion of transfer agent and dividend-
disbursing costs to MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of MFS. MFSC receives a fee from the trust, for its services as registrar and
dividend-disbursing agent. The agreement provides that the trust will pay MFSC
an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a dividend services fee
of $0.75 per reinvestment. For the six months ended
May 31, 2006, these fees amounted to $48,640. MFSC also receives payment from
the trust for out-of-pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the trust. For
the six months ended May 31, 2006, these costs amounted to $22,847.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement, the funds may partially reimburse MFS the costs incurred to provide
these services, subject to review and approval by the Board of Trustees. Each
fund is charged a fixed amount plus a fee based on calendar year average net
assets. From July 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006, the trust's annual fixed
amount was $10,000. Effective April 1, 2006, the trust's annual fixed amount
is $17,500.

The administrative services fee incurred for the six months ended May 31, 2006
was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.0152% of the trust's average
daily net assets.

TRUSTEES' AND OFFICERS' COMPENSATION - The trust pays compensation to
Independent Trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and
additional compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The trust does
not pay compensation directly to Trustees or to officers of the trust who are
also officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for
their services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the
trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFSC. The trust has an unfunded,
defined benefit plan for certain retired Independent Trustees which resulted
in a pension expense of $7,396. The trust also has an unfunded retirement
benefit deferral plan for certain Independent Trustees which resulted in an
expense of $380. Both amounts are included in Independent trustees'
compensation for the six months ended May 31, 2006. The deferred liability for
retirement benefits payable to certain Trustees under both plans amounted to
$170,593 at May 31, 2006, and is included in payable for independent trustees'
compensation.

DEFERRED TRUSTEE COMPENSATION - Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan)
Independent Trustees previously were allowed to elect to defer receipt of all
or a portion of their annual compensation. Trustees are no longer allowed to
defer compensation under the Plan. Amounts previously deferred are treated as
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the trust or
other MFS funds selected by the Trustee. Deferred amounts represent an
unsecured obligation of the trust until distributed in accordance with the
Plan. Included in other assets and payable for independent trustees'
compensation is $11,839 of Deferred Trustees' Compensation.

OTHER - This trust and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement. For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the fee paid to Tarantino
LLC was $1,513. MFS has agreed to reimburse the trust for a portion of the
payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC in the amount of $1,295, which is
shown as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.
Additionally, MFS has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office
space, other administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO.

committed line of credit, is allocated among the participating funds at the
end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee allocated to the trust for

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of May 31, 2006, and the related statement of operations,
changes in net assets, and financial highlights for the six-month period ended
May 31, 2006. These interim financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended November 30, 2005, and financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period ended November 30, 2005, and in our
report dated January 23, 2006, we expressed an unqualified opinion on such
statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights.

GENERAL. Information regarding the portfolio managers of the MFS Government
Markets Income Trust (the "Fund") provided as of May 31, 2006 is set forth
below.

                                                          TITLE AND FIVE YEAR
     PORTFOLIO MANAGER      PRIMARY ROLE       SINCE             HISTORY
     -----------------      ------------       -----      --------------------
Geoffrey L. Schechter     Portfolio Manager    April    Senior Vice President of
                                               2006     MFS; employed in the
                                                        investment management
                                                        area of MFS since 1993.

COMPENSATION. Portfolio manager total cash compensation as of May 31, 2006 is a
combination of base salary and performance bonus:

    o Base Salary - Base salary represents a relatively smaller percentage of
      portfolio manager total cash compensation (generally below 33%) than
      incentive compensation.

    o Performance Bonus - Generally, incentive compensation represents a
      majority of portfolio manager total cash compensation. The performance
      bonus is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors,
      with more weight given to the former (generally over 60%) and less weight
      given to the latter.

        => The quantitative portion is based on pre-tax performance of all of
          the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the
          Fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a
          one-, three- and five-year period relative to the appropriate Lipper
          peer group universe and/or one or more benchmark indices with respect
          to each account. The primary weight is given to portfolio performance
          over a three-year time period with lesser consideration given to
          portfolio performance over one- and five-year periods (adjusted as
          appropriate if the portfolio manager has served for shorter periods).

        => The qualitative portion is based on the results of an annual
          internal peer review process (conducted by other portfolio managers,
          analysts and traders) and management's assessment of overall
          portfolio manager contributions to the investment process (distinct
          from portfolio performance).

Portfolio managers also typically benefit from the opportunity to participate
in the MFS Equity Plan. Equity interests in MFS or its parent company are
awarded by management, on a discretionary basis, taking into account tenure at
MFS, contribution to the investment process and other factors.

Finally, portfolio managers are provided with a benefits package including a
defined contribution plan, health coverage and other insurance, which are
available to other employees of MFS on substantially similar terms. The
percentage of compensation provided by these benefits depends upon the length
of the individual's tenure at MFS and salary level as well as other factors.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The following table shows the dollar range of equity
securities of the Fund beneficially owned by the Fund's portfolio manager as of
the Fund's semi-annual period ended May 31, 2006. The following dollar ranges
apply:

         N. None
         A. $1 - $10,000

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MFS seek to identify potential conflicts of
interest resulting from a portfolio manager's management of both the Fund and
other accounts and has adopted policies and procedures designed to address such
potential conflicts.

In certain instances there may be securities which are suitable for the Fund's
portfolio as well as for accounts with similar investment objectives of the
Adviser or subsidiary of the Adviser. Securities transactions for the Fund and
other accounts with similar investment objectives are generally executed on the
same day, or the next day. Nevertheless, it may develop that a particular
security is bought or sold for only one client even though it might be held by,
or bought or sold for, other clients. Likewise, a particular security may be
bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling that
same security.

When two or more clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of
the same security, the securities are allocated among clients in a manner
believed by MFS to be fair and equitable to each. It is recognized that in some
cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Fund is concerned. In most cases, however, MFS believes
that the Fund's ability to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions for the Fund.

MFS does not receive a performance fee for its management of the Fund. MFS
and/or a portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate favorable or
limited opportunity investments or structure the timing of investments to favor
accounts other than the Fund--for instance, those that pay a higher advisory
fee and/or have a performance fee.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase Fund shares
annually. The notification to shareholders of the program is included in the
semi-annual and annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs
begin on March 1st of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule
10b-18 of the securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of
Fund shares that may be repurchased in each annual period (March 1 through the
following February 28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the
first day of the plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of Fund shares
available for repurchase for the March 1, 2006 plan year are 5,191,476.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrant's
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of
    the filing date of this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal financial
    officer and principal executive officer have concluded that those
    disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the
    material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on this
    report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
    forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit.

    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title
    18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification
    will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under
    the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
    the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference: Attached hereto.
