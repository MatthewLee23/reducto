                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2006
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2006, the Fund had a total return of 6.48%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2006, the Fund had an average annual total return of
7.88%.(1)

The returns of the managers in our arbitrage fund generally ranged from low to
high single digits, a much narrower range than in 2004 that may reflect the
continued low volatility environment. Fixed income arbitrage managers fared
better on average than those in the event-driven category, while our
short-biased credit managers earned middling returns while helping to reduce
risk in the portfolio.

Event-driven managers had an uneven year. Compelling opportunities in merger
arbitrage continue to be limited and the strategy still occupies a small
percentage of these managers' assets, although the average exposure has risen
somewhat from 15% in 2004 to about 25% currently. Despite merger volume of $2.7
trillion worldwide in 2005, the highest level since 2000, overall spread levels
widened only modestly compared to short term rates. Furthermore, high levels of
cash on corporate balance sheets, low interest rates, and the flood of private
equity capital meant that more deals were for cash rather than share exchanges.
Our managers have preferred to focus on large and/or complex transactions that
feature more attractive spreads, but in the process have been forced to
concentrate their investments more than in years past. Elsewhere in event-driven
portfolios, distressed allocations generally performed steadily over the course
of the year, though some did experience short-term bumps around the General
Motors downgrade in April. Event-oriented long/short equity strategies did well
for these managers, though short books caused some pain towards year-end.

                                   (Unaudited)

U.S. convertibles never became a compelling opportunity in 2005. Having
recovered from the tumult of the first half of the year, the current pricing
offers limited potential and supply seems unlikely to increase significantly.
Issuers are either flush or have access to cheaper capital elsewhere in the
markets. Given the disappointment of recent years, there is still a risk more
capital will leave this space. However, one bright note worth highlighting in
this category is an Asian convertible bond fund we added to the portfolio in
late 2004. We believed that volatility would pick up in Asian markets,
particularly in Japan. After suffering through some down months, the fund surged
to double digit gains as realized volatility in Japan increased from 22.4% in Q1
2005 to 32.7% in Q4. The diversification of this fund's long volatility exposure
to Taiwan, Korea, and India should keep it competitive in the long-term.

Fixed income arbitrage opportunities were scattered in niches throughout the
credit markets in 2005. Some dislocation in the forward yield curve offered our
managers ways in which to eek out returns. The growth of the credit default swap
market - estimated to be fivefold over the last two years - has created more
flexibility in implementing profitable capital structure arbitrage trades,
particularly in emerging markets. The "slicing and dicing" of credit risk into
structured products also presented residual opportunities, but most were not
high return propositions.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2006

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want to or be able to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must estimate the value of the claims he is buying, the
likely timing and resolution of the bankruptcy process and also may be called
upon to reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2006, the Fund had a total return of 8.46%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2006, the Fund had an average annual total return of
13.43%.(1)

More buoyant equity markets and a drop in volatility benefited our distressed
managers in the second half of what was otherwise a relatively tepid year. After
a turbulent October that included five defaults, investors' appetite for risk
reappeared. Dovish Federal Open Market Committee minutes in the wake of what
were seen as easing inflationary pressures helped comfort investors.

Credit spreads and default rates are currently at historically low levels, but
the large amount of high yield issuance and notable relaxation of underwriting
standards should create significant opportunities when the credit cycle turns.
The downgrade of General Motors' debt to below investment grade concurrent with
Kirk Kerkorian's tender for General Motors equity temporarily caused some
commotion in the high yield markets in the late spring, but thus far turmoil has
been largely isolated to the auto sector. Later in the year, the bankruptcies of
Delphi, Delta, Refco and Calpine were also headline-making events, but overall
ratings actions were not severe. Despite our surprise that the weakness was
contained, the tight spreads and low level of defaults appear to be at or near a
cyclical trough.

Tight spreads continue to be supported by leveraged credit players, exemplified
by the burgeoning European Collateralized Debt Obligation ("CDO") market.
However, delays in rating changes and tamed inflationary fears have helped build
investor indifference toward the risks in the system. For example, 638 European
CDOs and 156 North American CDOs had exposure to Delphi bonds, but S&P only
downgraded 127.

Once multiple losses accrue in a CDO's collateral pool, though, the probability
of the tranches being downgraded increases. Broad-based asset exposure to such
troubled companies poses significant risk to additional credit jolts, but
spreads have proven remarkably resilient thus far.

It is our experience that the weakness we have seen in the auto sector will not
remain contained. The fundamentals of the high yield market appear to be
weakening, which will pressure spreads to widen and increase near-term risks in
the distressed market. On the calendar year, high yield mutual funds witnessed
approximately $11.8 billion in outflows, almost three times the 2004 total.
Supply, in the meantime has reappeared; the new issue calendar caught a second
wind in November and December, and priced over $10 billion in each month.
Currently, distressed managers are finding a reasonable number of opportunities
but are defensively positioned as they await a more favorable environment.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2006
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2006, the Fund had a total return of 11.66%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2006, the Fund had an average annual total return of
7.93%.(1)

Performance for our long/short managers was generally strong across the board as
the equity markets rewarded - to a greater degree than 2004 at least - the
stock-picking skills of most of our managers. Though volatility sunk even lower,
the dispersion of sector returns increased significantly and inflationary trends
showed signs of testing corporate earnings. Slight volatility spikes and
increased dispersion followed any signs that earnings difficulties might be a
trend. Naturally, our managers with exposure to energy or utilities benefited
from broad sector rallies, but success was not limited to sector allocation.
Several generated meaningful returns in financials, healthcare and technology
despite lackluster overall performance in those industries. A primary factor in
this kind of success is a longer-term investment horizon in a market
increasingly dominated by investors' need for immediate results.

Despite a global bull market in equities, the U.S. stock market lagged, with S&P
delivering its lowest return (4.9%) in three years. The indices moved within a
relatively narrow range, shrugging off the hurricanes, the sharp rise in energy
prices and the Federal Reserve rate hikes. Value investors, in particular,
struggled. The historical outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks in
recent years has resulted in a dramatic narrowing of the valuation spreads
between the two groups. In terms of price/earnings and price/sales, the
valuations of value stocks are close to being at their most expensive level
ever. Value investors are finding that traditional value screens are not
generating nearly enough long ideas. The value-oriented investors in our Fund
have found success in 2005 by using a broader fundamental toolkit that involves
deep industry expertise and an understanding of return drivers, rather than
reflexive application of traditional value-based metrics.

Though the bulk of our long/short returns were generated in the U.S., the
addition of international exposure at the end of 2004 also benefited the
portfolio. Asian stock markets such as Korea, Japan, and India rose greater than
40% on the year while in Europe stocks hit three-year highs. Though the
magnitude of the Asian rally is eye-opening, the bullishness followed
significant Gross Domestic Product growth, reform measures, and attractively
priced assets across the region.

                       For the year ended January 31, 2006
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
capital among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market
neutral strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund contains managers that attempt to create long and short portfolios that
are roughly equal in size and therefore immune to overall stock markets
movements. Often these strategies are quantitative in nature, using computer
screens to pick long and short portfolios of stocks and balancing their risk
exposure through optimization techniques.

For the year ended January 31, 2006, the Fund had a total return of 4.19%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2006, the Fund had an average annual total return of
2.61%.(1)

Earlier in 2005, a temporary return to value-based factors coupled with spikes
in volatility boosted the equity-based strategies in this portfolio. However, in
the third and fourth quarters, a slew of positive macroeconomic data and healthy
earnings reports lifted overall equity markets, but disproportionately benefited
growth and lower quality stocks. The Russell 3000 Growth index, which
underperformed the Russell 3000 Value index for five of the first six months,
outperformed in the last two quarters. For our equity managers in this
portfolio, this development created losses in the short portfolios which are
heavily slanted towards "junkier" growth stocks.

The currency and tactical asset allocation managers in this portfolio generated
the bulk of the positive returns in the fiscal year. Among those strategies that
performed were currency positions, Latin American equity exposures, and
commodities. A long position in the Brazilian Real represented a consistently
profitable position for several of our managers as the currency posted a 12%
gain on the year. It was the Real's third straight annual gain and the largest
increase against the dollar of the 16 major currencies. Our managers' models
still indicate further upside in the currency. In other areas of our
quantitative portfolios, momentum models yielded little in way of returns and
tactical stock selection worked intermittently.

The Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of opportunistic
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
smaller-sized, more idiosyncratic portfolios employing directional strategies or
focusing on particular markets or sectors.

From the commencement of operations on May 27, 2005 through the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2006, the Fund had a total return of 4.94%.(1)

We have been pleased so far with the idiosyncratic nature of the higher
concentration positions and the robust portfolio construction represented in the
Fund. Though the returns are less meaningful as the portfolio is maturing, it
has already demonstrated a tendency to generate positive results with low
correlation to the overall market, i.e. positive returns in two out of three
down months for the S&P 500 since its August launch.

One of our largest and best performing positions this fiscal year was in a
long/short Asia manager whose background includes over fifteen years of
Japan-focused hedge fund investing. While maintaining a relatively low net
exposure to a runaway Nikkei, the strategy has enjoyed significant success.
However, we feel that the strategy is positioned for greater gains as the
initial euphoria subsides, and rising global and Japanese interest rates lead to
more divergent and fundamentally based performance in stocks.

In recent months, we added two fund exposures to our current portfolio
composition with an international manager and a quantitatively-based tactical
strategy. The international exposure will comprise of thematic concentrated
investments across industrial, real estate, and telecom sectors in Japan and
Western Europe. The quantitatively-based tactical bet seeks to exploit the
valuation dichotomy between high quality and low quality stocks, favoring large
capitalization U.S. companies with high economic profit, low leverage, and low
earnings volatility.

These new positions should provide an attractive risk-adjusted return over a
longer-term investment horizon. They complement our bullish sector specialists
such as our energy fund and should provide a healthy dose of downside market
protection for the overall portfolio.

             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Managers and Members of:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC
Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, changes
in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Fund, LLC (hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at January 31, 2006, and the
results of each of their operations, cash flows and the changes in each of their
members' capital and the financial highlights for each of the periods presented,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments with the
portfolio funds at January 31, 2006, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC,
Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC, and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Fund, LLC valued at $308,817,425 (96.4% of the Fund's net assets),
$61,665,640 (92.7% of the Fund's net assets), $436,162,358 (92.4% of the Fund's
net assets), $85,763,127 (89.7% of the Fund's net assets), and $67,561,003
(92.7% of the Fund's net assets) respectively, at January 31, 2006, the values
of which have been estimated by the Investment Manager, under general
supervision of the Board of Managers, in the absence of readily ascertainable
market values. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and
the difference could be material.

1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (collectively the "Funds" and
individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of Delaware as limited liability
companies. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
companies. Each of the Funds is a fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital
appreciation by allocating their assets among a select group of private
investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds) ("Portfolio Funds") that
utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies specific for each Fund to
produce an attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent
of the various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes. Aetos
Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the Investment Manager to the Funds.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.

Aetos Capital Opprortunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

                                                                              25
                                                                          <PAGE>


                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by Members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

                                                                              26
                                                                          <PAGE>


                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

Costs incurred in connection with the organization of the Opportunities Fund
totaling $20,866 were expensed at the commencement of operations. These costs
were principally comprised of legal, audit and regulatory filing fees.

Costs incurred with the initial registration and offering of Interests in the
Opportunities Fund totaling $45,093 were deferred and are being amortized over a
period of one year, commencing with operations.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant. Such
withholdings are listed as distributions on the Statement of Changes in Members'
Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts to which
they apply.

E.  Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of its net
investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and frequency
of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of the
Board.

                                                                              27
                                                                          <PAGE>



                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

F.  Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2007.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.

                                                                              28
                                                                          <PAGE>


                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $25,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $2,500 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,500. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques, including
leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a
high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to
achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio
Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The
Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.

                                                                              29

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK (CONTINUED)

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

         policies and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio
         securities held in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary
         investment management services and for which AAM has the explicit
         authority to vote their proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if
         necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting
         issues as they arise.

         As an investment manager for various clients, including clients
         governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended ("ERISA"), AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to
         manage, acquire and dispose of client account assets, unless the "named
         fiduciary" for an ERISA account has explicitly reserved the authority
         for itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the
         client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will
         vote proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make
         voting decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its

<PAGE>

         ERISA plan clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all
         relevant factors and without undue influence from individuals or groups
         who may have an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy vote. In
         fulfilling its obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a manner it
         deems prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the
         economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held in its
         clients' accounts.

II.      ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

         AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
         on matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided
         that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract
         from the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
         accounts. These matters are set out below:

         (i)      Appointment or election of auditors;
         (ii)     Routine elections or re-elections of directors;
         (iii)    Director's liability and indemnification;
         (iv)     General updating/corrective amendments to charter;
         (v)      Name changes;
         (vi)     Elimination of cumulative voting; and
         (vii)    Elimination of preemptive rights.

III.     ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

         A.       AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of
                  management initiatives which may have a substantive financial
                  or best interest impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion,
                  approval of such initiatives will not detract from the
                  economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
                  accounts. These matters are set out below:

                  (i)     Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes
                          of stock and voting rights;
                  (ii)    Changes in capitalization authorization for stock
                          splits, stock dividends, and other specified needs
                          which are no more than 50% of the existing
                          authorization;
                  (iii)   Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not
                          less than 85% of fair market value;
                  (iv)    Stock option plans that are incentive based and not
                          excessive;
                  (v)     Other stock-based plans which are appropriately
                          structured;
                  (vi)    Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and
                  (vii)   Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

         B.       AAM will generally not vote in support of management on
                  certain issues which have a potential substantive financial or
                  best interest impact when AAM believes that approval of the
                  proposal may negatively impact the economic value of the
                  company's securities held in AAM client accounts. These
                  matters are set out below:

                  (i)     Capitalization changes which add classes of stock
                          which are blank check in nature or that dilute the
                          voting interests of existing shareholders;
                  (ii)    Changes in capitalization authorization where
                          management does not offer an appropriate rationale or
                          that are contrary to the best interest of existing
                          shareholders;
                  (iii)   Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to
                          prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                          their rights or effectively deter appropriate tender
                          offers and other offers;
                  (iv)    Amendments to by-laws which would require
                          supermajority shareholder votes to pass or repeal
                          certain provisions;
                  (v)     Classified boards of directors;
                  (vi)    Reincorporation into a state which has more stringent
                          anti-takeover and related provisions;
                  (vii)   Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate
                          offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                          trigger provisions which prevent legitimate offers
                          from proceeding;
                  (viii)  Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation
                          related proposals;

<PAGE>

                  (ix)    Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                          compensation plans, employment contracts and
                          severance agreements that benefit management and
                          would be costly to shareholders if triggered; and
                  (x)     "Other business as properly comes before the meeting"
                          proposals which give a blank check to those acting as
                          proxy.

IV.      SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

         AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
         matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such
         matters, usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party
         analyses of these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in
         our view negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will
         oppose it.

V.       CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

         Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
         interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
         conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy
         of disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
         before voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting
         guidelines if the application of the guidelines to the matter do not
         involve the exercise of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using the
         recommendations of an independent third party.

VI.      PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

         AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
         procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf
         of clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting
         information; and (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM that
         were material in making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the
         above-mentioned records for a minimum of five years.

VII.     PROXY ADMINISTRATION

         AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
         positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and
         oversees the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief
         Investment Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel,
         analyzes types of proposals based on whether they would adversely
         affect shareholder's interests and make a company less attractive to
         own. In evaluating proxy proposals each year, the Committee relies upon
         our own knowledge of each company and its management, independent
         research provided by third parties, and information presented by
         company managements and shareholder groups.

         Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are
         distributed to AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines.
         Ultimately, the investment professional primarily accountable for a
         portfolio is responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio. Most
         vote consistent with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will take an
         independent view on certain issues and vote differently. When an
         investment professional casts votes which are counter to the
         Committee's guidelines, they are required to document their reasons in
         writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of Managers of the AAM
         Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies, and voting
         records.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager manages multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition to the Funds, these other accounts may include separate accounts,
collective trusts, or offshore funds. The Investment Manager manages potential
conflicts between funds or with other types of accounts through allocation
policies and procedures, internal review processes, and oversight by directors
and independent third parties. The Investment Manager has developed trade
allocation procedures and controls to ensure that no one client, regardless of
type, is intentionally favored at the expense of another. Allocation policies
are designed to address potential conflicts in situations where two or more
funds or accounts participate in investment decisions involving the same
securities.

(a)(3)

DESCRIPTION OF COMPENSATION

Professionals employed by the Investment Manager are subject to a compensation
structure that includes base salary and a discretionary bonus. Bonuses are
variable and depend on many factors, including firm, business unit and
individual performance relative to established benchmarks and criteria.
Individuals that consistently exceed performance objectives are eligible for
promotions and/or equity participation in the firm. Officers are also eligible
to share in the net profits of the business under a profit participation plan.
Participation amounts are determined on the basis of performance and
contribution. In addition, all managing directors of the Investment Manager have
a common equity membership in Aetos Capital, LLC.

(a)(4)

OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES

As of January 31, 2006 the portfolio managers owned Interests of the Funds as
follows:

    Anne Casscells            $100,001-500,000

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing integrity of financial reporting and transactions. The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.       SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of
Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Insofar as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies and procedures that govern the conduct of all of Aetos' employees,
including the Covered Officers, such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles, policies and procedures conflict with
the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this Code. In addition to this Code or any other code of ethics
previously adopted by Aetos, the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") and rules promulgated thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching. Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment Company Act or Advisers Act provisions or the rules thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.      REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

         1.       Engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct, including
                  the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of
                  interest between personal and professional relationships;

         2.       Act responsibly in producing and produce, full, fair,
                  accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and
                  documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other
                  public communications made by the Funds;

         3.       Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and
                  regulations;

         4.       Promptly report suspected material violations of this Code,
                  including violations of securities laws or other laws, rules
                  and regulations applicable to the Funds, to Aetos' General
                  Counsel and the Audit Committee; and

         5.       Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity, including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos' policies, and place the interests of the Funds before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.


<PAGE>


Each Covered Officer is required to familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others, including, but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds, and their respective independent managers, independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
employees of the Funds and Aetos with the goal of promoting full, fair,
accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made
by the Funds.

It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III.     AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The overarching principle of this Code is that the personal interests of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict of interest in an ethical manner; (ii) not use his or her personal
influence or personal relationships to influence investment decisions or
financial reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund; (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of such Fund; and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.      COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow certain procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) all violations and
potential violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General Counsel of Aetos will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations; (iii) if the General Counsel of Aetos determines that a
violation has occurred, he or she will take all appropriate disciplinary or
preventive action and inform the Board of Managers of the Fund of his or her
decision; and (iv) all changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR or otherwise as provided by SEC rules.

Each Covered Officer is required: (i) upon receipt of the Code, to sign and
submit to the General Counsel an acknowledgment stating that he or she has
received, read and understands the Code; (ii) annually thereafter to submit a
statement to the General Counsel confirming that he or she has received, read
and understands the Code and has complied with the requirements of the Code;
(iii) not to retaliate against any employee subordinate to the Covered Officer
for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; and (iv) to
notify the General Counsel of Aetos, as appropriate, if the Covered Officer
observes any irregularities or violations of this Code.

V.       AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

Except with respect to Schedules A and B hereto, which may be updated at any
time, this Code may be amended only by the Board of Managers of each Fund at a
meeting of the Board of Managers duly called for that purpose. Waivers, as
defined in Form N-CSR, from this Code may be granted only by the Board of
Managers of each affected Fund at a meeting of the Board of Managers duly called
for that purpose.
