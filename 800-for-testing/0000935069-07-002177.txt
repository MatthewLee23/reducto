                                  June 30, 2007


TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

     We are pleased to announce that The Gabelli  Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity
Trust")  successfully  completed  its  spin-off  of  The  Gabelli  Healthcare  &
Wellness(Rx) Trust (the "Healthcare Trust") on June 28, 2007. On this date, each
shareholder of the Equity Trust  received one share of the Healthcare  Trust for
every twenty shares owned of Equity Trust common stock.  For news and additional
information regarding the spin-off, please visit our website at www.gabelli.com.

     Due to the spin-off's completion  immediately prior to quarter end, we have
combined the Equity Trust's semi-annual report for the six months ended June 30,
2007 with the  Healthcare  Trust's  initial report for the period ended June 30,
2007.  Enclosed are the financial  statements and the investment  portfolios for
both funds as of June 30, 2007.




- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We  have  separated  the  portfolio  manager's  commentary  from  the  financial
statements and investment  portfolios  due to corporate  governance  regulations
stipulated by the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002. We have done this to ensure that
the content of the portfolio manager's commentary is unrestricted. The financial
statements and investment  portfolios are mailed separately from the commentary.
Both the  commentary and the financial  statements,  including the portfolios of
investments, will be available on our website at www.gabelli.com/funds.

                        THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. AND
                  THE GABELLI HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS(RX) TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Equity  Trust Inc.  (the  "Equity  Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland
corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered  under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  whose primary  objective is long-term growth
of capital. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

     The  Equity  Trust  will  invest  at  least  80% of its  assets  in  equity
securities under normal market conditions (the "80% Policy"). The 80% Policy may
be  changed  without  shareholder  approval.   The  Equity  Trust  will  provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
changes in the 80% Policy.

     The Gabelli  Healthcare  &  Wellness(Rx)  Trust  ("Healthcare  Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory  trust on February 20, 2007 and  registered  under the 1940 Act, whose
objective is long-term  growth of capital.  Investment  operations  commenced on
June 28, 2007.  The Healthcare  Trust had no operations  prior to June 28, 2007,
other than the sale of 12,500 common shares for $100,000 to the Equity Trust. On
June 28, 2007, the Equity Trust contributed  $67,695,672 in cash in exchange for
shares of the Healthcare  Trust, and on the same date distributed such shares to
the  holders  of  record  on June  21,  2007 at the  rate  of one  share  of the
Healthcare Trust for every twenty shares of the Equity Trust common stock.

     Under normal market  conditions,  the Healthcare Trust will invest at least
80% of its  assets in equity  securities  and  income  producing  securities  of
domestic and foreign companies in the healthcare and wellness industries.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies  followed by the Equity Trust and the Healthcare  Trust (each a "Fund",
collectively, the "Funds") in the preparation of their financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of  Directors  for the  Equity  Trust or the  Board  of  Trustees  for the
Healthcare  Trust (the  "Board" or the  "Boards") so  determines,  by such other
method as the respective Board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair
market value.  Portfolio  securities traded on more than one national securities
exchange or market are valued according to the broadest and most  representative
market, as determined by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign  market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but  may be fair  valued  pursuant  to  procedures  established  by the
respective Board if market  conditions change  significantly  after the close of
the foreign  market but prior to the close of business on the day the securities
are being valued. Debt instruments with remaining  maturities of 60 days or less
that are not credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the respective
Board  determines  such amount does not reflect the  securities'  fair value, in
which case these  securities will be fair valued as determined by the respective
Board. Debt instruments  having a maturity greater than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at the average of the latest bid and
asked prices.  If there were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is
valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing
settlement  price of the  exchange  or board  of trade on which  the  applicable
contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Boards.  Fair valuation  methodologies  and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial  information  about the company;  comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign  securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     In September  2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  157, Fair Value
Measurements,  which  clarifies  the  definition  of  fair  value  and  requires
companies  to expand  their  disclosure  about the use of fair  value to measure
assets and  liabilities  in interim  and annual  periods  subsequent  to initial
recognition.  Adoption of SFAS 157  requires  the use of the price that would be
received  to sell  an  asset  or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an  orderly
transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date. SFAS 157 is
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
November 15, 2007, and interim  periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is in the process of reviewing the  requirements  of SFAS 157 against
its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  Each Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At June 30,
2007, the Equity Trust and the Healthcare  Trust had  investments of $85,743,000
and $6,700,000 in repurchase agreements, respectively.

     INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  Each Fund may invest, from time
to time,  in shares of other  investment  companies  (or entities  that would be
considered investment companies but are excluded from the definition pursuant to
certain exceptions under the 1940 Act) (the "Acquired Funds") in accordance with
the 1940 Act and related rules. As a shareholder in the Fund, you would bear the
pro rata portion of the periodic  expenses of the Acquired  Funds in addition to
the Fund's  expenses.  For the six months ended June 30, 2007,  the Equity Trust
and the Healthcare  Trust's pro rata portion of the periodic expenses charged by
the Acquired Funds was less than one basis point.

     OPTIONS.  Each Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Fund  receives  a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial  instrument  underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain,  to the  extent of the  premium,  if the price of the  financial
instrument increases between those dates.

     As a  purchaser  of put  options,  the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines, the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or

                                       21
<PAGE>

                        THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. AND
                   THE GABELLI HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS(RX) TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

exercise.  If the price of the underlying  security increases or stays the same,
the Fund would realize a loss upon sale or at expiration  date,  but only to the
extent of the premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money",  "at-the-money", and "out-of-the-money",  respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the
price of the underlying security will remain stable or advance moderately during
the option  period,  and (c)  out-of-the-money  call  options  when the  Adviser
expects that the premiums  received from writing the call option will be greater
than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security above the exercise
price. By writing a call option,  the Fund limits its opportunity to profit from
any increase in the market value of the  underlying  security above the exercise
price  of the  option.  Out-of-the-money,  at-the-money,  and  in-the-money  put
options (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of exercise  price to
market  price) may be utilized in the same  market  environments  that such call
options are used in equivalent transactions.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Funds  may  enter  into  interest  rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statements  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest  rate swap,  a Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the  "counterparty")
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund periodically a variable rate payment that, for the Equity Trust,
is intended to approximate the Equity Trust's  variable rate payment  obligation
on Series C Preferred Stock. In an interest rate cap, a Fund would pay a premium
to the  counterparty  and, to the extent that a  specified  variable  rate index
exceeds a  predetermined  fixed  rate,  would  receive  from  that  counterparty
payments of the difference  based on the notional  amount of such cap.  Interest
rate swap and cap  transactions  introduce  additional  risk  because the Equity
Trust would  remain  obligated  to pay  preferred  stock  dividends  when due in
accordance with the Articles  Supplementary even if the counterparty  defaulted.
If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap contract,  that Fund will be
limited  to  contractual  remedies  pursuant  to the  agreements  related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be
able to meet their obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event
of default,  the Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund
thus  assumes  the risk that it may be delayed in or  prevented  from  obtaining
payments owed to it pursuant to a swap  contract.  The  creditworthiness  of the
swap  contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in order to minimize  this
risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the
returns on a Fund's  portfolio  securities at that point in time, such a default
could  negatively  affect  the  Fund's  ability to make  dividend  payments.  In
addition,  at the time an  interest  rate swap or cap  transaction  reaches  its
scheduled  termination  date,  there is a risk  that a Fund  will not be able to
obtain a replacement  transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not
be as favorable as on the expiring transaction.  If this occurs, it could have a
negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments.

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market  and  counterparty  risk  in  excess  of  the  amount  recognized  in the
Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the Statements of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statements of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

* Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

     FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  Each Fund may  engage  in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase.  Upon entering into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation)  on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market. Open futures contracts at June 30, 2007
are reflected within the Schedules of Investments.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. Each Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in unrealized  appreciation/(depreciation)  on investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At June 30, 2007, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts in the Funds.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of each Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/(depreciation)  on investments and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency transactions, and the

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends  recorded on the books
of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.  The portion of foreign currency
gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in exchange rates between the initial
trade date and subsequent sale trade date is included in realized gain/(loss) on
investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  Each Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES.  The Funds may be subject to foreign taxes on income,  gains
on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Funds will accrue such taxes and  recoveries as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The Equity Trust may invest up to 10%
of its net  assets in  securities  for  which  the  markets  are  illiquid.  The
Healthcare  Trust may invest  without  limit in  illiquid  securities.  Illiquid
securities include securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial
legal  or  contractual  restrictions.  The  sale of  illiquid  securities  often
requires more time and results in higher  brokerage  charges or dealer discounts
and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading
on national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets.  Restricted
securities  may  sell at a price  lower  than  similar  securities  that are not
subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities  freely saleable among qualified
institutional investors under special rules adopted by the SEC may be treated as
liquid  if they  satisfy  liquidity  standards  established  by the  Board.  The
continued  liquidity  of  such  securities  is not as  well  assured  as that of
publicly  traded  securities,  and  accordingly  the Board  will  monitor  their
liquidity.

     CONCENTRATION RISKS. The Healthcare Trust will invest a significant portion
of its assets in  companies in the  healthcare  and  wellness  industries.  As a
result, the Healthcare Trust may be more susceptible to economic, political, and
regulatory  developments  in this particular  sector of the market,  positive or
negative,  and may experience increased volatility to the Healthcare Trust's NAV
and a magnified effect in its total return.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN  FEE  CREDITS  AND  INTEREST  EXPENSE.  When  cash  balances  are
maintained in the custody account,  each Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included  in  custodian   fees  in  the   Statements  of  Operations   with  the
corresponding  expense  offset,  if any, shown as "custodian fee credits".  When
cash balances are  overdrawn,  the  respective  Fund is charged an overdraft fee
equal to 110% of the 90 day Treasury  Bill rate on  outstanding  balances.  This
amount,  if any,  would be shown as  "interest  expense"  in the  Statements  of
Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and  foreign  currency   transactions   held  by  the  respective  Fund,  timing
differences, and differing characterizations of

                                       24

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

distributions  made by the  Funds.  Distributions  from  net  investment  income
include net realized  gains on foreign  currency  transactions.  These  book/tax
differences  are either  temporary or  permanent in nature.  To the extent these
differences  are  permanent,  adjustments  are made to the  appropriate  capital
accounts in the period when the differences arise. These  reclassifications have
no impact on the NAV of the Funds.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of  the  Equity  Trust's  7.20%  Series  B
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock,
5.875% Series D Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock,  and 6.20% Series F Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Cumulative
Preferred  Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described
in Note 5.

     The tax  character  of  distributions  paid  during the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2006 for the Equity Trust was as follows:

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Equity Trust intends to continue to qualify
as, and the  Healthcare  Trust intends to elect to be treated and to qualify as,
regulated  investment  companies under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of each Fund to comply with
the requirements of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net  capital  gains.  Therefore,  no  provisions  for federal  income  taxes are
required.
     As of December 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

           Net unrealized appreciation on investments ...........  $475,036,839

                        THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. AND

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     In July  2006,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting  for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an  Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("the
Interpretation").  The  Interpretation  established for all entities,  including
pass-through  entities  such as the Funds,  a minimum  threshold  for  financial
statement  recognition  of the benefit of positions  taken in filing tax returns
(including  whether  an entity is  taxable in a  particular  jurisdiction),  and
required certain expanded tax disclosures. The Interpretation was implemented by
the Funds on June 29, 2007 and applied to all open tax years as of the effective
date.  Management  has evaluated the  application of the  Interpretation  to the
Funds,  and the  adoption  of the  Interpretation  had no impact on the  amounts
reported in the Funds' financial statements.

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  Each Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's  average
weekly net assets  including the  liquidation  value of preferred  stock for the
Equity Trust. In accordance with the Advisory Agreements, the Adviser provides a
continuous  investment  program  for each  Fund's  portfolio  and  oversees  the
administration of all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. For the Equity
Trust,  the Adviser has agreed to reduce the management  fee on the  incremental
assets attributable to the Cumulative Preferred Stock if the total return of the
NAV of the  common  shares of the  Equity  Trust,  including  distributions  and
advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed the stated  dividend rate or
corresponding  swap rate of each particular  series of the Cumulative  Preferred
Stock for the fiscal year.

     The  Equity  Trust's  total  return  on the  NAV of the  common  shares  is
monitored  on a monthly  basis to assess  whether the total return on the NAV of
the common shares exceeds the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of
each particular series of Cumulative Preferred Stock for the period. For the six
months ended June 30, 2007,  the Equity  Trust's  total return on the NAV of the
common shares  exceeded the stated dividend rate on  corresponding  swap rate of
Series C Auction Rate,  5.875% Series D, Series E Auction Rate, and 6.20% Series
F  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  Thus,  management  fees were  accrued on these
assets.  The Equity  Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the common
shares did not exceed the stated  dividend  rate or  corresponding  swap rate of
7.20% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees with respect to
the  liquidation  value of these preferred stock assets in the amount of $23,733
were not accrued.

     During the period ended June 30, 2007,  the Equity Trust and the Healthcare
Trust paid brokerage commissions of $208,934 and $718, respectively,  to Gabelli
& Company, Inc. ("Gabelli & Company"), an affiliate of the Adviser.

     The  cost of  calculating  each  Fund's  NAV per  share  is a Fund  expense
pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser.  During the
period ended June 30, 2007,  the Equity Trust and the  Healthcare  Trust paid or
accrued  $22,375 and $371,  respectively,  to the Adviser in connection with the
cost of computing each Fund's NAV.

     The Equity Trust and the Healthcare Trust are assuming their portion of the
allocated cost of the Gabelli Funds' Chief  Compliance  Officer in the amount of
$16,894  and $0,  respectively,  for the period  ended June 30,  2007,  which is
included in payroll expenses in the Statements of Operations.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Equity Trust compensates  officers of
the Equity  Trust that are  employed by the Equity Trust and are not employed by
the  Adviser  (although  the  officers  may  receive  incentive-based   variable
compensation from affiliates of the Adviser).  For the six months ended June 30,
2007,  the Fund paid  $103,213,  which is  included  in payroll  expenses in the
Statement of Operations.

     The  Equity  Trust  pays  each  Director  that is not  considered  to be an
affiliated  person an annual  retainer  of  $12,000  plus  $1,500 for each Board
meeting  attended  in  person  and $500  per  telephonic  meeting,  and they are
reimbursed for any out of

pocket expenses  incurred in attending  meetings.  All Board  committee  members
receive $1,000 per meeting attended.  In addition,  the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an annual fee of $3,000,  the Proxy Voting Committee  Chairman receives
an annual fee of $1,500,  and the  Nominating  Committee  Chairman  receives  an
annual fee of $2,000. Directors who are directors or employees of the Adviser or
an affiliated company receive no compensation or expense  reimbursement from the
Equity Trust.

     The  Healthcare  Trust pays each  Trustee  who is not  considered  to be an
affiliated  person an annual  retainer  of $3,000  plus  $1,000  for each  Board
meeting  attended  in  person  and $500  per  telephonic  meeting,  and they are
reimbursed for any out of pocket  expenses  incurred in attending  meetings.  In
addition, the Audit Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $3,000, and the
Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $3,000. Trustees who are
directors  or  employees  of the  Adviser or an  affiliated  company  receive no
compensation or expense reimbursement from the Healthcare Trust.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the period ended June 30, 2007,  other than  short-term  securities,  aggregated
$297,311,898 and $128,740,863, respectively, for the Equity Trust and $1,245,498
and $0, respectively, for the Healthcare Trust.

5. CAPITAL.  The charter permits the Equity Trust to issue 246,000,000 shares of
common  stock  (par value  $0.001)  and  authorizes  the Board to  increase  its
authorized  shares from time to time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of
its shares on the open  market when the shares are trading on the New York Stock
Exchange  ("NYSE") at a discount of 10% or more (or such other percentage as the
Board may  determine  from time to time) from the NAV of the shares.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2007,  the Equity Trust did not  repurchase any shares
of its common stock in the open market.

     The Healthcare  Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited  number of shares
of  beneficial  interest  (par  value  $0.001).  The  Board has  authorized  the
repurchase  of its shares on the open  market when the shares are trading on the
NYSE at a  discount  of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the NAV of the shares. During the period ended
June 30, 2007, the Healthcare  Trust did not repurchase any of its common shares
in the open market.

                        THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. AND

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The Equity Trust's Articles of  Incorporation,  as amended,  authorizes the
issuance of up to  18,000,000  shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The Cumulative  Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and results
in the  financial  leveraging  of the common  stock.  Such  leveraging  tends to
magnify both the risks and  opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on
shares of the Cumulative  Preferred  Stock are  cumulative.  The Equity Trust is
required by the 1940 Act and by the Articles Supplementary to meet certain asset
coverage tests with respect to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Equity
Trust fails to meet these  requirements  and does not correct such failure,  the
Equity Trust may be required to redeem,  in part or in full, the 7.20% Series B,
Series C Auction Rate,  5.875% Series D, Series E Auction Rate, and 6.20% Series
F Cumulative Preferred Stock at redemption prices of $25, $25,000, $25, $25,000,
and $25,  respectively,  per share plus an amount equal to the  accumulated  and
unpaid  dividends  whether or not declared on such shares in order to meet these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure  to  meet  the  foregoing  asset  coverage
requirements  could  restrict  the Equity  Trust's  ability to pay  dividends to
common  shareholders  and  could  lead  to  sales  of  portfolio  securities  at
inopportune  times. The income received on the Equity Trust's assets may vary in
a manner  unrelated to the fixed and variable  rates,  which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
common shareholders.

     On September 21, 2005, the Equity Trust distributed one transferable  right
for each of the 143,681,301  shares of common stock  outstanding to shareholders
of record on that date.  Seven rights were  required to purchase one  additional
common  share at the  subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders  who
exercised  their  full  primary   subscription   rights  were  eligible  for  an
over-subscription  privilege  entitling  them to  subscribe,  subject to certain
limitations and a pro-rata  allotment,  for any additional  shares not purchased
pursuant to the primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized
by the Board in accordance with the  registration  statement.  The  subscription
period  expired on October 26, 2005. The rights  offering was fully  subscribed,
having received over-subscription requests in excess of the shares available for
primary  subscription  resulting in the issuance of 20,525,901  shares of common
stock and  proceeds  of  $143,681,307  to the Fund,  prior to the  deduction  of
estimated expenses of $600,000. Additional expenses of $151,821 were recorded in
the year ended  December 31, 2006.  The NAV of the Equity  Trust's common shares
was  reduced by  approximately  $0.15 per share as a result of the  issuance  of
shares below NAV.

     On June 20, 2001,  the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $159,329,175
(after  underwriting  discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325)
from the  public  offering  of  6,600,000  shares of 7.20%  Series B  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock. The Series B Preferred Shares were callable at any time at the
liquidation  value plus accrued  dividends  following the expiration of the five
year call  protection on June 20, 2006. On June 26, 2006,  the Equity Trust,  as
authorized  by the Board,  redeemed 25%  (1,650,000  shares) of its  outstanding
7.20% Series B Cumulative  Preferred Stock at the redemption price of $25.00 per
share (the  liquidation  value).  On January 8, 2007, the Fund, as authorized by
the Board,  redeemed the balance  (4,950,000  shares) of its  outstanding  7.20%
Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock at the redemption price of $25.00 per share,
plus accumulated and unpaid  dividends  through the redemption date of $0.06 per
share.

     On June 27, 2002,  the Equity Trust  received net proceeds of  $128,246,557
(after  underwriting  discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443)
from the public  offering of 5,200  shares of Series C Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally  held every seven days, is expected to vary with  short-term  interest
rates.  The dividend rates of Series C Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
ranged  from 4.80% to 5.25% for the six months  ended  June 30,  2007.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit an order to hold,  bid,  or sell  such  shares on each
auction date. Series C Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock shareholders may
also trade shares in the secondary market.  The Equity Trust, at its option, may
redeem the Series C Auction Rate Cumulative

from the public  offering of 2,000  shares of Series E Auction  Rate  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is
generally  held every seven days, is expected to vary with  short-term  interest
rates.  The dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
ranged  from 4.65% to 5.20% for the six months  ended  June 30,  2007.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit an order to hold,  bid,  or sell  such  shares on each

stock,  voting  as a single  class,  will be  required  to  approve  any plan of
reorganization  adversely  affecting  the preferred  stock,  and the approval of
two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the Equity Trust's outstanding
voting stock must approve the  conversion  of the Equity Trust from a closed-end
to an open-end investment company. The approval of a majority (as defined in the
1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as defined in the
1940 Act) of the Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities are required to approve
certain other actions,  including changes in the Fund's investment objectives or
fundamental investment policies.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  Each Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However,  the Funds have not had prior  claims or losses  pursuant  to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS.  The Adviser  and/or  affiliates  received  subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund share  trading  practices  involving  certain  funds  managed by the
Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,   Inc.  ("GAMCO"),  the  Adviser's  parent  company,
responded to these  requests for documents and  testimony.  In June 2006,  GAMCO
began discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry.
In February  2007,  the Adviser made an offer of  settlement to the staff of the
SEC for  communication  to the Commission for its  consideration to resolve this
matter.  This offer of settlement is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents.  On a
separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the
SEC that the staff may recommend to the Commission that an administrative remedy
and a monetary penalty be sought from the Adviser in connection with the actions
of two of seven  closed-end  funds  managed by the  Adviser  relating to Section
19(a)  and Rule  19a-1 of the 1940  Act.  These  provisions  require  registered
investment  companies  to provide  written  statements  to  shareholders  when a
dividend is made from a source other than net investment  income.  While the two
closed-end funds sent annual statements and provided other materials  containing
this information, the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with
each  distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser  believes that all of the funds
are now in  compliance.  The Adviser  believes  that these matters would have no
effect on the Funds or any material adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability
to manage the Funds.  The  staff's  notice to the  Adviser did not relate to the
Funds.

8.  SUBSEQUENT  EVENTS.  Effective July 9, 2007,  Kevin V. Dreyer and Jeffrey J.
Jonas, CFA were named Associate  Portfolio Managers of the Healthcare Trust. Mr.
Dreyer and Mr.  Jonas will manage a portion of the assets of the  portfolio  and
report to Mario J. Gabelli,  Portfolio Manager of the Healthcare Trust and Chief
Investment Officer - Value Portfolios for the Adviser.

Mr.  Dreyer joined  Gabelli  & Company, Inc. in 2005 as a research  analyst upon
earning an MBA from Columbia Business School. Mr. Dreyer previously worked as an
investment  banking  analyst  at  Banc  of  America  Securities   following  his
graduation from the University of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Jonas joined Gabelli & Company, Inc. in 2003 as a research analyst. Prior to
his appointment as Associate Portfolio Manager of the Healthcare Trust, Mr.Jonas
served as co-portfolio manager of GAMCO Medical  Opportunities LP. Mr. Jonas was
a  Presidential  Scholar at Boston College where he received a BS in finance and
management information systems.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

Section  15(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940
Act"),  contemplates  that the Board of Directors  (the  "Board") of The Gabelli
Equity Trust Inc. (the  "Fund"),  including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment  advisory agreement and are not
"interested  persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the  "Independent
Board Members"), are required annually to review and re-approve the terms of the
Fund's  existing  investment  advisory  agreement and approve any newly proposed
terms therein.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed and re-approved,  during the
most recent six month period  covered by this report,  the  Investment  Advisory
Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") for
the Fund.

More specifically,  at a meeting held on May 16, 2007, the Board,  including the
Independent  Board Members,  considered the factors and reached the  conclusions
described  below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the re-approval of
the Advisory Agreement.

NATURE,   EXTENT,  AND  QUALITY  OF  SERVICES.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered the nature,  quality,  and extent of  administrative  and shareholder
services performed by the Adviser,  including portfolio management,  supervision
of Fund  operations and compliance  and  regulatory  filings and  disclosures to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund legal
issues,  assisting the Independent Board Members in their capacity as directors,
and other services.  The Independent  Board Members  concluded that the services
are extensive in nature and that the Adviser consistently delivered a high level
of service.

INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND AND ADVISER.  The Independent  Board Members
considered  short-term and long-term  investment  performance  for the Fund over
various  periods of time as compared  to both  relevant  equity  indices and the
performance of the Fund's Lipper Inc. peer group, and concluded that the Adviser
was  delivering  good  performance   results   consistent  with  the  investment
strategies being pursued by the Fund.

COSTS OF SERVICES AND PROFITS REALIZED BY THE ADVISER.

(A) COSTS OF SERVICES TO FUND: FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Independent Board Members
considered the Fund's management fee rate and expense ratio relative to industry
averages for the Fund's peer group category and the advisory fees charged by the
Adviser and its affiliates to other fund and non-fund  clients.  The Independent
Board Members  noted that the mix of services  under the Agreement are much more
extensive  than those under the advisory  agreements for non-fund  clients.  The
Independent  Board Members  recognized that the investment  advisory fee paid by
the Fund and the Fund's overall expense ratio is higher than the average for its
peer group, but concluded that the fee is acceptable based upon the performance,
experience, reputation, and qualifications of the Adviser.

(B)  PROFITABILITY  AND COSTS OF  SERVICES  TO ADVISER.  The  Independent  Board
Members considered the Adviser's overall  profitability and costs, and pro forma
estimates of the Adviser's  profitability and costs attributable to the Fund (i)
as part of the Gabelli fund complex and (ii) assuming the Fund  constituted  the
Adviser's only investment  company under its management.  The Independent  Board
Members also considered  whether the amount of profit is a fair  entrepreneurial
profit  for  the  management  of  the  Fund  and  noted  that  the  Adviser  has
substantially  increased  its  resources  devoted to Fund matters in response to
regulatory   requirements  and  enhanced  Fund  policies  and  procedures.   The
Independent Board Members  concluded that the Adviser's  profitability was at an
acceptable level.

                                       34
<PAGE>

EXTENT OF  ECONOMIES  OF SCALE AS FUND  GROWS.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered  whether  there  have been  economies  of scale  with  respect to the
management of the Fund and whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from any
economies of scale. The Independent  Board Members noted that economies of scale
may develop  for certain  funds as their  assets  increase  and their fund level
expenses  decline as a percentage  of assets,  but that fund level  economies of
scale may not necessarily  result in Adviser level economies of scale. They also
recognized that the Adviser has agreed to reduce the advisory fee on incremental
assets  attributable  to the preferred  shares if the total return of the common
shares does not exceed a  specified  amount  (i.e.,  the  dividend  rate paid on
preferred  shares.) The Board Members  concluded  that there was an  appropriate
sharing of economies of scale.

WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT  ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The  Independent  Board Members
also  considered  whether the advisory fee rate is reasonable in relation to the
asset size of the Fund and any  economies of scale that may exist and  concluded
that the Fund's  current  fee  schedule  (without  breakpoints)  was  considered
reasonable.

OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS.

(A)  ADVISER PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Independent Board Members considered the
size,   education,   and  experience  of  the  Adviser's  staff,  the  Adviser's
fundamental  research  capabilities  and the Adviser's  approach to  recruiting,
training,  and retaining  portfolio  managers and other  research and management
personnel,  and concluded that in each of these areas the Adviser was structured
in such a way to support the high level of services being provided to the Fund.

(B) OTHER BENEFITS TO THE ADVISER. The Independent Board Members also considered
the character and amount of other  incidental  benefits  received by the Adviser
and its affiliates  from its association  with the Fund. The  Independent  Board
Members  considered  the  brokerage  commissions  paid  to an  affiliate  of the
Adviser.  The  Independent  Board Members  concluded that  potential  "fall-out"
benefits  that the Adviser and its  affiliates  may receive,  such as affiliated
brokerage commissions,  greater name recognition, or increased ability to obtain
research services, appear to be reasonable.

CONCLUSIONS.  In  considering  the Advisory  Agreement,  the  Independent  Board
Members did not  identify any factor as  all-important  or  all-controlling  and
instead considered these factors collectively in light of the Fund's surrounding
circumstances.  Based on this  review,  it was the  judgment of the  Independent
Board  Members that  shareholders  had received over the long term good absolute
and relative  performance at reasonable fees and, therefore,  re-approval of the
Advisory  Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its  shareholders.
As a part of its decision  making process,  the Independent  Board Members noted
that the Adviser has managed the Fund since its inception,  and the  Independent
Board   Members   believe  that  a  long-term   relationship   with  a  capable,
conscientious  adviser is in the best  interests  of the Fund.  The  Independent
Board Members  considered,  generally,  that  shareholders  invested in the Fund
knowing that the Adviser  managed the Fund and knowing its  investment  advisory
fee schedule. As such, the Independent Board Members considered,  in particular,
whether  the  Adviser  managed  the  Fund  in  accordance  with  its  investment
objectives  and policies as disclosed to  shareholders.  The  Independent  Board
Members  concluded that the Fund was managed by the Adviser  consistent with its
investment objectives and policies.

Upon  conclusion of their review and discussion,  the Independent  Board Members
unanimously  agreed to recommend the continuation of the Advisory  Agreement for
the Fund.

                   THE GABELLI HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS(RX) TRUST

  BOARD CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

Section  15(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940
Act"),  contemplates  that the Board of  Trustees  (the  "Board") of The Gabelli
Healthcare  &  Wellness(Rx)  Trust (the  "Fund"),  including  a majority  of the
Trustees  who have no direct or  indirect  interest in the  investment  advisory
agreement and are not  "interested  persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940
Act (the  "Independent  Board Members"),  are required to review and approve the
terms of the Fund's proposed investment advisory agreement.  In this regard, the
Board reviewed and approved,  during the most recent six month period covered by
this report, the Investment  Advisory Agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with
Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") for the Fund.

More specifically,  at a meeting held on February 22, 2007, the Board, including
the  Independent   Board  Members,   considered  the  factors  and  reached  the
conclusions  described  below  relating to the  selection of the Adviser and the
approval of the Advisory Agreement.

NATURE,   EXTENT,  AND  QUALITY  OF  SERVICES.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered  the  nature,  quality,  and extent of  proposed  administrative  and
shareholder  services  to be  performed  by  the  Adviser,  including  portfolio
management, supervision of Fund operations and compliance and regulatory filings
and disclosures to shareholders,  general oversight of other service  providers,
review of Fund legal issues,  assisting the  Independent  Board Members in their
capacity  as  trustees,  and  other  services.  The  Independent  Board  members
concluded that the proposed services are extensive in nature.

INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE  OF THE  FUND AND THE  ADVISER.  The  Independent  Board
Members  considered  short-term and long-term  investment  performance for other
registered and  unregistered  funds advised or subadvised by the Adviser and its
affiliates  that invest  regularly in  healthcare  and wellness  companies  over
various  periods of time as compared with both relevant  equity  indices and the
performance of the Fund's Lipper,  Inc. peer group and concluded that,  although
the Fund had no performance history as it had not yet commenced operations,  the
Adviser appeared to have the capability of delivering  satisfactory  performance
results consistent with the investment strategies to be pursued by the Fund.

COST OF SERVICES AND PROFITS REALIZED BY THE ADVISER.

(A) COSTS OF SERVICES TO THE FUND:  FEES AND  EXPENSES.  The  Independent  Board
Members  considered  the Fund's  proposed  advisory  fee rate and expense  ratio
relative  to  industry  averages  for the  Fund's  peer group  category  and the
advisory  fees  charged  by the  Adviser  and its  affiliates  to other fund and
non-fund  clients.  The Independent Board members noted that the mix of services
under the  Advisory  Agreement is more  extensive  than those under the advisory
agreements for non-fund clients.  The Independent Board Members  recognized that
the advisory fee to be paid by the Fund was slightly  higher than the median fee
to its  peer  group,  but  concluded  that  the fee is  acceptable  based on the
qualifications, experience, reputation, and performance of the Adviser.

(B)  PROFITABILITY  AND COSTS OF  SERVICES  TO ADVISER.  The  Independent  Board
Members  considered the Adviser's overall  profitability and costs and discussed
the potential profitability of the Fund. The Independent Board Members concluded
that the potential profitability of the Fund to the Adviser was acceptable.

EXTENT OF  ECONOMIES  OF SCALE AS FUND  GROWS.  The  Independent  Board  Members
considered whether economies of scale would occur with respect to the management
of the Fund and whether the Fund would benefit from any economies of scale.  The
Independent  Board members noted that economies of scale may develop for certain
funds as their  assets  increase  and their  fund  level  expenses  decline as a
percentage of assets, but that fund level economies of scale may not necessarily
result in Adviser  level  economies  of scale.  The  Independent  Board  members
concluded  that after the  completion of the offering,  meaningful  economies of
scale could not occur in the absence of secondary offerings.

                                       36
<PAGE>

WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT  ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The  Independent  Board Members
also  considered  whether the advisory fee rate is reasonable in relation to the
initial asset size of the Fund and any economies of scale that could exist.  The
Independent  Board members  concluded that the  investment  advisory fee for the
Fund did not take into  account  any  potential  economies  of scale  that might
develop.

OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS.

(A)ADVISER  PERSONNEL AND METHODS.  The Independent Board Members considered the
size,   education,   and  experience  of  the  Adviser's  staff,  the  Adviser's
fundamental  research  capabilities,  and the Adviser's  approach to recruiting,
training,  and retaining  portfolio  managers and other  research and management
personnel and concluded that, in each of these areas, the Adviser was structured
in such a way to support the high level of services being provided to the Fund.

(B) OTHER BENEFITS TO THE ADVISER. The Independent Board members also considered
the character and amount of other  incidental  benefits  received by the Adviser
and its affiliates  from its association  with the Fund. The  Independent  Board
Members  considered that brokerage  commissions could be paid to an affiliate of
the Adviser.  The Independent  Board Members concluded that potential "fall out"
benefits  that the Adviser and its  affiliates  may receive,  such as affiliated
brokerage commissions,  greater name recognition, or increased ability to obtain
research services, appear to be reasonable.

CONCLUSION.  In considering  the proposed  Advisory  Agreement,  the Independent
Board  Members  did  not  identify  any  factor  as  all-important  and  instead
considered  these  factors  collectively  in  light  of the  Fund's  surrounding
circumstances.  Based on their  review,  it was the judgment of the  Independent
Board members that the Fund would enjoy highly  experienced  portfolio  advisory
services  and good  ancillary  services  at an  acceptable  fee and,  therefore,
approval  of  the  Advisory   Agreement  would  be  in  the  best  interests  of
shareholders.  Upon conclusion of their review and  discussion,  the Independent
Board  Members  unanimously  agreed to  recommend  the  approval of the Advisory
Agreement for the Fund.

         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has  materially

              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
