NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of  Managers").  There are
         six  members of the Board of  Managers,  one of whom is  considered  an
         "interested person" under the Act. The Company's  investment adviser is
         Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability
         company (the  "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer
         Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of  Oppenheimer & Co.
         Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
         Company's  investment  activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory
         agreement  dated  June  5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member  of the
         Adviser,   and  Alkeon  Capital  Management  L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a
         non-managing member of the Adviser.  Investment  professionals employed
         by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
         portfolio  manager,  manage the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of the
         Adviser under the supervision of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit
         participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  At a meeting  held on
         November 1, 2004,  the Board of Managers  approved  the  acceptance  of
         initial  contributions  to the  Company  from new  members  on or after
         January 1, 2005.  The Company may from time to time offer to repurchase
         interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such repurchases will
         be made at such  times and on such  terms as may be  determined  by the
         Board of  Managers,  in its  complete  and  exclusive  discretion.  The
         Adviser  expects  that  generally  it will  recommend  to the  Board of
         Managers that the Company offer to  repurchase  interests  from Members
         twice each year,  effective at the end of the second fiscal quarter and
         again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

      2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         A.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's  securities  are valued at fair value in accordance  with
         policies adopted by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i) Domestic exchange traded securities (other than options and those
         securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

             (1) at their last composite sale prices as reported on the
                 exchanges where those securities are traded; or

             (2) if no sales of those securities are reported on a particular
                 day, the securities are valued based upon their composite bid
                 prices for securities held long, or their composite asked
                 prices for securities sold, not yet purchased, as reported by
                 those exchanges.

         (ii)Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

             (1) at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is the
                 last trade price at or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) adjusted
                 up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the last traded price is
                 below such bid and down to NASDAQ's best offer price if the
                 last trade is above such offer price); or

             (2) if no NOCP is available, at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                 prior to the calculation of the net asset value of the Company;
                 or

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

             (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

             (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the price
                 will be deemed  "stale"  and the value  will be  determined  in
                 accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt securities are valued in accordance with the procedures  described
         above,  which with  respect to such  securities  may include the use of
         valuations  furnished by a pricing  service  which  employs a matrix to
         determine  valuation  for normal  institutional  size trading  units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Disclosures  about  Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         In September  2006,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued   STATEMENT  ON  FINANCIAL   STANDARDS  NO.  157,   "FAIR  VALUE
         MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
         value for  financial  reporting,  establishes a framework for measuring
         fair value and requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair
         value  measurements.  The application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
         years  beginning  after  November 15, 2007 and interim  periods  within
         those fiscal years.

         Various  inputs  are used in  determining  the  value of the  Company's
         investments.  These  inputs are  summarized  in the three broad  levels
         listed below.

         Level 1 - observable  market inputs that are  unadjusted  quoted prices
         for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

         Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
         for similar  securities,  interest rates,  prepayments  speeds,  credit
         risk, etc.).

         Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own
         assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

         The  inputs  or  methodology  used  for  valuing   securities  are  not
         necessarily  an indication  of the risk  associated  with  investing in
         these securities.

         *Other financial instruments are derivative  instruments  not reflected
         in the  Schedule of  Investments,  such as futures,  forwards  and swap
         contracts,  which are valued at unrealized appreciation  (depreciation)
         on the investment.

         C.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within  three  months at the time of purchase as cash  equivalents.  At
         June 30, 2008, $72,190,785 in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank.

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         The  Company  has  reclassified   ($4,652,106)  and  $294,116,842  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2007.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

         In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
         Interpretation  48 ("FIN 48"),  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income
         Taxes".  This  standard  defines  the  threshold  for  recognizing  the
         benefits  of  tax-return  positions  in  the  financial  statements  as
         "more-likely-than-not"  to be  sustained  by the taxing  authority  and
         requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not
         criterion,  based on the largest  benefit  that is more than 50 percent
         likely to be  realized.  Management  has  analyzed  the  Company's  tax
         positions  taken on Federal  income tax  returns for all open tax years
         (tax years ended December 31,  2004-2007) for purposes of  implementing
         FIN 48, and has concluded that a liability of $2,905,000 for income tax
         purposes is required in the Company's financial statements.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         D.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

         The Company  recognizes  interest  and  penalties,  if any,  related to
         unrecognized  tax benefits  within country tax expense in the statement
         of  operations.  During  the  period,  the  Company  did not  incur any
         interest or penalties.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

         During the six months ended June 30, 2008,  Oppenheimer  earned $25,092
         as brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf
         of the Company.  Mainsail Group,  L.L.C., a broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,   earned  $918,693  as  brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the six months
         ended June 30, 2008, an Incentive Allocation of $95,407 was credited to
         the Special  Advisory  Member's  capital  account  and was  included in
         withdrawals  payable  at June 30,  2008,  in the  Statement  of Assets,
         Liabilities  and Members'  Capital.  Based upon the profits for the six
         months ended June 30, 2008,  the incentive  allocation  that would have
         been credited to the Special Advisory  Account is $5,103,821.  However,
         this amount is not reflected in the  accompanying  Statement of Changes
         in Members' Capital because the incentive allocation is credited at the
         end of the calendar year.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  The
         lead independent Manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers
         who are  "interested  persons"  do not  receive any annual or other fee
         from  the  Company.  Managers  who are  not  "interested  persons"  are
         reimbursed  by the Company for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PNC Global Investment  Servicing Inc.  ("PNC"),  formerly known as PFPC
         Inc.,  serves as investor  services and accounting agent to the Company
         and in that capacity  provides certain  accounting,  recordkeeping  and
         investor  related  services.  The Company  pays PNC an  accounting  and
         investor  services fee based primarily on the average net assets of the
         Company as of the last day of each month, payable monthly, subject to a
         minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its discretion.  For the six months ended June 30, 2008,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $116,660.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30, 2008, amounted
         to $1,379,426,889 and $1,379,850,526, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,  for the six  months  ended  June  30,  2008,  amounted  to
         $1,059,050,190 and $1,259,004,374, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2007,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $674,962,863, and $291,428,268, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2007,  accumulated net
         unrealized  appreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet purchased was  $55,382,407,  consisting  of  $97,524,241  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $42,141,834 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet purchased,  net of excess cash, held at the prime broker as of June
         30, 2008.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  For the six months ended June 30, 2008,  the average  daily
         amount of such borrowings was $1,894,588 and the daily weighted average
         annualized   interest  rate  was  1.74%.  The  Company  had  borrowings
         outstanding  at June 30,  2008,  totaling  $816,416  recorded as due to
         broker on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      7. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include options,
         swaps  and  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,  these
         financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell
         other  financial  instruments  at specific  terms at  specified  future
         dates. Each of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of
         off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the
         securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets,  liabilities and members' capital. Primarily all investments in
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased and due from broker are positions
         with,  and  amounts  due  from,  the  prime  broker,   Morgan  Stanley.
         Accordingly, the Company has a concentration of individual counterparty
         credit risk with the prime broker. The Company pledges securities in an
         account at PFPC Trust Company,  for the benefit of the prime broker, to
         meet the margin requirement as determined by the prime broker.

      7. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         A swap is a contract  under  which two parties  agree to make  periodic
         payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index or
         the value of some other instrument,  applied to a stated, or "notional"
         amount.  Swaps  generally  can be  classified  as interest  rate swaps,
         currency swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include
         contracts for difference,  depending on the type of index or instrument
         used to calculate the payments.  Such swaps would  increase or decrease
         the Company's  investment  exposure to the  particular  interest  rate,
         currency,  commodity or equity  involved.  Securities  associated  with
         swaps are marked-to-market  based on the Company's valuation procedures
         that are outlined in Section 2b of these notes.  The change in value of
         swaps,  including  the  periodic  amounts  of  interest  to be  paid or
         received on swaps,  is reported  as  unrealized  gains or losses in the
         Statement of Operations.  Net unrealized gains are reported as an asset
         and net unrealized  losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
         of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. A realized gain or loss is
         recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination
         of swap agreements.

         Most  swap   agreements   entered  into  by  the  Company  require  the
         calculation  of the  obligations  of the parties to the agreements on a
         "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap
         agreement  generally will be equal to only to the net amount to be paid
         or received  under the  agreement  based on the relative  values of the
         positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

         The Company is subject to the market risk  associated  with  changes in
         the  value  of the  underlying  investment  or  instrument,  as well as
         exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on
         swap  contracts.  The risk of loss with  respect to swaps is limited to
         the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually  obligated
         to make. If the other party to a swap  defaults,  the Company's risk of
         loss   consists  of  the  net  amount  of  payments  that  the  Company
         contractually  is entitled to receive,  which may be different than the
         amounts  recorded on the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Members'
         Capital.

         The  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather  than the  notional
         amount,  represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
         respectively.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

      7. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market  value of the  option  written.  If a  written  call  option  is
         exercised,  the premium is added to the  proceeds  from the sale of the
         underlying  security in determining  whether the Company has realized a
         gain or loss.  In writing an option,  the Company bears the market risk
         of an  unfavorable  change  in the  price  of  the  security  or  index
         underlying  the  written  option.  Exercise  of an option  written by a
         counterparty  could result in the Company  selling or buying a security
         at a price different from the current market value.  During for the six
         months ended June 30, 2008, the Company had no  transactions in written
         options.

III.     APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting  held on March 7, 2008,  the Board of Managers of the Company  (the
"Board") completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's investment advisory agreement with the Adviser.

In  approving  the  renewal of the  investment  advisory  agreement,  the Board,
including each of the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written materials
provided  by the  Adviser  at the  request  of the Board and  assessed:  (i) the
nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided to the  Company;  (ii) the
investment  performance of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii)
advisory  fees and other fees and  expenses  of the Company  (including  fee and
expense  information for comparable  funds) and the profitability of the Adviser
and its affiliates with respect to its relationship  with the Company;  (iv) the
extent to which  economies  of scale would be realized as the  Company's  assets
under management increase;  and (v) whether advisory fee levels reflect any such
economies  of scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also  approved the
renewal  of the  administrative  services  agreement  between  the  Company  and
Oppenheimer,  an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In  considering  the nature,  extent and  quality of  services  that the Adviser
provides  to  the  Company,   the  Board  discussed  with  management  staffing,
resources,  and the  organizational  structure  of the  various  departments  of
Oppenheimer  providing  services to the Company.  The Board also  reviewed  with
management the investment management,  compliance,  regulatory, risk management,
administration, accounting infrastructure and investor related services provided
by the Adviser and Oppenheimer and reviewed the costs associated with

providing these services. The Independent Managers had, over the previous twelve
months, considered various matters,  including:  Oppenheimer's commitment to the
advisory business,  including the alternative  investment advisory business, and
its platform of  proprietary  products;  the research and  portfolio  management
capabilities of the personnel responsible for managing the Company's assets; the
appropriateness of the Adviser's staffing levels and the commitment of resources
to fund  accounting  and  administration,  shareholder  services and  regulatory
compliance;  the  Adviser's  oversight of  third-party  service  providers;  the
Company's   investment   performance  and  the   profitability  of  the  Adviser
attributable to providing services to the Company, among other matters.

Management  provided to the Board  information  showing how the Company benefits
from the services  provided by the  Adviser,  including  research and  portfolio
management  services  and also  benefits  from the  administrative  services and
compliance  infrastructure  provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer,  as well as
the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser.

In connection with its consideration of the investment advisory  agreement,  the
Board also reviewed materials relating to the Company's  investment  performance
on a  quarterly  basis.  The Board  also  considered  the  Company's  historical
investment  performance,  including  a  comparison  of such  performance  to the
performance  of similar  funds and  relevant  indices.  During the past year the
investment  performance  of the Company had  improved  and the  consensus of the
Independent Managers was that during the past year the investment performance of
the Company was competitive with its peers. The Independent  Managers  concluded
that  the  fees  paid  to  Oppenheimer  and  the  Adviser  were  reasonable  and
appropriate and were within industry norms,  based on the comparisons to similar
funds.  In particular,  a fee comparison  showed that the fees charged -- a 1.0%
management fee and 20% incentive  allocation -- are at the  mid-to-lower  end of
industry  norms for similar  products.  The  indirect  benefits  received by the
Adviser and its affiliates attributable to its relationships to the Company also
were considered.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services  provided by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer
under the investment  advisory agreement and administrative  services agreement,
respectively.  In this regard,  the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's
fees and expenses to those of comparable  registered  funds,  and concluded that
the Company's fees were  reasonable and  appropriate.  The Board also considered
revenues  received by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer  from the Company,  including
fees  and  incentive  allocations,  as  well  as data  regarding  the  Adviser's
financial  condition,  compensation and profitability,  including related direct
and indirect  operating  expenses  relating to the Company and payments  made to
registered   representatives   of  Oppenheimer  for  services  they  provide  to
investors.  The Board  noted  that  registered  representatives  of  Oppenheimer
continue  to be  paid  out of  Oppenheimer's  resources  for  providing  various
investor  services.  Management  also discussed with the Board the fact that the
positive  performance  of the  Company  during  the past year and the  incentive
allocations  from the  Company  resulting  from this  performance  have  allowed
Oppenheimer  to provide  additional  compensation  to financial  advisers  whose
customers  are  invested in the  Company,  which has  increased  such  financial
advisers'  interest in the Company as an investment  option for their customers.
The Board reviewed the

methodology  used to estimate  these  costs,  as set forth in the  profitability
materials  provided by  management.  It also  considered  the indirect  benefits
received by the Adviser and its affiliates  attributable to their  relationships
to the Company.

Based in part on its review of  information  relating to the Company's  fees and
expenses  and the  profitability  of the Adviser and its  affiliates,  the Board
considered  whether the Company's fees under the investment  advisory  agreement
and  administrative  services  agreement bear a reasonable  relationship  to the
services provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated  with  services  provided to the Company,  the Board  concluded  that
economies of scale are not being realized at the current asset levels.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

1. the nature,  extent and quality of  the services  provided by the Adviser are
adequate and appropriate;

2. the fees paid to the Adviser and  Oppenheimer  are reasonable and appropriate
in light of comparative  expense and advisory fee information and benefits to be
derived  by the  Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  from  their  relationships  with the
Company;

3.  the Adviser's  fees are  reasonable in light of the advisory fees charged by
the Adviser  (and other  affiliates)  and other  investment  advisers to similar
investment  vehicles  receiving  similar  services and in light of the fact that
absent any  performance  allocation,  the  expenses  associated  with  providing
services to the Company had exceeded in the past,  and may exceed in the future,
the fees payable by the Company;

4.  economies  of scale are not being  realized by the Adviser or Oppenheimer at
current asset levels; and

5. the approval  of the renewal of the Company's  investment  advisory agreement
and administrative  services agreement for an additional annual period is in the
best interests of the Company and its members.
