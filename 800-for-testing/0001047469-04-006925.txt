FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:                                               FEBRUARY 2004

Two thousand three was a strong year for equity investors and a good year for
Liberty All-Star Growth Fund shareholders. The Fund generally performed in line
with key benchmarks during 2003. What is more gratifying, the Fund has
outperformed for the past three years - a period that includes a strong 2003 and
the difficult market years of 2001 and 2002, thus demonstrating its ability to
perform well through widely varying market conditions.

    Certainly, the stock market's rebound from three straight negative years - a
phenomenon not seen since 1939-1941 - was universally welcomed. We will look
more closely at 2003 momentarily, but first pause to review the Fund's
performance for the fourth quarter and full year.

PRESIDENT'S LETTER


    Looking at the tables on the previous page, the Fund closed 2003 with a
solid quarter. In terms of net asset value (NAV), the Fund advanced 10.9
percent. Measured in terms of market price, the Fund returned 12.9 percent.
These results compare favorably to the 10.8 percent quarterly return of its
primary benchmark, the Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund Average. For the full
year, the Fund's returns were 33.5 percent and 51.1 percent, respectively, based
on NAV and market price. These results were competitive with the 35.3 percent
return for the Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund Average.

    The past year was a good one for the Fund, but as mentioned, the three-year
period demonstrates the benefits of the Fund's multi-managed structure, as this
time frame encompasses both sharply rising and falling markets. During this
period of widely varying market conditions, the Fund performed favorably
compared to its primary benchmark. As the second table on the previous page
indicates, the Fund is a top quartile performer over the past three years when
ranked against peer funds in the Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Mutual Fund Average,
meaning that it outperformed 75 percent of the funds in that universe.


PERFORMANCE VALIDATES UNDERLYING STRENGTHS

Investment performance - both short term and long term - demonstrates the Fund's
underlying strengths. The Fund's closed-end, multi-management structure provides
shareholders with access to institutional quality investment managers and
exposure to the full spectrum of growth stocks: small-cap, mid-cap and
large-cap. Management and ongoing monitoring by the Fund manager, Liberty Asset
Management Company (LAMCO), ensure alignment with shareholder interests and that
the investment managers are meeting expectations. A fuller description of the
Fund's unique attributes may be found in this Annual Report's feature section,
which immediately follows this letter. I encourage you to review it.

    Turning to 2003, most investors feel that the market's recovery actually
began with the lows reached on October 9, 2002. Using the S&P 500 Index as a
proxy for the broad market, the index gained 8.4 percent in the final quarter of
2002 and then declined 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2003, with investors
moving to the sidelines as war with Iraq moved ever closer. Once hostilities
actually broke out and the uncertainty was removed, investors gained confidence
and returned to the stock market, leading the S&P 500 to a 15.4 percent second
quarter gain. Of course, monetary and fiscal policy helped greatly. The Federal
Reserve lowered the Fed funds rate to 1.0 percent - a level not seen since the
Eisenhower administration - and President Bush shepherded his $350 billion
economic package - including a lower tax on dividends - to Congressional passage
in May. In addition, inflation remained quiescent, corporate profits were strong
(one of the best trough to peak earnings recoveries in the postwar era) and GDP
gained momentum, leading up to an annualized 8-plus percent surge in the third
quarter.

GROWTH LED BY LOWER QUALITY STOCKS

Commenting specifically on the growth style of investing during 2003, small-cap
outperformed large-cap as the Russell indices indicate. Lower quality, lower
priced and more speculative issues outperformed higher quality stocks for most
of the year. That is not unusual in a rebounding economy - especially when ample
monetary stimulus is present - because companies that once looked as though they
might fail suddenly look as though they'll survive. The Fund's managers

have a high quality bias, meaning they do not focus on these more speculative,
lower quality stocks. Over time, quality - defined by growth and stability of
earnings and dividends - almost always wins out. Certainly, the Fund's
investment managers maintained their disciplines and focused on better quality
companies during 2003.

    For further analysis of 2003 and a look ahead, I would recommend to you our
annual Manager Roundtable, which begins on page 11. This year's Roundtable is
especially insightful, as the managers summarize their varying growth
strategies, allowing shareholders to see and compare how each manager's
capitalization and growth philosophy influence their respective outlook and
investment decision making. In addition, in a departure from past Roundtables,
we at LAMCO offer our own comments at the end of each discussion point, allowing
shareholders to gain better insights into the perspective we bring to Fund
management.

    In summary, we are pleased with the Fund's performance in 2003, given its
high quality focus. We feel the same way about its longer-term results, as they
encompass one of the most difficult stock market environments in decades. We are
gratified, as well, that shareholders expressed their confidence in the Fund by
oversubscribing the offering of rights to purchase additional shares of the
Fund, which was conducted during late summer. We are optimistic over prospects
for 2004, but realistically believe that it will be extremely difficult to top
2003. That may be for the better. A sound if unspectacular year may be in
investors' best long-term interests.

    Be assured that as we move forward your team here at LAMCO remains dedicated
to the Fund's founding principles, to integrity in all that we do, and to
managing with our shareholders' best interests first and foremost. We thank you
for your ongoing support of the Fund.


Sincerely,

/s/ William R. Parmentier

UNIQUE FUND ATTRIBUTES


                                MULTI-MANAGEMENT

[GRAPHIC]

Multi-management is the process of allocating Fund assets among several
carefully selected investment managers with complementary investment approaches.
It's an important factor distinguishing Liberty All-Star Growth Fund from other
funds. The Fund doesn't have one investment manager, but three. Why?
Multi-management is intended to diversify the Fund and lower risk. While all of
the Fund's managers practice the growth style of investing, each is selected for
its particular investment strategy and capitalization focus - one small-cap
manager, one mid-cap and one large-cap. This mix of capitalization ranges
recognizes that growth investor preference shifts over time as changing business
and economic conditions favor small-, mid- or large-cap companies. Having three
managers also reduces the volatility that a single growth manager inevitably
encounters, and it has the potential for producing more consistent returns over
time. Thus, in a single investment the Fund provides investors with access to a
diversified portfolio and exposure to the entire capitalization spectrum of
growth companies. Multi-management is widely practiced by large institutional
investors, such as endowments, foundations and pension plans. It is found far
less frequently in funds in which individuals can invest. Liberty Asset
Management Company (LAMCO), the Fund manager, was among the first investment
firms to bring multi-management to individual investors.

CLOSED-END STRUCTURE

[GRAPHIC]

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund is a closed-end fund, a characteristic that
distinguishes it from most investment funds, which are open-end mutual funds. An
open-end mutual fund creates or redeems shares continuously as money flows into
or out of the fund. Closed-end funds, by contrast, have a fixed number of shares
that are traded between investors on a stock exchange (the Fund is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange but trades on other exchanges, as well). Why does
closed-end versus open-end matter to investors? An exchange-traded, closed-end
fund is bought and sold just like the shares of other publicly traded
securities. Pricing is intra-day - not just end-of-day, as is the case with
open-end mutual funds. A transaction price is continuously available and there
are no annual sales fees. From the perspective of the three investment managers,
the Fund's closed-end structure gives them the confidence of knowing that they
will not experience sharp inflows or outflows of assets. Thus, they are able to
focus on stock selection and investing for the long term instead of being
influenced by cash flows that can occur at inappropriate times. Finally,
closed-end funds do not have minimum transaction or balance requirements and do
not incur ongoing costs associated with distributing their shares, often
resulting in lower expense ratios.

PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT

[GRAPHIC]

Investors in Liberty All-Star Growth Fund benefit from having multiple levels of
investment professionals acting on their behalf. At the first level, the
professionals at LAMCO research and evaluate a broad universe of growth
investment management firms, selecting those few that meet a rigorous set of
criteria. Once chosen, the investment managers are closely monitored by LAMCO,
which considers a range of factors, including their investment performance. The
investment managers themselves represent the second level. The investment
managers chosen for Liberty All-Star Growth Fund are institutional-quality
managers - "all-stars" in their field - and operate independently of LAMCO. That
means there are no affiliations or alliances with the investment managers, and
that they have just one mandate: consistent implementation of their style and
strategy in pursuit of good performance. At the third level is the Fund's
independent Board of Directors. This Board, elected by the shareholders, has
oversight responsibility for Fund operations to ensure that decisions made by
LAMCO and the investment managers reflect the shareholders' best interests.

ACCESS TO LEADING INVESTMENT MANAGERS

[GRAPHIC]

Manager selection is perhaps the critical decision for any investor. There are
thousands of investment management firms from which to choose, and their
long-term investment performance varies widely. Many of the most sought-after
investment managers are closed to new investors and many of the best performing
managers invest only for institutions, not individuals. LAMCO provides Fund
shareholders with access to these leading investment managers. In the search for
managers, LAMCO calls on the expertise of its professional staff,
state-of-the-art analytical tools and years of experience in the investment
industry. In selecting investment managers for the Fund, LAMCO conducts in-depth
research and rigorous due diligence, focusing on the "four Ps" ... that is, each
manager's philosophy, process, people and performance. We seek investment
management firms that have demonstrated a consistent application of their growth
strategy and a clearly articulated, disciplined investment process. We also want
to see a well-managed organization and continuity among a firm's investment

ONGOING MONITORING AND REBALANCING

[GRAPHIC]

It's not enough to simply select all-star investment managers. Constant
vigilance is required to ensure that each is performing up to expectations and
contributing to Fund performance. Like all businesses, investment management
firms can change over time. Ownership and key personnel can change. Market
pressures may lead a firm to deviate from its espoused growth strategy.
Individual investors often have difficulty knowing that the fund in which they
originally invested has changed. LAMCO's active monitoring guards against that.
We analyze the Fund's investment managers' trading activity and the
characteristics of their holdings to confirm that they are adhering to their
strategy and performing well relative to their peers. We also evaluate changes
in key decision makers, should they occur. When warranted, LAMCO replaces
managers. LAMCO also proactively rebalances the Fund when necessary. Portfolio
rebalancing maintains the Fund's structural integrity and is a well-recognized
risk management tool. Disciplined, periodic rebalancing keeps the Fund's assets
equally divided among its three investment managers. Owing to shifting market
sentiment and economic conditions, small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap growth
stocks will perform differently over time. This can unbalance the portfolio.
When this happens, LAMCO "locks in" profits by taking assets from the managers
whose capitalization focus has been in favor and gives it to those whose
capitalization focus has been out of favor. While this seems counterintuitive,
it is really a case of taking money from today's winners and redeploying it
among tomorrow's.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

[GRAPHIC]

Since 1997, the Fund has followed a policy of paying annual distributions on its
common stock at a rate of 10 percent of net asset value (paid quarterly at 2.5
percent per quarter), providing a systematic mechanism for distributing funds to
shareholders. Because a portion of the portfolio is turned over when an
investment manager is replaced (often generating realized capital gains), the
Fund's multi-management investment approach and the payout policy complement one
another. Recognizing the diverse needs of the Fund's shareholders, LAMCO also
offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Some investors
prefer their dividends in the form of cash. Others reinvest their dividends in
additional Fund shares, thus letting their dividends compound over time. The
Cash Purchase feature allows shareholders to make additional investments in the
Fund on a monthly basis. LAMCO rounds out its services for shareholders by
providing a range of tools, such as a Web site at www.all-starfunds.com;
communications, such as monthly updates and quarterly reports; and shareholder
assistance via toll-free telephone at 1-800-LIB-FUND.


           IS DEDICATED TO THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF FUND SHAREHOLDERS.

                                                        MANAGER/LAMCO ROUNDTABLE

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE FUND'S INVESTMENT MANAGERS REFLECT THEIR GROWTH
ORIENTATION AS WELL AS THEIR CAPITALIZATION FOCUS

HAVING REMAINED TRUE TO THEIR INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES THROUGH A DIFFICULT MARKET,
THE FUND'S INVESTMENT MANAGERS PRODUCED SOLID RETURNS IN 2003. HERE, THEY
DISCUSS THEIR APPROACHES AND TAKE ON ISSUES RANGING FROM GLOBALIZATION TO
PROSPECTS FOR THE STOCK MARKET.

Continuing a tradition, the Fund's manager, Liberty Asset Management Company
(LAMCO), recently had the opportunity to moderate another annual roundtable with
the Fund's three investment managers. In a departure from past practice, in this
roundtable LAMCO offers its perspective - as a further insight for investors -
at the conclusion of the discussion on each point.

    As would be expected, there is commonality to the managers' comments because
they are all growth style investors. However, in reading this roundtable, Fund
shareholders should make note of differences, as well - reflecting the managers'
varying capitalization focus - small, medium or large cap - and their investment
philosophy, strategy and process. The participating investment managers and
their investment styles are:

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS INTERVIEW REPRESENT THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' VIEWS
AND LAMCO'S PERSPECTIVE AT THE TIME OF THE DISCUSSION (JANUARY 2004) AND ARE
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

M. A. WEATHERBIE & CO., INC.
PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Matthew A. Weatherbie, CFA,
President and Founder

INVESTMENT STYLE/Small-Cap Growth - M.A. Weatherbie practices a small
capitalization growth investment style focusing on high quality companies that
demonstrate superior earnings growth prospects, yet are reasonably priced
relative to their intrinsic value. The firm seeks to provide superior returns
relative to small capitalization growth indices over a full market cycle.

TCW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY
PORTFOLIO MANAGER/Douglas S. Foreman, CFA,
Chief Investment Officer U.S. Equities

INVESTMENT STYLE/Mid-Cap Growth - TCW seeks capital appreciation through
investment in the securities of rapidly growing companies whose business
prospects, in TCW's view, are not properly perceived by consensus research.

WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY, L.L.C.
PORTFOLIO MANAGER/John F. Jostrand, CFA, Principal

INVESTMENT STYLE/Large-Cap Growth - William Blair emphasizes disciplined,
fundamental research to identify quality growth companies with the ability to
sustain their growth over long time periods. At the core of the firm is a group
of analysts, who perform research aimed at identifying companies that have the
opportunity to grow in a sustainable fashion for extended periods of time.

LAMCO: Having all the managers in a roundtable is an excellent opportunity for
Fund shareholders to compare the varying growth investment approaches that are
present in the Fund. Thus, we'd like to open by asking each of you to summarize
your investment philosophy and approach. Let's go by capitalization size, from
small to large. That means starting off with you, Matt Weatherbie.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): We are growth stock investors:
We seek to invest in the best smaller capitalization growth companies in
America. This means companies with some seasoning, a significant competitive
advantage, high inherent profitability, financial strength and proven
entrepreneurial management. Our process is bottom-up and emphasizes both
detailed financial analysis and field

                                       11
<Page>

research to assess the quality of a company's business model and management. We
use a disciplined, proven set of stock valuation techniques to determine good
investment value.

LAMCO: Doug Foreman, summarize your approach, will you please?

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): We're aggressive growth investors. We're looking
for companies with the potential for positive earnings surprise and that have
outstanding business models. Those are our two key criteria. We believe that a
stock is only truly mispriced in the marketplace if the Wall Street consensus
has expectations in terms of growth rate and earnings per share (EPS) that are
below our own. That gap between what our estimates are based on our fundamental
work and what Wall Street expects and will pay for is our alpha, or our ability
to outperform. Overall, our batting average for finding companies that have
sound business models is pretty high, which means the growth these companies are
generating is sustainable and capable of beating expectations.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, tell us about the William Blair large-cap growth approach.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): William Blair employs a quality
growth approach and a fundamental company research process. We define a quality
growth company as one exhibiting superior, long-term earnings growth combined
with a proven and sustainable competitive advantage from a market/brand
position, proprietary product or technology position, or a unique asset base.
These companies generally exhibit superior profitability, high reinvestment
rate, low financial leverage, consistency of returns and strong management. We
have a team of experienced analysts, who are organized into sector teams and led
by a portfolio manager.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS' RESPONSES CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THE
DIVERSIFICATION THAT THE FUND OFFERS TO SHAREHOLDERS. ALL THE MANAGERS FOCUS ON
THE GROWTH STYLE OF INVESTING, BUT THEY FOLLOW VERY DIFFERENT INVESTMENT
DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, WITH ALL THREE CAPITALIZATION RANGES BEING REPRESENTED
IN THE FUND, SHAREHOLDERS COULD BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY, AS INVESTOR
SENTIMENT FREQUENTLY ROTATES AMONG SMALL, MID- AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
DURING SUCH PERIODS.

LAMCO: In a vein similar to our first discussion point, this roundtable also
gives us an opportunity to compare top-down and bottom-up investment approaches.
To what extent are you more a bottom-up manager or a top-down manager? Or do you
factor both perspectives into your thinking? Let's take the responses in reverse
order, from large to small.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): William Blair is 90 percent
bottom-up. The vast majority of our time, resources, and philosophical and
research criteria are devoted to investigating specific investment
opportunities, the industry in which they compete and the managements of those
investment opportunities. We spend some time evaluating the overall environment.
This consists of primarily setting an investment framework in which to establish
proper valuation analysis and examine broad trends in the global economy.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): We are almost exclusively a bottom-up manager.
We build a portfolio stock-by-stock, company-by-company. What we find,

[SIDENOTE]

"WE SEEK TO INVEST IN THE BEST SMALLER CAPITALIZATION GROWTH COMPANIES IN
AMERICA. THIS MEANS COMPANIES WITH SOME SEASONING, A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE, HIGH INHERENT PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND PROVEN
ENTREPRENEURIAL MANAGEMENT."

                                                                MATT WEATHERBIE,
                                                                 M.A. WEATHERBIE

                                       12

though, is that our investment criteria of finding companies that are growing
rapidly, beating expectations and operating with good business models tends to
lead us to areas such as technology, health care, specialty retail, media, and
consumer and business services. The reason we tend to focus on those industries
is that over time they tend to grow faster than the overall economy. Secondly,
there's a lot of change in these industries. If there isn't much change in an
industry or if change occurs glacially, then it's very difficult for a
medium-sized business to add value and take on bigger firms, which possess
inherent advantages, including scale, product breadth, management depth and
geographic coverage. Generally, however, the one key attribute they don't have
is an ability to react quickly to change. That can provide the opportunity for
small and medium-sized companies to create new businesses within those
industries or to find a better, cheaper, faster way to do what's already being
done.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): We are primarily a bottom-up
manager evaluating stocks one at a time. Once or twice a year, however, we
devote an internal research meeting to looking at macro issues to try and make
sure that we are cognizant of important trends that could affect our
investments.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS WE SELECTED PLACE THEIR EMPHASIS ON
BEING GOOD STOCK PICKERS. THEY DON'T IGNORE THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT, BUT THEIR
FOCUS IS ON FINDING SOLID COMPANIES WITH EXCELLENT GROWTH PROSPECTS.

LAMCO: There's a collective sigh of relief now that 2003 has gone down in the
history books as a positive year for equity investors. Looking back, how would
you summarize the stock market during 2003? Doug Foreman, start us off on this
one, please.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): I think 2003 was the flip side of 2002 - almost
a mirror image. Just to retrace: 2002 was the last year of the bear market,
which ended in early October of that year. Until that point in 2002, it didn't
matter what area of the market you were in - small, medium or large, growth or
value - you got tattooed pretty good. But, this is typical of the final stages
of a bear market - everybody gives up on everything. You saw that in 2002. In
2003, we saw the flip side. It was a year in which a rising tide lifted all the
boats, even though small-cap did better than large, which is typical of the
early stages of a recovery.

    The fundamentals in the industries that we follow really bottomed in the
summer of '02. The market didn't take off for a while because it was suffering
through the fallout from various corporate scandals. But beneath the surface,
fundamentals were improving. By the time we got to the third quarter of 2003, we
had an 8 percent plus annualized gain in GDP. By then, investors across the
board were beginning to understand that business had gotten a whole lot better
and stocks hadn't gone up just because they were oversold. They went up because
business conditions improved dramatically.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, how does William Blair see 2003?

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): We summarize 2003 as a dramatic
step back from the brink. Many companies experienced their first positive
financial trends in three years, and the global political/terror picture
improved markedly. Small and cyclical were the two defining characteristics of
winning

[SIDENOTE]

"WE'RE LOOKING FOR COMPANIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR POSITIVE EARNINGS SURPRISE
AND THAT HAVE OUTSTANDING BUSINESS MODELS...THAT GAP BETWEEN WHAT OUR ESTIMATES
ARE... AND WHAT WALL STREET EXPECTS AND WILL PAY FOR IS OUR ALPHA, OR OUR
ABILITY TO OUTPERFORM."

                                                                   DOUG FOREMAN,
                                                                             TCW

                                       13
<Page>

stocks, many of which were up 100 percent or more. Proven growth companies were
up, but significantly less. Still, they turned in a respectable and welcome 20
percent gain.

LAMCO: Recap your views on 2003, please, Matt Weatherbie.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): The year 2003 was one of strong
absolute returns in both large and small company stocks. Within the small cap
universe, it was somewhat frustrating and unexpected that lower quality, low
priced small cap stocks outperformed the high quality stocks we emphasize.
Essentially, in 2003, Federal Reserve monetary policy was extremely
accommodative. This led to an 800-basis point decline in junk bond yields,
bringing over-leveraged companies back from the brink and creating a speculative
stock market, causing low quality to outperform high quality.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: THE MANAGERS WERE WELL POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN A
RECOVERING ECONOMY AND A REBOUNDING STOCK MARKET, AS EVIDENCED BY THE FUND'S 33
PERCENT-PLUS RETURN BASED ON NET ASSET VALUE IN 2003. EQUALLY GRATIFYING, THE
FUND RANKED IN THE TOP QUARTILE AMONG ITS LIPPER MULTI-CAP GROWTH FUND PEERS FOR
THE PAST THREE YEARS, A PERIOD THAT INCLUDED THE NEGATIVE STOCK MARKET YEARS OF
2001 AND 2002 AND THE STRONG 2003.

LAMCO: Liberty All-Star Growth Fund may be a domestic equity fund - but it is
subject to perhaps the most pervasive force of our era: globalization. The
pluses and minuses of globalization are frequently debated - sometimes heatedly.
As an investor, how do you seek to benefit from the upside of globalization, and
how do you seek to protect yourself from its downside? Matt Weatherbie, we'll
stay with you.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): One of the tenets we look for
in a company is a significant competitive advantage. It is important that
globalization be at worst a neutral and, better still, a positive for our
companies. For example, Dollar Tree Stores is a domestic specialty retailer. One
of its significant competitive advantages is its ability, developed over a
number of years, to source unique, high quality merchandise from China. China
has become "the manufacturing floor for the world" and the diverse sources of
product in China that Dollar Tree has established has created a compelling
advantage for it. For our companies that sell overseas as well as in the U.S.,
it is important that they have world-class franchises that enable them to
penetrate growing overseas markets. An example is Microchip Technology, a
manufacturer of microcontrollers that derives 70 percent of its revenues from
non-U.S. markets. Microchip's highly productive R&D, reputation for
cost-effective, technically advanced products and aggressive worldwide
engineering sales network provide this advantage.

LAMCO: Let's hear from Doug Foreman and then from John Jostrand.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): We're domestic-only investors. We make few
direct investments in overseas-based companies. The areas in which we invest -
the ones I mentioned earlier - are the very areas where the U.S. tends to be in
a global competitive lead. There are a few exceptions to that, but, generally,
in areas such as specialty retail, technology and health care the U.S. is the
world-class leader. So, looking globally, Europe, Asia and China are all fertile
ground in which our companies

[SIDENOTE]

"WE DEFINE A QUALITY GROWTH COMPANY AS ONE EXHIBITING SUPERIOR, LONG-TERM
EARNINGS GROWTH COMBINED WITH A PROVEN AND SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
FROM A MARKET/BRAND POSITION, PROPRIETARY PRODUCT OR TECHNOLOGY POSITION, OR A
UNIQUE ASSET BASE."

                                                                  JOHN JOSTRAND,
                                                                   WILLIAM BLAIR

                                       14
<Page>

can grow. A good example of this is eBay in Germany over the last three years.
eBay has created an absolutely huge business, despite a sluggish German economy.

    In most cases, our portfolio companies are either in the process of
establishing operations overseas and starting to grow very rapidly, or they've
been so successful domestically they just haven't had the time to expand
offshore. So, for us, globalization offers more upside than downside. Our
portfolio companies tend not to be big and mature enough for foreign competition
to represent a threat to their growth. And, typically, their market share in
foreign countries is still low, as they are just getting established.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): The upside of globalization is the
marked expansion of revenue opportunities for our companies in the All-Star
Growth Fund. In the portion of the Fund that we manage, the share of portfolio
companies' revenue generated by customers outside North America ranges up to 65
percent. In a broader sense, growth rates are higher in countries where the
standard of living is rising. Increased per capita income and GDP are the chief
benefits of globalization and we believe corporate activity is an important
contributor to improved living standards.

    The downside to globalization is the clash of cultures. In spite of a
so-called shrinking world - due to the ease of communication and travel -
distance may contribute to misunderstanding and, therefore, failed investments.
New competitors are another downside, but one that is more easily analyzed than
culture clash or misunderstood government policies in distant lands. We believe
that the best protection to the downside of globalization is in the adage
"travel broadens the mind." Fortunately, this is very near to our basic research
philosophy, which can be expressed as, "Get out there and find out what's going
on and speak directly to people who are in the middle of the issues." Our firm
is fortunate to have several people doing excellent work globally.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: THE MANAGERS' CONSENSUS IS THAT THE FUND IS POSITIONED TO
BENEFIT MORE FROM GLOBALIZATION THAN IT IS TO BE HARMED BY IT. WE WOULD AGREE.

LAMCO: What issue or potential problem most concerns you going forward? And the
reverse: what are you most sanguine about? Let's stay with you, John Jostrand,
and then ask Doug Foreman and Matt Weatherbie to comment.

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): The most concerning economic
development is the decline of more than 28 percent over the past two years in
the trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar. The current exchange level is about
in the middle of the range before the bubble in U.S. technology stocks (i.e.,
the 10 years ended 1996), so our concern is mild for the moment. The decline in
the currency, paired with the revival in gold prices, has us watchful about
valuations for U.S. equities.

    On a positive note, with the consensus view that the economic cycle has
entered mid-stream, there is less controversy about the earnings outlook. The
indicators that we, as stock pickers, watch are positive for continued earnings
growth. The yield curve is positive and commodity prices are up, signaling the
return of corporate pricing power. Our portfolio characteristics remain in clear
harmony with our philosophy of owning quality growth companies. The moderate
beta and volatility characteristics of quality investments had their predictable

[SIDENOTE]

"FOR US, GLOBALIZATION OFFERS MORE UPSIDE THAN DOWNSIDE. THE AREAS IN WHICH WE
INVEST - INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH CARE, SPECIALTY RETAIL AND MEDIA - ARE THE
VERY AREAS WHERE THE U.S. TENDS TO BE IN A GLOBAL COMPETITIVE LEAD."

                                                                   DOUG FOREMAN,
                                                                             TCW

effects in a recovery year such as 2003, but the moderate portfolio turnover
William Blair typically exhibits was highlighted in some academic research as a
proven long-term element in good investor returns. A mid-stream year, cyclically
speaking, should give William Blair portfolios - and quality in general - an
advantage as lower quality companies dominated in the early stages of the market
recovery in 2003.

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): The one thing I'm a little bit concerned about
is that the consensus of opinion regarding the economic outlook is one of the
tightest that I've seen in my investing career. By that, I mean the evidence of
recovery has been so overwhelming that even bearish investors have had to cave
in. At year-end 2003, there was a tight consensus that it had been a very good
year of recovery and that '04 is highly likely to be more of the same. I agree
with that - and that's what makes me a little nervous. Slightly more divergence
would be better, because divergence usually represents a better opportunity to
make money. You'll get somewhat different views as to what the tight consensus
outlook for the economy means for the stock market. My gut instincts tell me
there will be some surprises - there always are.

    The same thing that makes me nervous also makes me feel good - namely the
ongoing recovery and projected strength in the economy. I feel that we are still
in the fairly early innings of the recovery, to use a baseball analogy. We're
not in the first inning any more, but we're still in the second, third or fourth
- - somewhere in that area. So, it feels to me like we're still in the early
stages of the recovery and it would be highly unusual with the elections coming
up for us to lose this head of steam that we've built up. Anything can happen,
as we've learned the hard way. But, barring some unusual event, things should
continue to get better and the stock market should continue to rise. At the same
rate as '03? Probably not, but I think we have a good year ahead of us. The
other thing I feel good about is that, unlike investors who lagged the market,
better quality companies should do better this year. Lower quality companies
always outperform at the beginning of a bull market. And, I don't think there
are excesses in the market, despite the positive year that we had.

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): The issue that most concerns me
at present is the size of the federal budget deficit. Fiscal restraint needs to
be reestablished in Washington. Even if it is, it is unclear to me whether the
Bush tax cuts - which are very good for stock market investors - can be made
permanent, or whether future significant tax increases are likely, which would
depress economic growth and the market's potential.

    I am most sanguine about the prospect for accelerating economic growth
worldwide in 2004. This, combined with the impressive productivity improvements
that U.S. businesses have been demonstrating, will lead to strong corporate
profit growth, rising employment and, in my opinion, another year of positive
equity returns in 2004. It should be noted that the fourth year of a
presidential term has traditionally been a good one for the stock market.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: CONSENSUS ISN'T PERFECT. AS DOUG FOREMAN SAYS, "ANYTHING CAN
HAPPEN, AS WE'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY." THE MANAGERS WILL NOT STRAY FROM THEIR
STRATEGY AND CAPITALIZATION FOCUS, BUT THEY CLEARLY HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO
FINE-TUNE THE PORTFOLIO, DEPENDING ON DEVELOPMENTS, AND MONITOR THE LARGER
TRENDS THAT COULD IMPACT THE STOCK MARKET.

LAMCO: Name one stock that you have added recently to the portion of the
All-Star Growth Fund portfolio that you manage and why you added it. Doug
Foreman, what does TCW like?

FOREMAN (TCW - MID-CAP GROWTH): Eon Labs is a smaller generic drug company that
we believe is well positioned for growth. The number of prescription drugs
coming off patent in the next five years represents billions of dollars in
revenue and this company has done a good job of being the first to file for a
number of generic products over the past four years. Eon Labs also enjoys good
revenue diversity by going to market with more than 100 drugs, which is
important because generic drugs can come and go. The company has a tremendous
growth record - 30 percent plus on the top and bottom lines over the past few
years. It's a well managed company and it has numerous products in the pipeline
for approval over the next 12 to 18 months.

LAMCO: John Jostrand, what has William Blair added to the portfolio?

JOSTRAND (WILLIAM BLAIR - LARGE-CAP GROWTH): Our most recent purchase is
actually an addition to an existing position - EMC. This is a data storage
company in which the original thesis of growing demand for storage capacity,
modular additions to capacity and the increasing complexity of storage
management continues to strengthen. Management has shown an ability to adapt to
customers' shifting priorities through recent product developments, additional
distribution channels and strategic partnering - all of which has improved its
competitive position. Lastly, the company made three important acquisitions that
bring greater value to its customer base and greater distribution clout for the
acquired companies.

LAMCO: Matt Weatherbie, what have you focused on recently?

WEATHERBIE (M.A. WEATHERBIE - SMALL-CAP GROWTH): A company that we recently
added is Universal Technical Institute (UTI), the leading provider of
post-secondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive
technicians. The company works closely with leading original equipment
manufacturers to continuously refine and expand its program. As a result, it is
often the sole provider of manufacturer-based training programs. There is a
shortage of 60,000 auto techs in the U.S., primarily because of rapid
technological advancement and an aging workforce. For example, an auto these
days can have up to 42 microprocessors in it. UTI fits our criteria: it has high
growth, an excellent return on invested capital, strong cash flow generation, a
market leadership position, long-tenured and stable management team, a strong
balance sheet and significant growth potential.

LAMCO PERSPECTIVE: THE MANAGERS' RECENT PURCHASES OR ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING
POSITIONS CLEARLY REFLECT THEIR CAPITALIZATION FOCUS. SINCE THE RESTRUCTURING OF
THE FUND OVER THREE YEARS AGO AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CURRENT INVESTMENT
MANAGER LINE-UP, EACH MANAGER HAS CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED ITS RESPECTIVE
STRATEGY AND CAPITALIZATION FOCUS, AS LAMCO INTENDED.

"WE SUMMARIZE 2003 AS A DRAMATIC STEP BACK FROM THE BRINK. MANY COMPANIES
EXPERIENCED THEIR FIRST POSITIVE FINANCIAL TRENDS IN THREE YEARS, AND THE GLOBAL
POLITICAL/TERROR PICTURE IMPROVED MARKEDLY."

INVESTMENT GROWTH as of December 31, 2003

GROWTH OF A $10,000 INVESTMENT

The graph below illustrates the growth of a $10,000 investment assuming purchase
of common stock at the closing market price (NYSE: ASG) of $9.25 on December 31,
1996, and tracking its progress through December 31, 2003. This 7-year period
covers the calendar years since the Fund commenced its 10 percent distribution
policy in 1997.

[CHART]

The dark green region of the graph above reflects the growth of the investment
assuming all distributions were received in cash and not reinvested back in the
Fund. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to $15,308 (this
value includes distributions per share totaling $7.33 during the period).

    The light green region of the graph depicts additional value realized
through reinvestment of all distributions and participation in all the rights
offerings under the terms of each offering. On three occasions, the Fund has
conducted rights offerings that allow shareholders to purchase additional shares
at a discount. The value of the investment under this scenario grew to
$16,594.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.'s current policy, in effect since 1997, is to
pay distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net
asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent of
the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the
Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. THE FIXED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FUND'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME OR NET REALIZED
CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND MAY BE TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME UP TO THE AMOUNT OF
THE FUND'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS. If, for any calendar
year, the total distributions made under the 10 percent pay-out policy exceed
the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will
generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the
shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment
income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed
under the 10 percent pay-out policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and
not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the
extent of such excess.

                                 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2003

I. ORGANIZATION

Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a Maryland corporation
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended, as
a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.

FUND SHARES

The Fund may issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 par.

II. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price at the close of the
principal exchange on which they trade. Unlisted securities or listed securities
for which there were no sales during the day are valued at the closing bid price
on such exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

    Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service approved by the
Fund's Board of Directors, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-sized trading units of similar securities. The services may use
various pricing techniques, which will take into account appropriate factors
such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading
characteristics and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for
which quotes are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange
bid quotation.

    Short-term debt obligations maturing in more than 60 days for which market
quotations are readily available are valued at current market value. Short-term
debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

    Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued
at fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures
approved by and under the general supervision of the Board of Directors.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with institutions that
the Fund's investment advisor has determined are creditworthy. The Fund, through
its custodian, receives delivery of underlying securities collateralizing a
repurchase agreement. Collateral is at least equal, at all times, to the value
of the repurchase obligation including interest. A repurchase agreement
transaction involves certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the
counterparty. These risks include possible delays or restrictions upon the
Fund's ability to dispose of the underlying securities and a possible decline in
the value of the underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
assert its rights.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions
and dividend income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

Consistent with the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable income to shareholders, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund currently has a policy of paying distributions on its common shares
totaling approximately 10% of its net asset value per year. The distributions
are payable in four quarterly distributions of 2.5% of the Fund's net asset
value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday prior to each
quarterly declaration date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on
ex-date.

The timing and character of income and capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
Reclassifications are made to the Fund's capital accounts for permanent tax
differences to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available
capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.

    For the year ended December 31, 2003, permanent differences resulting
primarily from differing treatments for net operating losses, return of capital
and excess distributions were identified and reclassified among the components
of the Fund's net assets as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
  ACCUMULATED NET       ACCUMULATED
  INVESTMENT LOSS    NET REALIZED LOSS    PAID-IN CAPITAL
  ---------------    -----------------    ---------------
      <S>                  <C>              <C>
      $ 1,229,500          $ 7,098,748      $ (8,328,248)
</Table>

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses), as disclosed on the
Statement of Operations, and net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002 was as follows:

</Table>

*For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions, if any, are considered
ordinary income distributions.

    As of December 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>

              $ --              $ --        $  22,865,068
</Table>

*The differences between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized appreciation
are primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales.

    The following capital loss carryforwards are available to reduce taxable
income arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the
extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

<Table>
<Caption>
              YEAR OF            CAPITAL LOSS

               <S>               <C>
               2009              $  5,781,653
               2010                11,242,729
                                 ------------
                                 $ 17,024,382
</Table>

Future realized gains offset by the loss carryforwards are not required to be
distributed to shareholders. However, under the Fund's distribution policy, as
described above, such gains may be distributed to shareholders in the year gains
are realized. Any such gains distributed may be taxable to shareholders as
ordinary income. Capital loss carryforwards of $7,098,726 were utilized during
the year ended December 31, 2003.

IV.  FEES AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE

Liberty Asset Management Company ("LAMCO"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Columbia Management Group, Inc. ("Columbia"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, is the investment advisor of the Fund.
LAMCO receives a monthly fee based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at
the following annual rates:

<Table>

         Over $300 million                0.72%
</Table>

Under Portfolio Manager Agreements, LAMCO pays each Portfolio Manager a

they manage. The portfolio management fee is paid from the investment advisory
fees collected by LAMCO and is based on the Fund's average weekly net assets at
the following annual rates:

<Table>

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES

LAMCO is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the Fund
under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), LAMCO has delegated those functions to State Street
Corporation ("State Street"). LAMCO pays the total fees collected from the Fund
for these services to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement.

    Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Fund, LAMCO receives
from the Fund an annual flat fee of $10,000 paid monthly, and in any month that
the Fund's average weekly net assets exceed $50 million, an additional monthly
fee. The additional fee rate is calculated by taking into account the fees
payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. This rate is applied to
the average daily net assets of the Fund for that month. The Fund also pays
additional fees for pricing services. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
effective pricing and bookkeeping fee rate was 0.031%.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. The Fund could have invested a portion of the
assets utilized in connection with the expense offset arrangement in an income
producing asset if it had not entered into such an agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS

The Fund pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF LIBERTY ALL-STAR GROWTH FUND,
INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the investment portfolio, and the related statements of operations and changes
in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2003, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. The financial highlights of the Fund for periods prior to January
1, 1999 were audited by other independent accountants whose report dated
February 12, 1999 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

        AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT & CASH PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)

Each shareholder of the Fund will automatically be a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan as amended June 30, 1996
(the "Plan"), unless the shareholder specifically elects otherwise by writing to
the agent for participants in the Plan, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan
Agent"), P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010 or by calling 1-800-LIB-FUND
(1-800-542-3863). Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a brokerage
firm, bank or other nominee must notify their brokerage firm, bank or nominee if
they do not wish to participate in the Plan.

    Under the Plan, all dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund
are automatically reinvested by the Plan Agent in additional shares of the Fund.
Distributions declared payable in shares or cash at the option of shareholders
are paid to participants in the Plan entirely in newly issued full and
fractional shares valued at the lower of market value or net asset value per
share on the valuation date for the distribution (but not a discount of more
than 5 percent from market price). Distributions declared payable only in cash
will be reinvested for the accounts of participants in the Plan in additional
shares purchased by the Plan Agent on the open market at prevailing market
prices. If, prior to the Plan Agent's completion of such open market purchases,
the market price of a share equals or exceeds its net asset value, the remainder
of the distribution will be paid in newly issued shares valued at net asset
value (but not at a discount of more than 5 percent from market price).
Dividends and distributions are subject to taxation, whether received in cash or
in shares.

    Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
in any amount from $100 to $3,000 on a monthly basis for investment in shares of
the Fund purchased on the open market. These voluntary cash payments will be
invested on or about the 15th day of each calendar month, and voluntary payments
should be sent so as to be received by the Plan Agent no later than 10 days
before the next investment date. Barring suspension of trading, voluntary cash
payments will be invested within 45 days of receipt. A participant may withdraw
a voluntary cash payment by written notice received by the Plan Agent at least
48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

    The Plan Agent maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmations of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

    There is no charge to participants for reinvesting distributions pursuant to
the Plan. The Plan Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. There are no brokerage
charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of
dividends or distributions declared payable in shares or in cash. However, each
participant bears a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of distributions declared payable only in cash.

    With respect to purchases from voluntary cash payments, the Plan Agent will
charge $1.25 for each such purchase for a participant, plus a pro rata share of
the brokerage commissions. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts of
shares for individual accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than the
usual brokerage charges for such transactions, as the Plan Agent will be
purchasing shares for all participants in blocks and prorating the lower
commission thus attainable.

    Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
other nominee will be able to participate in the Plan only if their brokerage
firm, bank or nominee is able to do so on their behalf. Shareholders
participating in the Plan through a brokerage firm may not be able to transfer
their shares to another brokerage firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

    Shareholders may terminate their participation in the Plan by written notice
to the Plan Agent, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010. Such termination will be effective immediately if received not less
than 10 days prior to the record date for a dividend or distribution; otherwise
it will be effective on the first business day after the payment date of such
dividend or distribution. On termination, participants may either have
certificates for the Fund shares in their Plan accounts delivered to them or
have the Plan Agent sell such shares in the open market and deliver the
proceeds, less a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commissions, to the participant.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

     (a)  The registrant has, as of the end of the period covered by this
          report, adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
          principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
          accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
          functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed
          by the registrant or a third party.

     (b)  During the period covered by this report, there were not any
          amendments to a provision of the code of ethics adopted in 2(a)
          above.

     (c)  During the period covered by this report, there were not any
          waivers or implicit waivers to a provision of the code of ethics
          adopted in 2(a) above.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Audit Committee is composed of three of the registrant's
independent directors who are not affiliated with the registrant's investment
adviser.  The Board has determined that each of the audit committee members
is "financially literate" and that at least one member has "accounting or
related financial management expertise" as used in the New York Stock
Exchange definitions of the terms.

     Under the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if the Board of
Directors has not determined that a "financial expert," a new term based on
criteria contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is serving on the audit
committee, it must disclose this fact and explain why the committee does not
have such an expert.  The Board of Directors has determined that none of the
members of its audit committee meets the technical requirements of the
definition.  Moreover, it believes that for the following reasons it is not
necessary for a registered investment company such as the registrant, with an
audit committee that meets the New York Stock Exchange requirements of
financial literacy, to have a "financial expert" as a member of the committee.

     1.  The financial statements of and accounting principles applying to
         registered investment companies such as the registrant are relatively
         straightforward and transparent compared to those of operating
         companies. The significant accounting issues are valuation of
         securities and other assets (regulated under the Investment Company Act
         of 1940 (the "1940 Act") and computed daily), accrual of expenses,
         allocation of joint expenses shared with other entities, such as
         insurance premiums, and disclosures of all related party transactions.
         Equally important is a knowledge of the tax laws applying to registered
         investment companies.  None of the accounting issues involving
         corporate America that have received recent publicity, such as
         sophisticated derivative transactions and special purpose entities,
         are present in financial reporting for registered investment companies.

<Page>

     2.  During the years that the registrant has been filing financial reports
         under the 1940 Act since its inception in 1986 there has never been a
         requirement for a financial report or statement to be restated.

     3.  The current members of the audit committee have many years of aggregate
         experience serving on this audit committee and in the Board's judgment,
         through this experience and experience with other public corporation's
         financial affairs, they have an understanding of the relevant generally
         accepted accounting principles governing the registrant's financial
         statements, tax laws applying to the registrant, the registrant's
         internal accounting controls and audit committee functions necessary to
         satisfy the objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the
         financial statements, auditing process and internal controls of the
         registrant.

     4.  The audit committee has the capability of employing a consultant who
         satisfies the technical definition of a "financial expert" and will
         do so from time to time if circumstances warrant.

(e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Audit Committee of the registrant has adopted a formal policy (the
"Policy") which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to
which the Audit Committee will pre-approve (i) all audit and non-audit
(including audit related, tax and all other) services  provided by the
registrant's independent auditor to the registrant and individual funds
(collectively "Fund Services"), and (ii) all non-audit services provided by
the registrant's independent auditor to the funds' adviser or a control
affiliate of the adviser, that relate directly to the funds' operations and
financial reporting (collectively "Fund-related Adviser Services").  A
"control affiliate" is an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the funds, and the
term "adviser" is deemed to exclude any unaffiliated sub-adviser whose role
is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by
another investment adviser.

The Audit Committee uses a combination of specific (on a case-by-case basis
as potential services are contemplated) and general (pre-determined list of
permitted services) pre-approvals.  Unless a type of service has received
general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit
Committee if it is to be provided by the independent auditor.

The Policy does not delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to
pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURES

On an annual basis, the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee
Administration shall submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of
Fund Services and Fund-related Adviser Services that are subject to general
pre-approval.

<Page>

These services will provide a description of each type of service that is
subject to general pre-approval and, where possible, will provide projected
fees for each instance of providing each service.  This general pre-approval
and related fees (where provided) will generally cover the period from July 1
through June 30 of the following year.  The Audit Committee will review and
approve the types of services and review the projected fees for the next
fiscal year and may add to, or subtract from, the list of general
pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.
This approval acknowledges that the Audit Committee is in agreement with the
specific types of services that the independent auditor will be permitted to
perform.  The fee amounts will be updated to the extent necessary at other
regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee.

In addition to the fees for each individual service, the Audit Committee has
the authority to implement a fee cap on the aggregate amount of non-audit
services provided to an individual fund.

If, subsequent to general pre-approval, a fund, adviser or control affiliate
determines that it would like to engage the independent auditor to perform a
service not included in the general pre-approval list, the specific
pre-approval procedure shall be as follows:

     -  A brief written request shall be prepared by management detailing the
        proposed engagement with explanation as to why the work is proposed
        to be performed by the independent auditor;

     -  The request should be addressed to the Audit Committee with copies to
        the Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration;

     -  The Fund Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will
        arrange for a discussion of the service to be included on the agenda
        for the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, when the
        Committee will discuss the proposed engagement and approve or deny
        the request.

     -  If the timing of the project is critical and the project needs to
        commence before the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairperson
        of the Audit Committee may approve or deny the request on behalf of
        the Audit Committee, or, in the Chairperson's discretion, determine
        to call a special meeting of the Audit Committee for the purpose of
        considering the proposal.  Should the Chairperson of the Audit
        Committee be unavailable, any other member of the Audit Committee
        may serve as an alternate for the purpose of approving or denying
        the request.  Discussion with the Chairperson (or alternate, if
        necessary) will be arranged by the Fund Treasurer and/or Director
        of Trustee Administration.  The independent auditor will not
        commence any such project unless and until specific approval has
        been given.

III. ADDITIONAL PRE-APPROVAL INFORMATION

The engagement of the independent auditor to provide Fund Services and
Fund-related Adviser Services shall be approved by the Audit Committee prior
to the commencement of any such engagement.

<Page>

     A.  AUDIT SERVICES TO THE FUNDS

The Audit Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement throughout the
year and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in terms and conditions
resulting from changes in audit scope, fund structure or other items.

     B.  AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES TO THE FUNDS

The Audit Committee believes that the provision of Audit-related Services is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, and will grant
general pre-approval to specific Audit-related Services.

     C.  TAX SERVICES TO THE FUNDS

The Audit Committee will grant general pre-approval to those specific Tax
services that have historically been provided by the auditor, that the Audit
Committee has reviewed and believes would not impair the independence of the
auditor, and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     D.  ALL OTHER SERVICES TO THE FUNDS

The Audit Committee will grant general pre-approval to those specific
permissible non-audit services classified as All Other Services that it
believes are routine and recurring services, would not impair the
independence of the auditor and are consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence.

     E.  FUND-RELATED ADVISER SERVICES

The Audit Committee will grant general pre-approval to provide specific
non-audit services to the funds' investment adviser, or any control
affiliates, that relate directly to the funds' operations and financial
statements. This includes services customarily required by one or more
adviser entities or control affiliates in the ordinary course of their
operations.

     F.  CERTAIN OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO ADVISER ENTITIES

The Audit Committee recognizes that there are cases where services proposed
to be provided by the independent auditor to the adviser or control
affiliates are not Fund-related Adviser Services within the meaning of the
Policy, but nonetheless may be relevant to the Audit Committee's ongoing
evaluation of the auditor's independence and objectivity with respect to its
audit services to the funds.  As a result, in all cases where an adviser or
control affiliate engages the independent auditor to provide audit or
non-audit services that are not Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser
Services, were not subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee, and the
projected fees for any such engagement (or the aggregate of all such
engagements) exceeds a pre-determined

<Page>

threshold established by the Audit Committee, the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and/or Director of Trustee Administration will notify the Audit
Committee not later than its next meeting.  Such notification shall include a
general description of the services provided, the entity that is to be the
recipient of such services, the timing of the engagement, the entity's
reasons for selecting the independent auditor, and the projected fees.  Such
information will allow the Audit Committee to consider whether non-audit
services provided to the adviser and Adviser Entities, which were not subject
to Audit Committee pre-approval, are compatible with maintaining the
auditor's independence.

IV.  REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Fund Treasurer or Director of Trustee Administration shall report to the
Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings regarding all Fund Services
or Fund-related Adviser Services initiated since the last such report was
rendered, including:

     -  A general description of the services, and

     -  Actual billed and projected fees, and

     -  The means by which such Fund Services or Fund-related Adviser
        Services were approved by the Audit Committee.

In addition, in accordance with Section 208-5 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, the independent auditor shall report to the Audit Committee annually,
and no more than 90 days prior to the filing of audit reports with the SEC,
all non-audit services provided to entities in the funds' "investment company
complex," as defined by SEC rules.  In addition, the independent auditor must
annually disclose to the Audit Committee all relationships with the funds of
which the independent auditor is aware that may be reasonably thought to bear
on the auditor's independence.  The independent auditor shall tabulate,
calculate and disclose its fees annually for such relationships.

V.  AMENDMENTS; ANNUAL APPROVAL BY AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Policy may be amended from time to time by the Audit Committee.  Prompt
notice of any amendments will be provided to the independent auditor, Fund
Treasurer and Director of Trustee Administration.  The Policy shall be
reviewed and approved at least annually by the Audit Committee.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002 are disclosed in 4(b)-(d) above.

All non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for services
rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted
with or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the

<Page>

adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 are also disclosed in 4(b)-(d)
above.  There were no such fees during the last two fiscal years.

(h) The registrant's Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to
the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.  The Audit Committee determined that the provision
of such services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable at this time.

ITEM 6.  RESERVED.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Fund has delegated to Liberty Asset Management Company (the "Advisor")
the responsibility to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by
the Fund. In deciding to delegate this responsibility to the Advisor, the
Board of Trustees of the Trust reviewed and approved the policies and
procedures adopted by the Advisor. These included the procedures that the
Advisor follows when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of the
Fund and its shareholders and the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients
or other persons.

The Advisor's policy is to vote all proxies for Fund securities in a manner
considered by the Advisor to be in the best interest of the Fund and its
shareholders without regard to any benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates,
its other clients or other persons.  The Advisor examines each proposal and
votes against the proposal, if, in its judgment, approval or adoption of the
proposal would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential
market value of the issuer's securities. The Advisor also examines each
proposal and votes the proxies against the proposal, if, in its judgment, the
proposal would be expected to affect adversely the best interest of the Fund.
The Advisor determines the best interest of the Fund in light of the
potential economic return on the Fund's investment.

The Advisor addresses potential material conflicts of interest by having
predetermined voting guidelines.  For those proposals that require special
consideration or in instances where special circumstances may require varying
from the predetermined guideline, the Advisor's Proxy Committee determines
the vote in the best interest of the Fund, without consideration of any
benefit to the Advisor, its affiliates, its other clients or other persons. A
member of the Proxy Committee is prohibited from voting on any proposal for
which he or she has a conflict of interest by reason of a direct relationship
with the issuer or other party affected by a given proposal. Persons making
recommendations to the Proxy Committee or its members are required to

<Page>

disclose to the Committee any relationship with a party making a proposal or
other matter known to the person that would create a potential conflict of
interest.

The Advisor has three classes of proxy proposals. The first two classes are
predetermined guidelines to vote for or against specific proposals, unless
otherwise directed by the Proxy Committee.  The third class is for proposals
given special consideration by the Proxy Committee. In addition, the Proxy
Committee considers requests to vote on proposals in the first two classes
other than according to the predetermined guidelines.

The Advisor generally votes in favor of proposals related to the following
matters: selection of auditors (unless the auditor receives more than 50% of
its revenues from non-audit activities from the company and its affiliates),
election of directors (unless the proposal gives management the ability to
alter the size of the board without shareholder approval), different persons
for chairman of the board /chief executive officer (unless, in light of the
size of the company and the nature of its shareholder base, the role of
chairman and CEO are not held by different persons), compensation (if
provisions are consistent with standard business practices), debt limits
(unless proposed specifically as an anti-takeover action), indemnifications
(unless for negligence and or breaches of fiduciary duty), meetings,  name of
company, principal office (unless the purpose is to reduce regulatory or
financial supervision),  reports and accounts (if the certifications required
by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been provided), par value, shares (unless
proposed as an anti-takeover action), share repurchase programs, independent
committees, and equal opportunity employment.

The Advisor generally votes against proposals related to the following
matters: super majority voting, cumulative voting, preferred stock, warrants,
rights, poison pills, reclassification of common stock and meetings held by
written consent.

The Advisor gives the following matters special consideration: new proposals,
proxies of investment company shares (other than those covered by the
predetermined guidelines), mergers/acquisitions (proposals where a hostile
merger/acquisition is apparent or where the Advisor represents ownership in
more than one of the companies involved), shareholder proposals (other than
those covered by the predetermined guidelines), executive/director
compensation (other than those covered by the predetermined guidelines),
pre-emptive rights and proxies of international issuers which block
securities sales between submission of  a proxy and the meeting (proposals
for these securities are voted only on the specific instruction of the Proxy
Committee and to the extent practicable in accordance with predetermined
guidelines).

In addition, if a portfolio manager or other party involved with a client of
the Advisor or Fund account concludes that the interest of the client or Fund
requires that a proxy be voted on a proposal other than according to the
predetermined guidelines, he or she may request that the Proxy Committee
consider voting the proxy differently. If any person (or entity) requests the
Proxy Committee (or any of its members) to vote a proxy other than according
to a predetermined guideline, that person must furnish to the Proxy Committee
a written explanation of the reasons for the request and a description of the
person's (or entity's) relationship with the party proposing the matter to
shareholders or any other matter known to the person (or entity) that would
create a potential conflict of interest.

The Proxy Committee may vary from the predetermined guideline if it
determines that voting on the proposal according to the predetermined
guideline would be expected to impact adversely the current or potential
market value of the issuer's securities or to affect adversely the best
interest of the client.  References to the best interest of a client refer to
the interest of the client in terms of

<Page>

the potential economic return on the client's investment. In determining the
vote on any proposal, the Proxy Committee does not consider any benefit other
than benefits to the owner of the securities to be voted.

The Advisor's Proxy Committee is composed of operational and investment
representatives of its regional offices as well as senior representatives of
the Advisor's equity investments, equity research, compliance and legal
functions.  During the first quarter of each year, the Proxy Committee
reviews all guidelines and establishes guidelines for expected new proposals.
In addition to these reviews and its other responsibilities described above,
its functions include annual review of its Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures
to ensure consistency with internal policies and regulatory agency policies,
and development and modification of voting guidelines and procedures as it
deems appropriate or necessary.

The Advisor uses Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third party
vendor, to implement its proxy voting process.  ISS provides proxy analysis,
record keeping services and vote disclosure services.

COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

ITEM 9.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Not applicable at this time.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and principal
          financial officer, based on their evaluation of the registrant's
          disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days
          of the filing of this report, have concluded that such controls
          and procedures are adequately designed to ensure that information
          required to be disclosed by the registrant in Form N-CSR is
          accumulated and communicated to the registrant's management,
          including the principal executive officer and principal financial
          officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
          to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's last
          fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the
          case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.

                                                             Exhibit 99.Code Eth

                    COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT GROUP FAMILY OF FUNDS
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

     I.     COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

                 This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies
            within the Columbia Management Group fund complex (collectively the
            "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to the Funds' Principal
            Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting
            Officer, and Director of Trustee Administration (the "Covered
            Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

                 -  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling
                    of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal
                    and professional relationships;
                 -  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure
                    in reports and documents that a Fund files with, or submits
                    to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in
                    other public communications made by a Fund;
                 -  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                    regulations;
                 -  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to
                    an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
                 -  accountability for adherence to the Code.

                 Each Covered Officer shall adhere to a high standard of
            business ethics and shall be sensitive to situations that may give
            rise to actual or apparent conflicts of interest.

     II.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

                 .  The Boards of Trustees and Boards of Directors of the Funds
            (collectively, the "Board") shall designate an individual to be
            primarily responsible for the administration of the Code (the "Code
            Officer"). The Code shall be administered by the Columbia Management
            Group Compliance Department. In the absence of the Code Officer, his
            or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
            temporary basis.

                 Each Fund has designated a chief legal officer (the "Chief
            Legal Officer") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
            the rules promulgated thereunder. The Chief Legal Officer of a Fund
            shall assist the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code.
            The Chief Legal Officer shall be responsible for applying this Code
            to specific situations in which questions are presented under it (in
            consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and has the
            authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.
            However, any

            waivers sought by a Covered Officer must be approved by each Audit
            Committee of the Funds (collectively, the "Audit Committee").

     III.   MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                 OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
            Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or
            his/her service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest
            would arise if a Covered Officer, or a family member, receives
            improper personal benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's
            position with a Fund.

                 Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships
            between Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to
            conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of
            1940 (the "Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
            (the "Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not
            individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or
            sale of securities or other property) with a Fund because of their
            status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. A Fund's and its
            investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed
            to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of those provisions.
            This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace those
            programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the
            parameters of this Code.

                 Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
            personal benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
            contractual relationship between a Fund and its investment adviser,
            administrator, principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent
            and/or transfer agent (each, a "Service Provider") of which the
            Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
            Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course
            of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for a Service
            Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
            implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
            Service Provider and a Fund. The participation of the Covered
            Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
            relationship between the Fund and the Service Provider and is
            consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
            duties as officers of a Fund. In addition, it is recognized by the
            Board that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of
            one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
            codes.

                 Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if
            such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions of the
            Company Act and the Advisers Act. The following list provides
            examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered
            Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive.
            The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered
            Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of a
            Fund.

<Page>

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  not use personal influence or personal relationships
                    improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                    reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member would benefit personally to the
                    detriment of a Fund; and

                 -  not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
                    the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer or an
                    immediate family member rather than the benefit of the
                    Fund.(1).

                 There are some conflict of interest situations that must be
            approved by the Code Officer, after consultation with the Chief
            Legal Officer. Those situations include, but are not limited to,:

                 -  service as director on the board of any public or private
                    company;
                 -  the receipt of any gifts in excess of $100 in the aggregate
                    from a third party that does or seeks to do business with
                    the Funds during any 12-month period;
                 -  the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which
                    a Fund has current or prospective business dealings, unless
                    such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
                    appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                    raise any question of impropriety;
                 -  any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or
                    employment relationship with, any Fund service providers,
                    other than its investment adviser, principal underwriter,
                    administrator or any affiliated person thereof;
                 -  a direct or indirect material financial interest in
                    commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund
                    for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or
                    redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the
                    Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity
                    ownership.

     IV.    DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

                 Each Covered Officer shall:

                 -  be familiar with the disclosure requirements generally
                    applicable to the Funds;

- ----------
(1) For purposes of this Code, personal trading activity of the Covered Officers
shall be monitored in accordance with the Columbia Management Group Code of
Ethics. Each Covered Officer shall be considered an "Access Person" under such
Code. The term "immediate family" shall have the same meaning as provided in
such Code.

<Page>

                 -  not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
                    facts about any Fund to others, whether within or outside
                    the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors, and
                    to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
                    organizations;
                 -  to the extent appropriate within his/her area of
                    responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
                    the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting full,
                    fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
                    reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the
                    SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds;
                    and
                 -  promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
                    imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

     V.     REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

                 Each Covered Officer must:

                 -  upon adoption of the Code (or after becoming a Covered
                    Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he/she has
                    received, read and understands the Code;
                 -  annually affirm to the Board compliance with the
                    requirements of the Code;
                 -  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                    employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                    reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                 -  notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Code Officer promptly
                    if he/she knows of any violation of this Code; and
                 -  respond to the trustee and officer questionnaires circulated
                    periodically in connection with the preparation of
                    disclosure documents for the Funds.

                 The Code Officer shall maintain records of all activities
            related to this Code.

                 The Funds will follow the procedures set forth below in
            investigating and enforcing this Code:

                 -  The Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code Officer will take
                    all appropriate action to investigate any potential
                    violation reported to him/her;
                 -  If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer and
                    the Code Officer believes that no violation has occurred,
                    the Code Officer will notify the person(s) reporting the
                    potential violation, and no further action is required;
                 -  Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer and/or the Code
                    Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the
                    Audit Committee;

<Page>

                 -  If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has
                    occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the
                    Board, which will consider appropriate action, which may
                    include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                    applicable policies and procedures; notification to the
                    Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Management Group; or a
                    recommendation to sanction or dismiss the Covered Officer;
                 -  The Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers
                    in its sole discretion;
                 -  Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                    required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

                 The Chief Legal Officer shall:

                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any approvals
                    provided in accordance with Section III of this Code; and
                 -  report to the Audit Committee quarterly any violations of,
                    or material issues arising under, this Code.

     VI.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                 This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds
            for the purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
            rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies
            thereunder. Insofar as other polices or procedures of the Funds or
            the Funds' Service Providers govern or purport to govern the
            behavior or activities (including, but not limited to, personal
            trading activities) of the Covered Officers who are subject to this
            Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
            overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and
            their investment advisers' and principal underwriter's codes of
            ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Company Act and any policies and
            procedures of the Service Providers are separate requirements
            applicable to the Covered Officers and are not part of this Code.

     VII.   AMENDMENTS

                 All material amendments to this Code must be approved or
            ratified by the Board, including a majority of independent
            directors.

     VIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

                 All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this
            Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and
            protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this
            Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
            Board, the Covered Officers, the Chief Legal Officer, the Code
            Officer, outside audit firms and legal counsel to the Funds, and
            senior management of Columbia Management Group.

     IX.    INTERNAL USE

                 The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds
            and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund,
            as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

    (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
         other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
         internal control over financial reporting.
