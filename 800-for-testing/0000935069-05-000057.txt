LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               December 15, 2004
Dear Shareholders,
   We are pleased to report that for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, The
Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc.'s total return based on net asset value per
share rose 35.2% in US dollar terms. The fund's  benchmark,  the new index blend
of 45% in Central Europe (CECE-Index),  45% Russia (RTX-Index) and 10% in Turkey
(ISE National 30), rose 32.7% during the same period.  The Central  European and
Russia region continued to outperform  developed  markets:  for the same period,
the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index rose 7.6%, and the Morgan Stanley  Capital
International (MSCI) Europe Index rose 20.3% in US dollar terms.
   The fund's strong outperformance was due to both country allocation and stock
selection.  In Russia,  high energy prices  continued to support the economy and
helped generate record revenue flows.  Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 7.6%
year-over-year  (y-o-y)  during the first half of calendar 2004, and despite the
economic slowdown in the third quarter,  the Russian  government's 2004 year-end
forecasts  still  call for  growth  to come in at 6.8%.  With  foreign  exchange
reserves  surpassing  the $100  billion  mark,  and the  budget  surplus  almost
doubling  to $12  billion in the first half of the  calendar  year,  this strong
macroeconomic  setting and record  company  earnings  paced the market.  Central
Europe was the fund's best  performing  region,  buoyed by strong GDP growth and
modest  inflationary  pressure,  despite higher energy prices.  The economies of
Hungary,  Poland and the Czech Republic have all seen strong external demand and
a high level of foreign  investment.  All three nations are taking an aggressive
fiscal and monetary approach in order to meet the criteria to enter the European
Union  (EU) and  adopt the  euro,  which  bodes  well for  long-term  investment
prospects.  In Hungary,  the National Bank has  aggressively  cut interest rates
over the course of the year,  and is  expected  to  continue to do so as long as
inflation  levels remain  modest.  The strength of the forint and a stellar crop
harvest  have helped to mitigate the impact of higher oil prices and lowered the
consumer  price  index  (CPI).  In  Poland,  the  fiscal  environment  improved,
inflation levels dropped, and the political environment stabilized,  all helping
to attract investors during the period.  Industrial production was also a strong
point,  driven in part by high foreign demand for exports.  After lackluster GDP
growth in 2003, the Czech economy  rebounded with its highest  quarterly rate of
growth  in  three  years at 4.1%  y-o-y  during  the  second  calendar  quarter.
Particularly  encouraging was the high increase in fixed capital  formation from
9.6% to 12.8% in the  first  calendar  quarter,  which  is a good  indicator  of
sustaining GDP growth.
   As previously  reported,  in April,  the fund initiated a position in Turkey,
where  we  believe  there  is a  strong  long-term  investment  opportunity.  In
preparation for possible entry into the EU, Turkey  underwent  various levels of
reform and met the fiscal, political and social criteria for membership talks to
begin. A specific date is expected to be announced at the December 17 EU summit.
This was a catalyst for increased  foreign direct  investment (FDI) and improved
transparency, making for a clearer and more stable macroeconomic environment. In
addition,  dynamic  export growth and a healthy  fiscal climate helped to expand
the  economy  by 12.5%  during  the first  half of 2004.  Coupled  with  current
inflation  levels (which are at historically low levels and are expected to meet
year-end  targets),  all make for an  attractive  investment  case.  The current
account  deficit remains a concern and is expected to come in at more than 4% of
GDP for calendar 2004.
   The Central  Europe and Russia  Fund's  discount to net asset value  averaged
12.6% during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, compared with 13.9% for the
same period last year.
   Sincerely,

Index returns assume  reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Fund returns, do not
reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Investments in funds involve risks including the loss of principal.

This  Fund  is  not  diversified  and  may  focus  its  investments  in  certain
geographical  regions,  thereby  increasing its vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic  changes and market  risks.  This may result in greater share price
volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the fund.  Therefore,  the fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:  BEGINNING IN 2005, THE TURKISH LIRA WILL LOSE SIX ZEROS AND THE NEW CURRENCY
WILL BE DENOTED AS NEW TURKISH LIRA. WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THE  RE-DENOMINATION
OF THE CURRENCY?

A:  The  inflationary  process,  which  began in  Turkey  in the  1970s,  forced
everybody to learn digits used in  astrophysics.  Economic values were expressed
in terms of billions,  trillions and even  quadrillions.  The cash demand in the
economy  was met by new  banknotes  in larger  denominations,  which were put to
circulation  almost every two years beginning in 1981. The enormous figures with
all the zeros led to a variety of problems, including challenges for accounting,
information  technology  and  statistical  recordkeeping.  As a  result  of  the
significant  decline in inflation from chronically high levels, and the steadily
rising  confidence in the Lira, the decision to  re-denominate  the currency was
presented  as part of a  tight  economic  program  backed  by the  International
Monetary Fund. As a result, the government passed legislation that envisions the
re-denomination  of the currency by December 31, 2004.  This move could not only
ease dealing with and interpreting  astronomical  numbers,  but should raise the
credibility of the national currency.

Q: WILL THE RE-DENOMINATION CAUSE INFLATION?

A: The  re-denomination  of the Lira  should not have any  noticeable  effect on
inflation, as the operation is simply a zero-removal process. The only potential
effect on the  general  level of prices  could be the  rounding  up (or down) of
prices  post-re-denomination.  Furthermore, the requirement to express prices of
all goods and  services  in terms of both the  Turkish  Lira and the New Turkish
Lira  should  help to  avoid  the  exploitation  of the  potential  rounding  up
possibilities,  especially  given  the  increasingly  competitive  nature of the
domestic market.

Q: WITH OIL PRICES  STILL  HOVERING AT NEAR RECORD  LEVELS,  THERE IS AN ONGOING
DISCUSSION  AMONG POLICY MAKERS  REGARDING  THE FUTURE OF THE OIL  STABILIZATION
FUND IN  RUSSIA.  COULD  YOU  PLEASE  GIVE US AN  UPDATE  REGARDING  THE  LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS?

A:  The  enabling  legislation  for the  stabilization  fund  set a core  sum of
RUB500bn to be first built up, then indefinitely maintained, and only drawn down
to smooth  public  spending  in the event of the Urals oil price  falling  below
$20/bbl.  Based  on  the  government's  oil  price  forecasts  at the  time  the
legislation was drafted, up to three years would have been required to amass the
core sum. However, at the end of October, the oil stabilization fund had reached
RUB400bn,  and is currently  expected to reach the RUB500bn  target in December,
less  than a year  after  the  fund's  launch.  The  rapid  accumulation  of the
stabilization fund recently triggered discussions on when and why the excess oil
stabilization  fund could be  tapped.  At the  beginning  of  November,  Finance
Minister  Alexei Kudrin  announced  proposals,  which were backed by the Central
Bank of Russia,  President Putin as well as key players in the  government.  The
proposals  agreed to preserve the integrity of the fund in its core functions as
a fiscal stabilizer.  Additionally,  it was confirmed that the fund will be used
to fund external debt repayment.  This was emphasized again in President Putin's
speech at the Congress of Russia's Union of  Industrialists,  when he called for
strict  fiscal  discipline  and  categorically  ruled out the idea of  investing
windfall  oil  revenues  in  domestic  spending.  Fiscal  discipline  is  widely
recognized as central to Russia's  strong  economic  performance  since 1999. As
such,  the recent  events are an  important  and positive  macroeconomic  policy
development for Russia.

Q: WE HAVE  RECENTLY  SEEN A DROP IN OIL  PRICES.  WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE ON
YOUR PORTFOLIO, AND YOUR TOP NAMES IN THE HOLDINGS?

A: The  change in  international  oil  prices  has had an effect not only on oil
companies,  but on the broader  Russian  economy because of its high exposure to
the oil  sector.  The lower  international  oil price  implies  a  weakening  of
Russia's  current account and thus, a weaker ruble.  Specifically  for our stock
holdings,  the net effect of the currently  observed  weakening in international
oil prices on the  profitability of the Russian oil companies should not be that
dramatic.  The  Russian tax  legislation  for the oil sector  dictates  that the
Russian oil companies  are only able to secure 10 cents in  additional  earnings
out of each incremental  $1/bbl increase in oil price above $25/bbl.  Therefore,
the  companies  with the highest  operating  costs and,  consequently,  narrower
margins,  are the most  sensitive to a change in the oil price at the net income
level.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CZECH REPUBLIC:

GDP  growth  in Q2 of 2004  defied  expectations  with a gain  of 4.1%  (y-o-y),
compared with 3.5% in the previous quarter. Not surprisingly, the second quarter
was also one of  excellent  industrial  activity,  although  consumer  sentiment
remained  subdued.  GDP  growth  may hover  near  4.0% for the third and  fourth
quarters,  bolstered  by the  solid  industrial  activity  -- and  perhaps  some
improvement in demand from the EU.

Inflation (CPI) increased  during the summer,  reaching 3.5% (y-o-y) in October,
and the Czech  Central  Bank made  another  tightening  move in response to this
inflationary uptick. Additionally, the state budget deficit reached 7% of GDP by
the end of the  second  quarter,  although  improved  tax  revenues  slowed  the
deficit's  expansion  in July and  August.  The  medium-term  trend  points to a
current account deficit of more than 5.0% of GDP. While this is a bit unnerving,
the Czechs  have not yet had any  difficulty  in  funding  the  current  account
deficit because of fairly stable flows from foreign direct investment (FDI).

HUNGARY:

Hungary's economy continues to grapple with its three principal challenges:  the
government budget deficit,  the current account deficit and inflation pressures.
The CPI peaked in May,  but from July to August,  the rate  remained  unchanged,
indicating that inflation had stabilized and could decline slowly. This scenario
was confirmed by a  stronger-than-expected  decline in the CPI in September. The
National Bank of Hungary (NBH) remains concerned about the relatively high level
of inflation,  although there are now some signs that the inflationary pressures
- --  created by the rapid  wage  growth  seen  earlier  this year -- are  easing.
Inflation,  combined  with a  firmer  forint,  prompted  the NBH to  extend  its
interest-rate-cutting cycle.

On the twin deficit front,  the current account remains a problem,  with the gap
widening from 8.8% of GDP in the first  quarter to 10.5% in the second  quarter.
There is less pressure from fiscal developments. After a run in the spring, when
the second  quarter  budget gap reached 12.0% of GDP, the average  shortfall for
July and  August  came to 4.5% of GDP.  Just the same,  the yearly  number  will
probably be slightly  more than 6.0%,  and could climb even higher in 2005. As a
result,  a weaker forint  cannot be ruled out going  forward.  However,  the NBH
would probably not hesitate to raise interest rates again if currency  weakening
became  excessive.  In the past,  this  tactic  has proved to be  successful  in
providing  support to the forint.  Overall,  Hungary  remains  vulnerable to any
weakening of investor  sentiment or international  conditions due to its tenuous
economic situation.

POLAND:

The Polish  economy  maintained  a strong pace in the second  quarter,  with GDP
growth of 6.1% (y-o-y), albeit lower than the first quarter's 6.9%. The headline
figure again exceeded  expectations,  and was aided by the ongoing  expansion in
industrial output and robust domestic consumption.  That said, the pace of fixed
investment  is still  lagging,  which  leaves  questions  about the capacity for
future  economic  growth.  The growth in domestic  demand by both  consumers and
industry  also meant a widening  of the  current  account  deficit in the second
quarter.  The rate of expansion  bears  watching,  but recent data point to some
slowing in the pace of the  economy,  which could be healthy for an economy that
was starting to show signs of  overheating.  Additionally,  the National Bank of
Poland (NBP) may grow less  aggressive in its  interest-rate-raising  decisions.
Still,  inflation,  pushed by high energy and commodity prices, is still running
ahead  of  target  and the NBP  likely  will be  watching  to see if some of the
externally-driven materials-cost increases become embedded in core inflation.

There was positive news on the government  budget side. Partly due to the strong
economy, which has led to better-than-expected  tax revenues, the budget deficit
has been coming in ahead of forecasts,  with the second quarter gap down to 4.1%
of GDP, after hitting 5.4% in the first quarter.  In July and August, the budget
deficit  averaged  4.2%,  meaning the  full-year  figure has a chance to come in
under the  targeted  deficit of 5.6% of GDP. The zloty  strengthened  during the
third  quarter,  which has served to mute the rise in import prices and does not
seem to have hurt  exports  too much.  The  zloty's  strength  seems  related to
investment  inflows,  in terms of both FDI and  portfolio.  We  attribute  zloty
strength to a more stable  political  environment,  better-than-expected  fiscal
performance and a sustainable current account outlook.

RUSSIA:

The Russian economy is being  propelled by high export  revenues  generated from
highly  priced  commodities  (oil and also  metals).  GDP growth was 7.4% in the
second  quarter,  in which  reflected no change from the previous  quarter.  The
current account surplus remained healthy, even though



                                        6

the smaller import bill was rising more rapidly.  Industrial  production  growth
was slightly lower than the GDP trend, while consumer spending remained buoyant.
This strong demand made it harder to rein in prices, despite an official goal of
cutting the CPI to 10.0% by year end.  The y-o-y CPI figure  moved from 10.2% in
June to 11.6% in October --well above the expected target.

The  benefits  of the  strong  economy  are felt in the state  budget,  however.
Whereas at the  beginning of the year,  the goal was a surplus of less than 1.0%
of GDP, it now appears  that the budget  surplus will exceed 3.0% of GDP for the
year. In fact, the government's stabilization fund, a cushion for debt repayment
needs,  could reach 500 billion  rubles  (roughly  $17  billion) by year end. On
balance,  the economic outlook looks healthy,  albeit increasingly  dependent on
commodity prices, with the main concerns focused on the stubbornly high level of
inflation and the implementation of structural reforms.

Politically,  the country's  direction has turned more  authoritarian,  with the
Putin  government  centralizing  more power and further limiting media freedoms.
While this is seen as problematic in the West,  Russians  generally view this as
increasing  stability.  However, the centralization has detracted attention away
from the much delayed reform agenda. Certainly,  challenges to Putin's political
dominance are viewed with hostility by the government; the case of Yukos and its
jailed  indirect  major  shareholder   Mikhail   Khodorkovsky   underscore  this
hostility. Government efforts to promote more transparency and better management
in business circles -- and to attract foreign capital -- seem to have hit a snag
in the aftermath of the Yukos case. Recent investment agreements between Russian
and multi-national firms in the energy sector in particular seem to suggest that
new rules have emerged.  However,  the risk of another  oligarch  being targeted
(i.e.  the Yukos case not being unique) could  seriously  undermine the enhanced
investment case for Russia.

TURKEY:

Industrial sector activity continued at a strong pace, fueled by robust exports.
During the second quarter,  growth in this sector was up 16.2%, a pace that must
slow given the capacity utilization rate, which now exceeds 80.0%. Durable goods
production remained robust,  especially in the arena of consumer electronics and
automotive.  (This trend could be softened in coming months, however, due to the
recent lira appreciation.)

After  posting  GDP growth of 12.5%  during  the first  half of 2004,  full-year
growth of more than 9.0%  appears  possible.  The  positive  trend in  inflation
became less pronounced due to rising commodity import prices and summertime food
prices dropping less than usual.  Moreover, the WPI has edged above 12.0% y-o-y,
meaning the latest  move up in the CPI,  from the 32-year low of 8.9% in June to
10.0% in  August,  may be hard to  immediately  reverse.  The  official  target,
however, of 12.0% for year end, still looks feasible.

On the fiscal  side,  Turkey  restrained  its  spending  and raised its revenues
enough to exceed  its goal of a primary  surplus  of 6.5%.  The drop in  funding
costs helped,  as did improved tax receipts  resulting from the booming economy.
Government  discipline  was also  instrumental.  The one weak  spot in  Turkey's
economic  picture is the current account  deficit,  which could more than double
this year  despite  inflows  from tourism and other  investment  accounts  could
become a concern if it expands further in 2005.

On the  political  side,  EU  negotiations  appeared at risk for a short time in
September,  when Prime  Minister  Erdogan  seemed  determined  to push through a
clause in the new penal code which would have made adultery a criminal  offense.
This issue became a point of heated  contention  within the EU. In the end, this
clause was removed,  and the penal code,  otherwise tailored to EU requirements,
was passed.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Fund has an attractive way to purchase additional shares at reduced cost.
This is the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program  which  is part of the  Dividend
Reinvestment Plan. By enrolling in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Program,  you may
make  additional  investments  each month--as  little as $100 in any month or as
much as $36,000 a year.  Share  purchases  are  combined to receive a beneficial
brokerage  fee. The Voluntary  Cash Purchase  Program and Dividend  Reinvestment
Plan has been amended to allow  enrollment in the Plan by making an initial cash
deposit of at least $250 with the plan agent.

PRIVACY POLICY AND PRACTICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   We  never  sell  customer  lists  or  information  about  individual  clients
(stockholders).  We consider privacy fundamental to our client relationships and
adhere to the  policies and  practices  described  below to protect  current and
former  clients'  information.   Internal  policies  are  in  place  to  protect
confidentiality,  while allowing client needs to be served. Only individuals who
need to do so in  carrying  out their job  responsibilities  may  access  client
information.  We maintain  physical,  electronic and procedural  safeguards that
comply  with  federal  and state  standards  to protect  confidentiality.  These
safeguards extend to all forms of interaction with us, including the Internet.
   In  the  normal  course  of  business,   we  may  obtain   information  about
stockholders  whose shares are registered in their names.  For purposes of these
policies,  "clients"  means  stockholders of the Fund. (We generally do not have
knowledge of or collect personal  information  about  stockholders who hold Fund
shares in  "street"  name," such as through  brokers or banks.)  Examples of the
nonpublic  personal  information  collected are name,  address,  Social Security
number and transaction and balance information. To be able to serve our clients,
certain  of  this  client   information   may  be  shared  with  affiliated  and
nonaffiliated third party service providers such as transfer agents, custodians,
and  broker-dealers  to assist us in processing  transactions  and servicing the
client's account with us. The organizations  described above that receive client
information may only use it for the purpose designated by the Fund.
   We may also disclose  nonpublic  personal  information about clients to other
parties as required or permitted by law. For example,  we are required or we may
provide  information to government  entities or regulatory bodies in response to
requests  for  information  or  subpoenas,   to  private  litigants  in  certain
circumstances,  to law  enforcement  authorities,  or any  time  we  believe  it
necessary to protect the firm from such activity.

THE CENTRAL EUROPE AND RUSSIA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--OCTOBER 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  Central  Europe and Russia  Fund,  Inc.  is a  non-diversified,  closed-end
management investment company incorporated in Maryland.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and  liabilities  denominated  in euros and other  foreign  currency  are
translated into United States dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the buying
and selling spot rates quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Purchases
and sales of investment securities, income and expenses are reported at the rate
of  exchange  prevailing  on the  respective  dates  of such  transactions.  The
resultant  gains  and  losses  arising  from  exchange  rate   fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable to  investments,  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts  that  contain a variety  of  representations  which  provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience,  the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code   applicable   to  regulated   investment   companies   and  to  distribute
substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
        ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
The Fund had a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager").  At its July 12, 2004 Board meeting, the Board approved transferring
the Fund's  management  agreement  with  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  to an
affiliated company,  Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. The transfer,
which became effective September 1, 2004, does not involve any change in control
or actual  management  of the  investment  manager,  which will provide the same
scope of  services,  will  utilize the same people for work on Fund  matters and
will  charge  the same fees  under  the  agreement.  The Fund has an  Investment
Advisory  Agreement  with  Deutsche  Asset  Management  International  GmbH (the
"Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the  Investment  Adviser are affiliated
companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100  million,  and .55% of such assets in excess of $100  million.
The Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides the Investment Adviser with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100  million.  Accordingly,  for the year ended  October 31,  2004,  the fee
pursuant to the Management and Investment  Advisory Agreements was equivalent to
an annual effective rate of .88% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser,  in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objective,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders to select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf
of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG, the German parent of the Manager and Investment Adviser.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for the  year  ended  October  31,  2004  were  $156,993,318  and  $103,773,200,
respectively.

The cost of investments at October 31, 2004 was  $184,570,804  for United States
Federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, as of October 31, 2004, net unrealized
appreciation of investments aggregated  $104,805,738,  of which $107,296,545 and
$2,490,807 related to unrealized appreciation and depreciation, respectively.

For United  States  Federal  income tax  purposes,  the Fund had a capital  loss
carryforward at October 31, 2004 of  approximately  $3,500,000 which will expire
in 2010.

No capital  gains  distribution  is  expected to be paid to  shareholders  until
future net gains have been realized in excess of such carry forward.

      price as of the beginning of the year, dividends,  capital gains and other

      reinvestment  plan and then sold at the closing  market price per share on
      the last day of the  year.  The  computation  does not  reflect  any sales

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc.

   In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities,
including the schedule of investments,  and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Central Europe and Russia Fund,
Inc.  (the "Fund") at October 31, 2004,  the results of its  operations  for the
year then ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United  States of  America.  These  financial  statements  and  financial
highlights   (hereafter   referred  to  as  "financial   statements")   are  the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management;  our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  financial  statements in  accordance  with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities  at October  31,  2004 by  correspondence  with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Fund offers  shareholders a Voluntary Cash Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  A more complete  description of the Plan is provided in
the Plan brochure available from Investors Bank & Trust Company,  the plan agent
(the "Plan Agent"),  Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 9130, Boston,  Massachusetts
02117 (telephone  1-800-437-6269).  A shareholder  should read the Plan brochure
carefully before enrolling in the Plan.

   Under the Plan, participating  shareholders ("Plan Participants") appoint the
Plan Agent to receive or invest  Fund  distributions  as  described  below under
"Reinvestment of Fund Shares." In addition,  Plan Participants may make optional
cash  purchases  through  the Plan  Agent as often as once a month as  described
below under "Voluntary Cash Purchases."  There is no charge to Plan Participants
for participating in the Plan, although when shares are purchased under the Plan
by the Plan  Agent on the New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  otherwise  on the open
market, each Plan Participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred  in  connection   with  such   purchases,   as  described  below  under
"Reinvestment  of Fund Shares" and "Voluntary Cash  Purchases."

REINVESTMENT  OF FUND  SHARES.  Whenever  the  Fund  declares  a  capital  gains
distribution, an income dividend or a return of capital distribution payable, at
the election of shareholders,  either in cash or in Fund shares, or payable only
in cash, the Plan Agent shall automatically elect to receive Fund shares for the
account of each Plan Participant.

   Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains  distribution,  an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock equals or is less than the market price per
share on the valuation  date (the "Market  Parity or  Premium"),  the Plan Agent
shall  apply the  amount of such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan
Participant   to  the  purchase  from  the  Fund  of  Fund  Shares  for  a  Plan
Participant's  account,  except that if the Fund does not offer  shares for such
purpose because it concludes  Securities Act registration  would be required and
such registration cannot be timely effected or is not otherwise a cost-effective
alternative  for the  Fund,  then the Plan  Agent  shall  follow  the  procedure
described in the next paragraph.  The number of additional shares to be credited
to a Plan  Participant's  account  shall be  determined  by dividing  the dollar
amount of the distribution  payable to a Plan Participant by the net asset value
per share of the Fund's common stock on the valuation  date, or if the net asset
value  per share is less than 95% of the  market  price per share on such  date,
then by 95% of the  market  price  per  share.  The  valuation  date will be the
payable date for such dividend or distribution.

   Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains  distribution,  an income dividend
or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value
per share of the Fund's  common stock  exceeds the market price per share on the
valuation date (the "Market Discount"), the Plan Agent shall apply the amount of
such  dividend  or  distribution  payable  to a Plan  Participant  (less  a Plan
Participant's pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred with respect to
open-market  purchases in connection  with the  reinvestment of such dividend or
distribution)  to the  purchase  on the open  market of Fund  shares  for a Plan
Participant's  account.  The  valuation  date will be the payable  date for such
dividend or  distribution.  Such  purchases will be made on or shortly after the
valuation  date and in no event more than 30 days after such date  except  where
temporary  curtailment  or  suspension  of purchase is  necessary to comply with
applicable provisions of federal securities laws.

   The  Plan  Agent  may  aggregate  a Plan  Participant's  purchases  with  the
purchases of other Plan Participants, and the average price (including brokerage
commissions)  of all shares  purchased  by the Plan Agent shall be the price per
share allocable to each Plan Participant.

   For all purposes of the Plan,  the market price of the Fund's common stock on
a payable  date shall be the last sales price on the New York Stock  Exchange on
that date,  or, if there is no sale on such  Exchange  (or,  if  different,  the
principal  exchange  for Fund  shares) on that date,  then the mean  between the
closing bid and asked  quotations  for such stock on such Exchange on such date.
The net asset value per share of the Fund's  common  stock on a  valuation  date
shall be as determined by or on behalf of the Fund.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Plan Agent may hold a Plan Participant's  shares acquired pursuant to the
Plan,  together with the shares of other Plan Participants  acquired pursuant to
this Plan, in  non-certificated  form in the name of the Plan Agent or that of a
nominee.  The Plan  Agent  will  forward  to each  Plan  Participant  any  proxy
solicitation  material  and will vote any shares so held for a Plan  Participant
only in accordance  with the proxy  returned by a Plan  Participant to the Fund.
Upon a Plan Participant's written request, the Plan Agent will deliver to a Plan
Participant,  without charge,  a certificate or certificates for the full shares
held by the Plan Agent.

VOLUNTARY  CASH  PURCHASES.   Plan   Participants  have  the  option  of  making
investments in Fund shares through the Plan Agent as often as once a month. Plan
Participants  may  invest as  little  as $100 in any month and may  invest up to
$36,000 annually through the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan.

   The Plan Agent  shall apply such funds  (less a Plan  Participant's  pro rata
share of brokerage  commissions  or other costs,  if any) to the purchase on the
New York Stock  Exchange (or, if different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund
shares)  or  otherwise  on  the  open  market  of  Fund  shares  for  such  Plan
Participant's account, regardless of whether there is a Market Parity or Premium
or a Market Discount.  The Plan Agent will purchase shares for Plan Participants
on or about the 15th of each  month.  Cash  payments  received by the Plan Agent
less than five business days prior to a cash  purchase  investment  date will be
held by the Plan Agent until the next month's investment date.  Uninvested funds
will not bear  interest.  Plan  Participants  may  withdraw any  voluntary  cash
payment  by  written  notice  received  by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL. Both current shareholders and first-time investors in
the Fund are eligible to participate in the Plan.  Current  shareholders my join
the Plan by either  enrolling  their  shares with the Plan Agent or by making an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent.  First-time investors
in the Fund may join the Plan by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250
with the Plan Agent. In order to become a Plan  Participant,  shareholders  must
complete and sign the  enrollment  form included in the Plan brochure and return
it, and, if applicable, an initial cash deposit of at least $250 directly to the
Plan Agent if shares are  registered in their name.  Shareholders  who hold Fund
shares in the name of a brokerage  firm,  bank or other nominee  should  contact
such nominee to arrange for it to participate in the Plan on such  shareholder's
behalf.

   If the Plan  Participant  elects  to  participate  in the  Plan by  enrolling
current shares owned by the Plan Participant with the Plan Agent,  participation
in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the next dividend
or capital gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan Agent  receives the Plan
Participant's written authorization,  provided such authorization is received by
the Plan Agent prior to the record date for such  dividend or  distribution.  If
such  authorization  is received after such record date, the Plan  Participant's
participation in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan begins with the
following dividend or distribution.

   If the Plan  Participant  elects  to  participate  in the Plan by  making  an
initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Plan Agent,  participation in the
dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan  begins  with the next  dividend  or
capital  gains  distribution  payable  after the Plan  Agent  receives  the Plan
Participant's  authorization  and  deposit,  and after the Plan Agent  purchases
shares  for the  Plan  Participant  on the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  (or,  if
different,  on the principal  exchange for Fund shares) or otherwise on the open
market,  provided  that the  authorization  and  deposit are  received,  and the
purchases  are  made  by the  Plan  Agent  prior  to the  record  date.  If such
authorization  and deposit are received  after the record  date,  or if the Plan
Agent purchases shares for the Plan Participant  after the record date, the Plan
Participant's  participation  in the dividend  reinvestment  feature of the Plan
begins with the following dividend or distribution.

   A shareholder's  written  authorization  and cash payment must be received by
the Plan Agent at least five  business days in advance of the next cash purchase
investment  date  (normally  the 15th of  every  month)  in  order  for the Plan
Participant to participate in the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan in
that month.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Plan Participants may withdraw from the Plan without charge by written notice
to the Plan Agent. Plan Participants who choose to withdraw may elect to receive
stock certificates representing all of the full shares held by the Plan Agent on
their  behalf,  or to  instruct  the Plan  Agent to sell  such full  shares  and
distribute the proceeds, net of brokerage commissions,  to such withdrawing Plan
Participant.  Withdrawing Plan  Participants  will receive a cash adjustment for
the market  value of any  fractional  shares held on their behalf at the time of
termination.   Withdrawal  will  be  effective   immediately   with  respect  to
distributions  with a record  date not less than 10 days later  than  receipt of
such written notice by the Plan Agent.

AMENDMENT AND  TERMINATION OF PLAN. The Plan may only be amended or supplemented
by the Fund or by the Plan Agent by giving each Plan Participant  written notice
at least 90 days prior to the effective  date of such  amendment or  supplement,
except that such notice period may be shortened when necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with  applicable  law or the rules or policies of the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory body.

   The Plan may be terminated by the Fund or by the Plan Agent by written notice
mailed to each Plan Participant. Such termination will be effective with respect
to all  distributions  with a record  date at least 90 days after the mailing of
such written notice to the Plan Participants.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS OF REINVESTMENT OF FUND SHARES.  Reinvestment of
Fund shares does not relieve Plan  Participants from any income tax which may be
payable on dividends or  distributions.  For U.S.  federal  income tax purposes,
when the Fund issues shares  representing  an income dividend or a capital gains
dividend,  a  Participant  will  include in income the fair market  value of the
shares received as of the payment date,  which will be ordinary  dividend income
or capital gains,  as the case may be. The shares will have a tax basis equal to
such fair market value,  and the holding period for the shares will begin on the
day after the date of  distribution.  If shares are purchased on the open market
by the Plan Agent, a Plan  Participant  will include in income the amount of the
cash payment  made.  The basis of such shares will be the purchase  price of the
shares,  and the holding  period for the shares will begin on the day  following
the date of purchase. State, local and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

THERE ARE THREE  CLOSED-END  FUNDS  INVESTING  IN EUROPEAN  EQUITIES  MANAGED BY
WHOLLY  OWNED  SUBSIDIARIES  OF THE  DEUTSCHE  BANK GROUP:

o The Germany  Fund,  Inc.--investing   primarily  in equities of  major  German
    corporations.  It may also  invest up to 20% in  equities  of other  Western
    European companies (with no more than 15% in any single country).
o The New Germany Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in the middle  market German
    companies and up to 20%  elsewhere in Western  Europe (with no more than 10%
    in any single country).
o The Central  Europe and  Russia  Fund,  Inc.--investing  primarily in  Central

Please consult your broker for advice on any of the above or call  1-800-GERMANY

These  funds  are  not  diversified  and  focus  their  investments  in  certain
geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic  changes and market  risks.  This may result in greater share price
volatility.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period, October 31, 2004, The Central Europe and Russia
Fund, Inc. has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR,
that applies to its President and Treasurer and its Chief Financial Officer.

There have been no amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of the code of
ethics during the period covered by this report that would require disclosure
under Item 2.

A copy of the code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has determined that the Fund has at least
one "audit committee financial expert" serving on its audit committee: Mr.
Robert H. Wadsworth. This audit committee member is "independent," meaning that
he is not an "interested person" of the Fund (as that term is defined in Section
2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) and he does not accept any
consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Fund (except in the
capacity as a Board or committee member).

An "audit committee financial expert" is not an "expert" for any purpose,
including for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result
of being designated as an "audit committee financial expert." Further, the
designation of a person as an "audit committee financial expert" does not mean
that the person has any greater duties, obligations, or liability than those
imposed on the person without the "audit committee financial expert"
designation. Similarly, the designation of a person as an "audit committee
financial expert" does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any
other member of the audit committee or board of directors.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                       CENTRAL EUROPE AND RUSSIA FUND
                    FORM N-CSR DISCLOSURE RE: AUDIT FEES

as:

         o  Shareholder Rights -- The advisor generally votes against proposals
            that restrict shareholder rights.

         o  Corporate Governance -- The advisor generally votes for confidential
            and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements
            for charter and bylaw amendments.

         o  Anti-Takeover Matters -- The advisor generally votes for proposals
            that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that
            request boards to redeem poison pills, and votes "against" the
            adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder
            ratification. The advisor generally votes for fair price proposals.

         o  Routine Matters -- The advisor generally votes for the ratification
            of auditors, procedural matters related to the annual meeting, and
            changes in company name, and against bundled proposals and
            adjournment.

The general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies. The
advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance
with the recommendations of an independent third-party, except for proxies
solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an
affiliate serves as investment advisor or principal underwriter ("affiliated
investment companies"). The advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies
in the same proportion as the vote of the investment company's other
shareholders (sometimes called "mirror" or "echo" voting). Master fund proxies
solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Although the Guidelines set forth the advisor's general voting positions on
various proposals, the advisor may, consistent with the Fund's best interests,
determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions.

The Guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of
individual members of the board, or of a majority of the board. In addition, the
Guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices
of the public companies within the Deutsche Bank organization or of the
investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment
advisor or sponsor.

The advisor may consider the views of a portfolio company's management in
deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the
Guidelines, but management's views are not determinative.

As mentioned above, the Policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves
conflicts of interest. To resolve conflicts, the advisor, under normal
circumstances, votes proxies in accordance with its Guidelines. If the advisor
departs from the Guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the
Guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal, a proxy voting
committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy. Before voting any such
proxy, however, the advisor's conflicts review committee will conduct an
investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in
connection with the particular proxy proposal. If the conflicts review committee
determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest, or certain
individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating
in a particular proxy vote, it will inform the proxy voting committee. If
notified that the advisor has a material conflict, or fewer than three voting
members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote, typically the advisor
will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy
voting recommendations of an independent third party. Under certain
circumstances, the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may
find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits
associated with voting. For example, the advisor may not vote

proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs. The
advisor generally does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking
restrictions.

I.       Overview

This Principal  Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Code of Ethics
("Officer Code") sets forth the policies,  practices,  and values expected to be
exhibited  in the conduct of the  Principal  Executive  Officers  and  Principal
Financial  Officers of the investment  companies  ("Funds") they serve ("Covered
Officers"). A list of Covered Officers and Funds is included on Appendix A.

The Boards of the Funds  listed on  Appendix A have  elected  to  implement  the
Officer Code,  pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
SEC's rules thereunder, to promote and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in
their Covered Officers.

Deutsche  Asset  Management,  Inc.  or its  affiliates  ("DeAM")  serves  as the
investment adviser to each Fund. All Covered Officers are also employees of DeAM
or an  affiliate.  Thus,  in addition to  adhering  to the Officer  Code,  these
individuals must comply with DeAM policies and procedures, such as the DeAM Code
of Ethics  governing  personal trading  activities,  as adopted pursuant to Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.^1 In addition,  such individuals
also must comply with other applicable Fund policies and procedures.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer,  who shall not be a Covered Officer and who shall
serve  as such  subject  to the  approval  of the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee
thereof), is primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing this Code. The
Compliance  Officer has the  authority  to  interpret  this Officer Code and its
applicability to particular circumstances.  Any questions about the Officer Code
should be directed to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer and his or her contact  information can be found in
Appendix A.

II.      Purposes of the Officer Code

The purposes of the Officer Code are to deter wrongdoing and to:

o        promote honest and ethical  conduct among Covered  Officers,  including
         the  ethical  handling  of actual or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest
         between personal and professional relationships;

o        promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable  disclosures in
         reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file with or submit to the SEC
         (and in other public communications from the Funds) and that are within
         the Covered Officer's responsibilities;

o        promote compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;

o        encourage  the prompt  internal  reporting of violations of the Officer
         Code to the DeAM Compliance Officer; and

o        establish accountability for adherence to the Officer Code.

Any  questions  about the Officer  Code should be referred to DeAM's  Compliance
Officer.

- --------

^1 The  obligations  imposed  by the  Officer  Code are  separate  from,  and in
addition to, any obligations  imposed under codes of ethics adopted  pursuant to
Rule  17j-1  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  and any other code of
conduct  applicable to Covered  Officers in whatever  capacity  they serve.  The
Officer  Code does not  incorporate  any of those other codes and,  accordingly,
violations of those codes will not  necessarily be considered  violations of the
Officer Code and waivers granted under those codes would not necessarily require
a waiver to be granted under this Code.  Sanctions imposed under those codes may
be considered  in  determining  appropriate  sanctions for any violation of this
Code.

III.     Responsibilities of Covered Officers

A.       Honest and Ethical Conduct

         It is the duty of every Covered  Officer to encourage  and  demonstrate
         honest and ethical conduct,  as well as adhere to and require adherence
         to the Officer Code and any other  applicable  policies and  procedures
         designed to promote this behavior.  Covered  Officers must at all times
         conduct  themselves with integrity and  distinction,  putting first the
         interests of the Fund(s) they serve.  Covered  Officers  must be honest
         and candid  while  maintaining  confidentiality  of  information  where
         required by law, DeAM policy or Fund policy.

         Covered   Officers  also  must,  at  all  times,  act  in  good  faith,
         responsibly  and with  due  care,  competence  and  diligence,  without
         misrepresenting  or being  misleading  about material facts or allowing
         their  independent  judgment to be subordinated.  Covered Officers also
         should maintain skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of
         their duties for the Fund(s).  Covered  Officers also must  responsibly
         use and control all Fund assets and resources entrusted to them.

         Covered  Officers may not  retaliate  against  others for, or otherwise
         discourage  the  reporting  of,  actual or apparent  violations  of the
         Officer Code or applicable laws or regulations. Covered Officers should
         create an  environment  that  encourages  the exchange of  information,
         including concerns of the type that this Code is designed to address.

B.       Conflicts of Interest

         A  "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's  personal
         interests  interfere with the interests of the Fund for which he or she
         serves as an officer.  Covered  Officers may not  improperly  use their
         position with a Fund for personal or private gain to themselves,  their
         family,  or any other person.  Similarly,  Covered Officers may not use
         their  personal  influence  or  personal   relationships  to  influence
         decisions  or other Fund  business or  operational  matters  where they
         would  benefit  personally  at the  Fund's  expense  or to  the  Fund's
         detriment.  Covered Officers may not cause the Fund to take action,  or
         refrain from taking action,  for their  personal  benefit at the Fund's
         expense or to the Fund's  detriment.  Some  examples  of  conflicts  of
         interest  follow  (this  is not an  all-inclusive  list):  being in the
         position of  supervising,  reviewing or having any influence on the job
         evaluation,  pay or benefit of any  immediate  family  member who is an
         employee of a Fund service provider or is otherwise associated with the
         Fund; or having an ownership  interest in, or having any  consulting or
         employment relationship with, any Fund service provider other than DeAM
         or its affiliates.

         Certain  conflicts  of  interest  covered by this Code arise out of the
         relationships  between  Covered  Officers and the Fund that already are
         subject to conflict of interest  provisions in the  Investment  Company
         Act and the Investment Advisers Act. For example,  Covered Officers may
         not individually  engage in certain  transactions (such as the purchase
         or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of their
         status as  "affiliated  persons"  of the Fund.  Covered  Officers  must
         comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Therefore, any violations
         of  existing  statutory  and  regulatory   prohibitions  on  individual
         behavior could be considered a violation of this Code.

         As  to  conflicts  arising  from,  or  as  a  result  of  the  advisory
         relationship (or any other relationships) between the Fund and DeAM, of
         which the  Covered  Officers  are also  officers  or  employees,  it is
         recognized by the Board that, subject to DeAM's fiduciary duties to the
         Fund,  the Covered  Officers  will in the normal course of their duties
         (whether formally for the Fund or for DeAM, or for both) be involved in
         establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  which  will  have
         different  effects on


                                       4
<PAGE>

         DeAM and the Fund. The Board  recognizes that the  participation of the
         Covered  Officers  in  such  activities  is  inherent  in the  contract
         relationship  between  the Fund and DeAM,  and is  consistent  with the
         expectation of the Board of the performance by the Covered  Officers of
         their duties as officers of the Fund.

         Covered  Officers  should  avoid  actual  conflicts  of  interest,  and
         appearances  of conflicts of  interest,  between the Covered  Officer's
         duties  to the  Fund and his or her  personal  interests  beyond  those
         contemplated  or anticipated  by applicable  regulatory  schemes.  If a
         Covered  Officer  suspects or knows of a conflict or an  appearance  of
         one, the Covered Officer must immediately report the matter to the DeAM
         Compliance  Officer.  If a Covered Officer, in lieu of reporting such a
         matter to the DeAM Compliance  Officer,  may report the matter directly
         to the Fund's Board (or committee  thereof),  as appropriate  (e.g., if
         the  conflict  involves  the DeAM  Compliance  Officer  or the  Covered
         Officer reasonably  believes it would be futile to report the matter to
         the DeAM Compliance Officer).

         When  actual,  apparent or  suspected  conflicts  of interest  arise in
         connection with a Covered  Officer,  DeAM personnel aware of the matter
         should promptly contact the DeAM Compliance  Officer.  There will be no
         reprisal or retaliation against the person reporting the matter.

         Upon receipt of a report of a possible  conflict,  the DeAM  Compliance
         Officer will take steps to determine  whether a conflict exists.  In so
         doing,  the DeAM  Compliance  Officer  may take any  actions  he or she
         determines to be appropriate in his or her sole  discretion and may use
         all  reasonable  resources,   including  retaining  or  engaging  legal
         counsel,  accounting firms or other consultants,  subject to applicable
         law.^2 The costs associated with such actions may be borne by the Fund,
         if appropriate,  after consultation with the Fund's Board (or committee
         thereof).  Otherwise,  such  costs  will be  borne  by  DeAM  or  other
         appropriate Fund service provider.

         After full review of a report of a possible  conflict of interest,  the
         DeAM  Compliance  Officer may determine  that no conflict or reasonable
         appearance  of a conflict  exists.  If,  however,  the DeAM  Compliance
         Officer  determines  that an actual  conflict  exists,  the  Compliance
         Officer will resolve the conflict  solely in the interests of the Fund,
         and will report the conflict and its resolution to the Fund's Board (or
         committee thereof).  If the DeAM Compliance Officer determines that the
         appearance of a conflict exists,  the DeAM Compliance Officer will take
         appropriate  steps to remedy such  appearance.  In lieu of  determining
         whether  a  conflict  exists  and/or  resolving  a  conflict,  the DeAM
         Compliance Officer instead may refer the matter to the Fund's Board (or
         committee  thereof),  as  appropriate.  However,  the  DeAM  Compliance
         Officer  must  refer the  matter  to the  Fund's  Board  (or  committee
         thereof) if the DeAM  Compliance  Officer is  directly  involved in the
         conflict or under similar appropriate circumstances.

         After  responding to a report of a possible  conflict of interest,  the
         DeAM  Compliance  Officer  will  discuss  the  matter  with the  person
         reporting it (and with the Covered  Officer at issue, if different) for
         purposes  of  educating   those  involved  on  conflicts  of  interests
         (including how to detect and avoid them, if appropriate).

         Appropriate   resolution   of  conflicts   may  restrict  the  personal
         activities of the Covered  Officer and/or his family,  friends or other
         persons.

         Solely because a conflict is disclosed to the DeAM  Compliance  Officer
         (and/or the Board or  Committee  thereof)  and/or  resolved by the DeAM
         Compliance  Officer does not mean that the  conflict or its  resolution
         constitutes a waiver from the Code's requirements.

- -----------------

^2 For  example,  retaining  a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit  committee.

                                       5
<PAGE>

         Any  questions  about  conflicts  of  interests,  including  whether  a
         particular  situation  might be a  conflict  or an  appearance  of one,
         should be directed to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

         C.       Use of Personal Fund Shareholder Information

         A Covered Officer may not use or disclose  personal  information  about
         Fund  shareholders,  except in the performance of his or her duties for
         the Fund. Each Covered Officer also must abide by the Funds' and DeAM's
         privacy policies under SEC Regulation S-P.

         D.       Public Communications

         In connection with his or her  responsibilities for or involvement with
         a  Fund's  public   communications  and  disclosure   documents  (e.g.,
         shareholder reports,  registration  statements,  press releases),  each
         Covered  Officer must  provide  information  to Fund service  providers
         (within the DeAM  organization  or  otherwise)  and to the Fund's Board
         (and  any  committees  thereof),   independent   auditors,   government
         regulators and  self-regulatory  organizations that is fair,  accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable.

         Further,  within the scope of their  duties,  Covered  Officers  having
         direct or supervisory authority over Fund disclosure documents or other
         public Fund communications will, to the extent appropriate within their
         area of responsibility, endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate
         and  understandable  disclosure  in  Fund  disclosure  documents.  Such
         Covered Officers will oversee, or appoint others to oversee,  processes
         for the timely and accurate  creation and review of all public  reports
         and regulatory filings. Within the scope of his or her responsibilities
         as a Covered  Officer,  each  Covered  Officer  also  will  familiarize
         himself or herself with the disclosure  requirements  applicable to the
         Fund,  as well as the business and  financial  operations  of the Fund.
         Each Covered  Officer  also will adhere to, and will promote  adherence
         to, applicable disclosure controls, processes and procedures, including
         DeAM's Disclosure Controls and Procedures,  which govern the process by
         which Fund disclosure documents are created and reviewed.

         To the extent that Covered  Officers  participate  in the creation of a
         Fund's  books or records,  they must do so in a way that  promotes  the
         accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records.

E.       Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations

         In connection with his or her duties and within the scope of his or her
         responsibilities as a Covered Officer, each Covered Officer must comply
         with governmental  laws, rules and regulations,  accounting  standards,
         and  Fund   policies/procedures   that   apply  to  his  or  her  role,
         responsibilities  and duties  with  respect  to the Funds  ("Applicable
         Laws").  These  requirements  do not  impose on  Covered  Officers  any
         additional  substantive duties.  Additionally,  Covered Officers should
         promote compliance with Applicable Laws.

         If a Covered  Officer  knows of any material  violations  of Applicable
         Laws or suspects that such a violation may have  occurred,  the Covered
         Officer  is  expected  to  promptly  report  the  matter  to  the  DeAM
         Compliance Officer.

IV.      Violation Reporting

A.       Overview

Each Covered Officer must promptly report to the DeAM Compliance Officer, and
promote the reporting of, any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code.
Failure to report a violation may be a violation of the Officer Code.

Examples of violations of the Officer Code include, but are not limited to, the
following:

o        Unethical or dishonest behavior

o        Obvious lack of adherence to policies surrounding review and approval
         of public communications and regulatory filings

o        Failure to report violations of the Officer Code

o        Known or obvious deviations from Applicable Laws

o        Failure to acknowledge and certify adherence to the Officer Code

The DeAM Compliance Officer has the authority to take any and all action he or
she considers appropriate in his or her sole discretion to investigate known or
suspected Code violations, including consulting with the Fund's Board, the
independent Board members, a Board committee, the Fund's legal counsel and/or
counsel to the independent Board members. The Compliance Officer also has the
authority to use all reasonable resources to investigate violations, including
retaining or engaging legal counsel, accounting firms or other consultants,
subject to applicable law.^3 The costs associated with such actions may be borne
by the Fund, if appropriate, after consultation with the Fund's Board (or
committee thereof). Otherwise, such costs will be borne by DeAM.

B.       How to Report

Any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code must be promptly reported
to the DeAM Compliance Officer.

C.       Process for Violation Reporting to the Fund Board

The DeAM Compliance Officer will promptly report any violations of the Code to
the Fund's Board (or committee thereof).

D.       Sanctions for Code Violations

Violations of the Code will be taken seriously. In response to reported or
otherwise known violations, DeAM and the relevant Fund's Board may impose
sanctions within the scope of their respective authority over the Covered
Officer at issue. Sanctions imposed by DeAM could include termination of
employment. Sanctions imposed by a Fund's Board could include termination of
association with the Fund.

V.       Waivers from the Officer Code

A Covered  Officer may request a waiver from the Officer Code by  transmitting a
written request for a waiver to the DeAM Compliance  Officer.^4 The request must
include the  rationale  for the request and must explain how the waiver would be
in furtherance of the standards of conduct described in and underlying  purposes
of the Officer Code. The DeAM Compliance Officer will present this information

- --------------

^3 For  example,  retaining  a Fund's  independent  accounting  firm may require
pre-approval by the Fund's audit committee.

^4 Of course,  it is not a waiver of the  Officer  Code if the Fund's  Board (or
committee thereof)  determines that a matter is not a deviation from the Officer
Code's requirements or is otherwise not covered by the Code.

                                       7
<PAGE>

to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof).  The Board (or  committee)  will
determine  whether to grant the requested  waiver.  If the Board (or  committee)
grants the requested waiver, the DeAM Compliance Officer thereafter will monitor
the activities  subject to the waiver, as appropriate,  and will promptly report
to the  Fund's  Board (or  committee  thereof)  regarding  such  activities,  as
appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of any waivers granted or any implicit waivers.

VI.      Amendments to the Code

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will review the Officer Code from time to time for
its  continued  appropriateness  and will propose any  amendments  to the Fund's
Board (or  committee  thereof) on a timely  basis.  In  addition,  the Board (or
committee  thereof)  will  review the  Officer  Code at least  annually  for its
continued appropriateness and may amend the Code as necessary or appropriate.

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public
disclosures of Code amendments.

VII.     Acknowledgement and Certification of Adherence to the Officer Code

Each Covered Officer must sign a statement upon appointment as a Covered Officer
and annually  thereafter  acknowledging that he or she has received and read the
Officer Code, as amended or updated,  and confirming that he or she has complied
with it (see Appendix B:  Acknowledgement and Certification of Obligations Under
the Officer Code).

Understanding and complying with the Officer Code and truthfully  completing the
Acknowledgement and Certification Form is each Covered Officer's obligation.

The DeAM Compliance  Officer will maintain such  Acknowledgements  in the Fund's
books and records.

VIII.    Scope of Responsibilities

A Covered Officer's responsibilities under the Officer Code are limited to:

         (1)      Fund matters over which the Officer has direct  responsibility
                  or   control,   matters   in  which  the   Officer   routinely
                  participates,  and matters with which the Officer is otherwise
                  involved  (i.e.,  matters  within  the  scope  of the  Covered
                  Officer's responsibilities as a Fund officer); and

         (2)      Fund matters of which the Officer has actual knowledge.

IX.      Recordkeeping

The DeAM  Compliance  Officer  will  create  and  maintain  appropriate  records
regarding  the  implementation  and  operation  of the Officer  Code,  including
records relating to conflicts of interest  determinations  and investigations of
possible Code violations.



                                       8

X.       Confidentiality

All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this  Officer Code
shall  be  considered   confidential  and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Officer  Code,  such
matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the DeAM Compliance Officer,
the Fund's Board (or committee thereof),  legal counsel,  independent  auditors,
and any consultants engaged by the Compliance Officer.
