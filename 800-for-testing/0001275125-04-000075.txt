Letter to Stockholders

GLOBAL STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE
     The year under  review was indeed a good one for stock  markets  across the
world.  2003  was  one of the  best  examples  of  markets  "climbing  a wall of
worries".  It all looked bleak at the beginning of the year with the prospect of
major   geopolitical  risks   materializing,   recession  in  business  spending
continuing  and  deflation  becoming more of a reality.  However,  the concerted
actions of the central  banks were able to stop price  erosion and  preserve the
strength in U.S. consumer spending and keep Chinese economic growth on its path.

     While  emerging  markets  were  star  performers  due  to  an  increase  in
investors' risk appetite in the context of very favorable liquidity  conditions,
the more mature markets, such as Germany and Spain, had very good performance as
well. Although Switzerland and the United Kingdom did not perform as strongly in
their own currencies, when their returns are measured in U.S. dollar terms their
performance  was  admirable.  The Swiss market  appreciation  of 36.47% (in U.S.
dollar terms), as measured by the Swiss  Performance Index (SPI),  significantly
outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial  Average return of 28.28% and the Standard
& Poor's 500 Index return of 28.67%.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
     On December 12, 2003,  the Swiss  National Bank (SNB)  announced at a press
conference  that it would leave the target range for the 3-month Libor unchanged
at 0.00% - 0.75% and that, for the time being,  the rate would be kept at around
0.25%.  The ten-year spot interest rate on  Confederation  bonds  increased from
2.58% at the beginning of the year to 2.97% by the end of December.  Most of the
increase happened between June and the beginning of September. The last quarter,
however,  was flat. Even though the signs of an economic recovery in Switzerland
are present, a sustained upswing is not yet assured. At the same time, inflation
potential  is low.  For  these  reasons,  the SNB  maintained  its  expansionary
monetary policy.

     The real  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP) at the end of the  third  quarter
decreased  by 0.7% in  comparison  to last year.  However,  it exceeded  the two
previous  quarters.  Third quarter GDP grew by 1.0% led by higher exports (+5.2%
over the prior quarter) thanks to more favorable  exchange rate  conditions.  In
addition,  equipment  investment rose slightly following a long phase of decline
(+4.5% over the prior quarter) and consumer spending increased (+1.5%).  Leading
economic  indicators  set  a new  two-year  record  in  November,  suggesting  a
continuing positive trend for the GDP.

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

     There is, however, some concern regarding  consumption in Switzerland.  The
unemployment  rate hit a six-year  high in December at 4.1% (at the beginning of
the year the rate was at 3.5%). The SNB believes that  unemployment  should fall
and consumer  spending  should  increase  following  improvement in the economic
situation.  It is  expecting  exports  to  continue  to  develop  favorably  and
investment in equipment to experience a robust increase.  On average, it expects
a moderate  decline in economic  activity in the current year with growth in the
economy of slightly over 1.5%.

     On the inflation side, if monetary policy remains unchanged, average annual
inflation is likely to amount to 0.4% in the coming year,  1.0% in 2005 and 2.3%
in 2006.  The  SNB's  opinion  is that  price  stability  can be  maintained  by
tightening monetary policy at a later point in time.

SWISS NEWS
     On December 2, 2003, the Swiss  parliament  voted to add banking secrecy to
the constitution. Switzerland has had a banking secrecy law since 1935. However,
adding financial  privacy to the  constitution  would strengthen the law against
efforts by some European  Union  members to abolish it. With banking  secrecy in
the  constitution,  parliament  would lose the power to repeal the secrecy  law.
This is good news for the Swiss  financial  industry,  as it will assure further
guarantee of the confidentiality of domestic and foreign private clients. Before
it is part of the  constitution,  it has to be  approved  by the upper house and
then by a majority vote in a popular referendum.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR
     In the first quarter of the year  Management  kept a high level of cash due
to the strength of the Swiss  currency and the  geopolitical  risks.  The market
reached a bottom in March.  After a loss of -22% from the  beginning of the year
through  March 12th,  the SPI rallied  sharply,  gaining back 20% in seven days,
mainly  on  short  covering  in a  limited  number  of  financial  stocks.  This
volatility  made the Fund lag the benchmark for the first half of the year.  For
the rest of the year, the Fund's investment strategy was to concentrate on stock
picking,  trying  to find  undervalued  stocks  in  turnaround  situations.  The
strategy allowed the Fund to regain a positive relative  performance,  finishing
the year with a 22.54% return in local currency, 0.48% better than the SPI.

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

     The Fund  maintained,  for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  an overall
rating of four stars from  Morningstar.*  The Fund also received Lipper,  Inc.'s
top ranking for Western European  closed-end  funds in ten-year  performance for
the period ended December 31, 2002.** Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.

* Morningstar is an independent fund performance monitor. Its ratings reflect
historic risk-adjusted performance and may change monthly. Its ratings of one
(low) and five (high) stars are based on a fund's three- and five-year average
annual total returns with fee adjustments, and a risk factor that reflects fund
performance relative to three-month Treasury Bill monthly returns. Only 33% of
the funds in an investment category may receive four or five stars. As of
12/31/03, there were 12 funds in the Fund's asset category rated by Morningstar.

** Lipper, Inc. is an independent fund performance monitor. As of 12/31/02,
there were 9 funds in the Lipper Western European closed-end funds category,
which is comprised of funds that concentrate their investments in equity
securities whose primary trading markets or operations are in the Western
European region or a single country within this region.

1Performance  of funds is based on changes  in the  fund's NAV over a  specified
period.  In each case total return is calculated  assuming  reinvestment  of all
distributions.  Funds listed, other than Switzerland iShares, are not registered
with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Performance  and  descriptive
information  about the funds are derived from their published  investor  reports
and websites, which are subject to change.
2Switzerland  iShares  are traded on the New York Stock  Exchange  and invest in
most of the same  stocks  listed in the  Morgan  Stanley  Capital  International
(Switzerland)  Index.  These  stocks  represent  Switzerland's  largest and most
established  public  companies,  accounting for  approximately 85% of the market
capitalization  of all of Switzerland's  publicly traded stocks.  Performance of
iShares is calculated  based upon the December 31 closing prices each year using
the Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of noon each such date, as reported
by Bloomberg.  Such exchange rates were as follows:  12/31/96 = 1.35, 12/31/97 =
1.46,  12/31/98  = 1.38,  12/31/99  = 1.60,  12/31/00  = 1.61,  12/31/01 = 1.67,
12/31/02 = 1.39, and 12/31/03 = 1.24.
3 This fund  invests  in  equities  issued by  leading  Swiss  companies.  Stock
selection is based on economic, sector and company analyses. Preference is given
to large-cap companies.
4 This fund invests  primarily in major Swiss  companies.  Quality criteria used
for determining relative weightings of companies include: strategic orientation,
strength of market  position,  quality of  management,  soundness  of  earnings,
growth potential and potential for improving  shareholder  value. The investment
objective seeks to provide results that are aligned with the SPI performance.
5 This  fund  invests  in shares of Swiss  companies  listed on the Swiss  Stock
Exchange (SWX) and included in the SPI.
6 This fund invests in shares of Swiss companies.  It weights individual sectors
relative  to the SPI on the basis of their  expected  relative  performance.  It
focuses on liquid blue-chip stocks.
7These funds are not available for U.S. residents or citizens.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

life sciences  companies.  With this  acquisition  SGS is  building-up  its life
sciences  services and is establishing a presence in the North American  market,
both important steps for its growth strategy.

Several capital increases occurred this last quarter:

ABB: At an  extraordinary  meeting on November  20, 2003  shareholders  approved
share  capital  increase  expected to raise about $2.5 billion  through a rights
offering.   Shareholders   demonstrated  their  confidence  in  the  company  by

COMMENTS ON THE CURRENCY
U.S. DOLLAR: The dollar  depreciated  markedly against the other main currencies
of the world.  It fell by 20% against the euro,  10.5%  against the Swiss franc,
10%  against  the  British  pound and 10% versus  the yen.  The trade and budget
deficits  have been a source of concern for some time now, but the downside move
was triggered by the statements of U.S.  officials showing little willingness to
continue a strong dollar policy.

SWISS FRANC:  The Swiss franc vs. the U.S. dollar was flat during the first half
of the year and then  appreciated  by around 12% from the peak  exchange rate of
1.4174  at the end of August  to  1.2391  at the end of year.  The  Swiss  franc
weakened  considerably against the euro between March and July,  depreciating by
8% for the full year,  a decline  which  considerably  helped  Swiss  exports to
Euroland.

EURO: The European  Central Bank (ECB) changed its rate only one time during the
year,  from 2.5% to 2.0% in June.  The news did not have any  impact on the euro
since it had been expected for a long time. With inflation  steady at around 2%,
there is no indication  that the ECB will change policy for some time.  The euro
finished the year high with an exchange rate of 1.2595  against the U.S.  dollar
and of 1.56 against the Swiss franc.

OUTLOOK
     It is difficult to imagine a more favorable environment for stocks than the
one that  prevailed  during  the second  half of 2003.  As  inflexion  points in
earnings  expectations were reached,  the first incremental upward revision took
place.  With  extremely  low interest  rates and the threat of deflation  fading
away, no investment  vehicle could compete against stocks.  While price momentum
can be  expected  to carry  over in 2004,  investors  can look more  closely  at
valuations and analysts will have a tougher time increasing  earnings estimates.
In the Swiss and U.S. markets,  however, some segments that have performed below
average,  such  as  quality  names  in the  large  capitalization  area,  should
outperform as investors  become more risk  adverse.  While a flatter yield curve
may slow down  market  performance,  as long as  long-term  interest  rates stay
stable, stocks should continue to be attractive.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     Pursuant to  authorization  by its Board of Directors,  the Fund began open
market  purchases of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and
has continued  purchases in each subsequent  year. The principal  purpose of the
stock  repurchase  program is to enhance  stockholder  value by  increasing  the
Fund's net asset value per share without  creating a meaningful  adverse  effect
upon the Fund's  expense ratio and realizing  capital gains in order to fund the
repurchases. During the period ended December 31, 2003, the Fund repurchased and
retired  172,100  shares  at an  average  price of $10.62  per share  (including
brokerage  commissions)  and  a  weighted  average  discount  of  17.20%.  These
repurchases,  which had a total cost of  $1,827,374,  resulted in an increase of
$373,246 to the Fund's net asset value. The Board has authorized the purchase of
up to 500,000 shares in 2004.

   return  based on net asset value due to changes in the  relationship  between
   the Fund's market price and its net asset value per share.
4  The increase in the Fund's expense ratio was  attributable  to  extraordinary
   expenses in connection with a stockholder's proxy contest for the election of
   directors and  termination of the management  contract and defense  against a
   lawsuit  against the Fund and its  directors  plus the impact of a decline in
   the Fund's net assets.

Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE 1-ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss  Helvetia Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") is registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"),  as a  non-diversified,  closed-end
investment  management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The  investment  objective  of the Fund is to seek  long-term  growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity  securities,  the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity securities
that are not listed or that are listed  but have not  traded,  the Fund uses the
mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities,  the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the  calculation  of the Fund's net asset  value.  If a current bid price is not
available,  the Fund  uses the mean  between  the  latest  quoted  bid and asked
prices.  When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the  responsibility  of the Fund's  Board of  Directors  (the  "Board") to
establish fair valuation  procedures.  When valuing  securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that are
available are considered  unreliable,  the Fund  determines a fair value in good
faith in accordance with these procedures.  The Fund may use these procedures to
establish the fair value of securities  when, for example,  a significant  event
occurs  between  the time the  market  closes  and the time the Fund  values its
investments.  After  consideration  of various  factors,  the Fund may value the
securities at their last reported price or at some other value.  On December 31,
2003, there were no fair valued securities.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities  transactions  are  recorded  on the trade date.  Realized  gains and
losses are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend  income,  net  of  any  foreign  taxes  withheld,  is  recorded  on the
ex-dividend  date.  Interest  income,  including  amortization  of premiums  and
accretion of discounts,  is accrued daily.  Estimated  expenses are also accrued
daily.

The  Fund  records  Swiss  withholding  tax as an  expense,  net  of any  amount
receivable  from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax treaty between
the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends  annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and  net  realized   gains  from  foreign   currency   transactions   and  makes
distributions  of any net realized  capital  gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss  carryforwards.  The Fund  determines  the size and nature of these
distributions  in  accordance  with  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue  Code.
Distributions  may be paid  either  in cash or in stock  with an  option to take
cash.  The  Fund  records  dividends  and  distributions  on  its  books  on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue  Code that are  applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  and to
distribute all its taxable  income to its  stockholders.  Therefore,  no federal
income tax provision is required.

F. SECURITIES LENDING
The  Fund  may lend  securities  to  financial  institutions.  The Fund  retains
beneficial  ownership of the  securities  it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts  equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their  market  value.  For the initial  transaction,  the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish  collateral  with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or  government  securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

Subsequent  to the initial  transaction,  the Fund  requires  the  borrowers  to
maintain  collateral  with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of the securities
loaned.  The Fund  receives  fees as  compensation  for lending its  securities.
Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the  securities  loan at any time.
At December 31, 2003, securities valued at $4,325,850 were on loan to borrowers.
For  collateral,   the  Fund  received  U.S.  government  securities  valued  at
$4,436,250. Income generated from the program amounted to $36,118 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2003.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting  records in U.S. dollars.  The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency  denominated  assets,  liabilities and
transactions  by  using  prevailing   exchange  rates.  In  valuing  assets  and
liabilities,  the Fund uses the prevailing  exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing  securities  transactions,  the  receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized  gains and losses on foreign  currency  translations
shown on the  Fund's  financial  statements  result  from  the  sale of  foreign
currencies,  from  currency  gains or  losses  realized  between  the  trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between the
amounts of dividends,  interest,  and foreign  withholding taxes recorded on the
Fund's books and the U.S. dollar  equivalent of the amounts actually received or
paid.

When  calculating  realized and  unrealized  gains or losses on  investments  in
equity  securities,  the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the  foreign  currency  price of the  security  from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial  statements in conformity with accounting  principles
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  management  makes  estimates  and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 5-FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 2003,  accumulated  net investment  income and  accumulated  net
realized gain (loss) from  investments and foreign  currency  transactions  have
been adjusted for current  period  permanent  book/tax  differences  which arose
principally from differing book/tax treatments of foreign currency transactions.

At December 31, 2003, the net unrealized appreciation from investments for those
securities  having an excess of value over cost  (based on cost of  $170,447,162
for federal income tax purposes) was $190,851,837.  The difference  between book
basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation is attributable primarily to the tax
deferral of losses on wash sales.

income tax  regulations,  which may differ from  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

The tax character of distributions paid during 2003 and 2002 was as follows (see

NOTE 6-STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to  authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its  common  stock  on the New York  Stock  Exchange  in 1999 and has  continued
purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock repurchase
program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net asset value
per share without  creating a meaningful  adverse effect upon the Fund's expense
ratio and realizing  capital gains in order to fund the  repurchases.  The Board
has authorized  the purchase of up to 500,000 shares in 2004.  During the period
ended December 31, 2003, the Fund  repurchased  and retired 172,100 shares at an
average  price of  $10.62  per share  (including  brokerage  commissions)  and a
weighted average discount of 17.20%.  These repurchases,  which had a total cost
of  $1,827,374,  resulted  in an  increase  of  $373,246 to the Fund's net asset
value.

NOTE 7-LITIGATION
On April 2, 2001 and May 8, 2001, two complaints  were filed in purported  class
actions on behalf of  stockholders  of the Fund, in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware,  against the Fund,  each of its directors and HCC, the Fund's
Investment Advisor  (collectively,  the  "defendants").  The complaints in these
cases,  entitled  KIMBERLY KAHN V. PAUL  HOTTINGUER ET AL. and CHARLES MILLER V.
PAUL  HOTTINGUER ET AL.,  have been  voluntarily  dismissed by  plaintiffs  with
prejudice  pursuant to a settlement  agreement that was approved by the Delaware
Chancery Court on June 4, 2003. In the opinion of  management,  the terms of the
settlement did not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of
the Fund.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc.:

We have  audited the  accompanying  statement of assets and  liabilities  of The
Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc., including the schedule of investments, as of December
31, 2003,  and the related  statements of operations for the year then ended and
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the  financial  highlights  for each of the five years in the period then ended.
These financial  statements and financial  highlights are the  responsibility of
the  Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2003, by correspondence  with the custodian.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles used and significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audit provided a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of The
Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. as of December 31, 2003, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years
in the period  then ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the five
years in the  period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Additional Information (Unaudited)

This report is sent to the  stockholders  of The Swiss Helvetia  Fund,  Inc. for
their information.  It is not a prospectus,  circular or representation intended
for use in the  purchase  or sale of  shares  of the  Fund or of any  securities
mentioned in this report.

CODE OF ETHICS
The Board of Directors of the Fund and the Advisor have Adopted  Codes of Ethics
pursuant to provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Codes").  The
Codes  apply  to  the  personal  investing  activities  of  various  individuals
including directors and officers of the Fund and designated officers,  directors
and employees of the Advisor.  The provisions of the Codes place restrictions on
individuals who are involved in managing the Fund's portfolio,  who help execute
the portfolio manager's decisions or who come into possession of contemporaneous
information concerning the investment activities of the Fund.

The fundamental  principle of the Codes is that the  individuals  covered by the
Codes have a fiduciary responsibility to the Fund and its stockholders. They are
therefore  required  at all  times to place  the  interests  of the Fund and the
stockholders  first and to conduct all  personal  securities  transactions  in a
manner so as to avoid any actual or  potential  conflict of interest or abuse of
their position of trust.

Portfolio  managers and other  individuals  with  knowledge  of Fund  investment
activities  are  prohibited  from  purchasing  or  selling a  security  during a
blackout  period of 30 calendar days before and after the date on which the Fund
effects a trade in the same or a similar security. They are also prohibited from
engaging  in short term  trading of Swiss  equity or equity  linked  securities.
Additionally, the Fund's portfolio managers are prohibited from participating in
any initial  public  offering or private  placement  of Swiss  equity and equity
linked  securities  and other covered  individuals  must obtain prior  clearance
before doing so.

Any  individual  who violates the provisions of the Codes is required to reverse
the transaction and to turn over any resulting profits to the Fund. The Fund and
the Advisor have adopted  compliance  procedures and have  appointed  compliance
officers to ensure that all covered individuals comply with the Codes.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

THE PLAN
The Fund's Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest your capital gains  distributions  and ordinary income dividends
in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

     o    Once you  enroll in the Plan,  all of your  future  distributions  and
          dividends  payable  in whole or in part in cash will be  automatically
          reinvested in Fund shares.
     o    You will  receive  shares  valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset
          value or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount
          of your  distribution or dividend will be reinvested  automatically in
          additional  Fund  shares.  For any  balance  that is  insufficient  to
          purchase  full shares of the Fund,  your account will be credited with
          fractional shares.
     o    Your shares will be held in an account  with the Plan agent.  You will
          be sent regular statements for your records.
     o    You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

HOW DO I ENROLL IN THE PLAN?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company  (AST) at the address shown below.  If your shares are held in a
brokerage  account,  contact your broker.  Not all brokerage  firms permit their
clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the Plan and, even
if  your  brokerage  firm  does  permit  participation,  you  may not be able to
transfer your Plan shares to another  broker who does not permit  participation.
Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its policies.

HOW DOES THE PLAN WORK?
Any dividends or  distributions  you receive will be reinvested in shares of the
Fund.  The  number of shares  credited  to your Plan  account as a result of the
reinvestment  will depend upon the relationship  between the Fund's market price
and its net asset  value per share on the  record  date of the  distribution  or
dividend, as described below:

     o    If the net asset value is greater  than the market  price (the Fund is
          trading at a  discount),  AST as Plan Agent,  will buy Fund shares for
          your  account  on the open  market on the New York Stock  Exchange  or
          elsewhere.  Your dividends or distributions  will be reinvested at the
          average price AST pays for those purchases.
     o    If the net  asset  value is equal to the  market  price  (the  Fund is
          trading at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at
          net asset value.
     o    If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
          (the  Fund is  trading  at a premium  of less than 5%),  the Fund will
          issue for your account new shares at net asset value.
     o    If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market  price (the Fund
          is trading  at a premium of 5% or more),  the Fund will issue for your
          account new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST  begins to buy Fund  shares for your  account at a discount  to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price increases
to a level above the net asset  value,  AST will  complete its  purchases,  even
though the result may be that the average price paid for the  purchases  exceeds
net asset value.

WILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF MY DISTRIBUTION OR DIVIDEND BE REINVESTED?
The  entire  amount of your  distribution  or  dividend  will be  reinvested  in
additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase of whole shares,
your  account  will be credited  with any  fractional  shares  (rounded to three
decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

HOW CAN I SELL MY SHARES?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan  account by  contacting  AST.
AST charges $15 for the  transaction  plus $.10 per share for this service.  You
can also  withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

DOES  PARTICIPATION  IN THE PLAN  CHANGE THE TAX STATUS OF MY  DISTRIBUTIONS  OR
DIVIDENDS?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is the
same as it would be if you received the cash.  It is only after the payment that
AST reinvests the cash for your account.

share of  brokerage  commissions  incurred  with  respect to AST's  open  market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

HOW CAN I DISCONTINUE MY PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN?

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS

As of the end of the period,  December 31, 2003, the Swiss  Helvetia Fund,  Inc.
has adopted a code of ethics,  as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR,  that applies
to its  President  and  Treasurer.  A copy of the code of  ethics is filed as an
exhibit to this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board has determined that Samuel B. Witt, III, Stephen K. West
and Didier Pineau-Valencienne are "audit committee financial experts" and that
each such member is "independent" for purposes of this Item.


ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES - SWISS HELVETIA FUND

(a) The  aggregate  fees  billed  for  each of the last two  fiscal  years  (the
"Reporting  Periods") for  professional  services  rendered by the  Registrant's
principal  accountant  for  the  audit  of  the  Registrant's  annual  financial
statements,  or services that are normally provided by the principal  accountant
in connection  with the statutory and regulatory  filings or engagements for the
Reporting Periods, were $35,000 in 2002 and $34,500 in 2003.

(b) There were no  audit-related  fees billed to the Registrant in the Reporting
Periods for assurance and related services rendered by the principal  accountant
that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Registrant's
financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this Item 4.

There were no fees billed in the  Reporting  Periods for  assurance  and related
services  rendered by the principal  accountant to the  Registrant's  investment
adviser and any entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common control with
the  investment  adviser  that  provides  ongoing  services  to  the  Registrant
(collectively  the  "investment  adviser")  that are  reasonably  related to the
performance  of the  audit of the  Registrant's  financial  statements,  are not
reported under paragraph (a) of this Item 4 and were required to be pre-approved
by the audit committee as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this Item 4.

(c) The aggregate fees billed in the Reporting Periods for professional services
rendered by the principal  accountant to the Registrant for tax compliance,  tax
advice and tax  planning  ("Tax  Services")  were $1,000 in 2002 and $0 in 2003.
These services consisted of review or preparation of U.S. federal,  state, local
and excise tax returns.

 (d) The  aggregate  fees  billed in the  Reporting  Periods  for  products  and
services provided by the principal accountant to the Registrant,  other than the
services  reported in paragraphs  (a) through (c) of this Item,  were $0 in 2002
and $17,600 in 2003.  These  services  related to work  performed  for  internal
control consulting services.

(e) (1) The Registrant's Audit Committee pre-approves the principal accountant's
engagements  for audit and non-audit  services to the  Registrant  and non-audit
services  to  the  investment  adviser  on a  case-by-case  basis  as  required.
Pre-approval considerations include whether the proposed services are compatible
with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

(e) (2) No  services  included  in (b) - (d) above  were  approved  pursuant  to
paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

(f) None.

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the principal accountant for services
rendered to the  Registrant  for the  Reporting  Periods were $1,000 in 2002 and
$17,600 in 2003. There were no fees billed in each of the Reporting  Periods for
non-audit  services  rendered  by the  principal  accountant  to the  investment
adviser.

(h) The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of any
non-audit   services   rendered  to  the  investment   adviser  which  were  not
pre-approved  (not requiring  pre-approval)  is compatible with  maintaining the
principal accountant's independence.


ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

Not Applicable.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]


ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


         The Registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio
holdings to its investment adviser, Hottinger Capital Corp. (the "Advisor"), to
vote the Registrant's proxies in accordance with Advisor's proxy voting
guidelines and procedures. The Advisor has adopted proxy voting guidelines (the
"Voting Guidelines") that provide as follows:

o        The Advisor votes proxies in respect of a client's securities in the
         client's best economic interests and without regard to the interests of
         the Advisor or any other client of the Advisor.

o        Unless the Advisor's Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") otherwise
         determines (and documents the basis for its decision) or as otherwise
         provided below, the Advisor votes proxies in a manner consistent with
         the Voting Guidelines.

o        To avoid material conflicts of interest, the Advisor applies the Voting
         Guidelines in an objective and consistent manner across client accounts
         Where  a  material conflict  of interest  has  been  identified and the
         matter  is  covered  by  the  Voting Guidelines, the Committee votes in
         accordance with the Voting Guidelines. Where a conflict of interest has
         been identified and the matter is not covered by the Voting Guidelines,
         the Advisor will disclose the conflict and the Committee's
         determination of the manner in which to vote to the Fund's Audit
         Committee.

o        The Advisor also may determine not to vote proxies in respect of
         securities of any issuer if it determines that it would be in the
         client's overall best interests not to vote.

         The Advisor's Voting Guidelines address how it will vote proxies on
particular types of matters such as the election for directors, adoption of
option plans and anti-takeover proposals. For example, the Advisor generally
will:

o        support management in most elections for directors, unless the board
         gives evidence of acting contrary to the best economic interests of
         shareholders;

o        support option plans, if it believes that they provide for their
         administration by disinterested parties and provide incentive to
         directors, managers and other employees by aligning their economic
         interests with those of the shareholders while limiting the transfer of
         wealth out of the company; and

o        oppose anti-takeover proposals unless they are structured in such a way
         that they give shareholders the ultimate decision on any proposal or
         offer.


ITEM 8. [RESERVED]


ITEM 9. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) The registrant's President and Treasurer have concluded that the
registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 30a-3(c)
under the Act) are effective in design and operation and are sufficient to form
the basis of the certifications required by Rule 30a-(2) under the Act, based on
their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days of
the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act), or the internal control
over financial reporting of its service providers during the last fiscal half
year (the registrant's second half year in the case of an annual report) that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.


ITEM 10. EXHIBITS.

(a) (1) A copy of the Code of Ethics (Exhibit filed herewith).

(a) (2) Certifications pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(Exhibit filed herewith).

(b)  Certifications  pursuant to Section 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002

                          THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.    Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

      This code of ethics (the "Code") for The Swiss  Helvetia  Fund, Inc.  (the
"Fund")  applies  to  the  Fund's  Principal  Executive  Officer  and  Principal
Financial Officer,  or other persons performing similar functions,  each of whom
is listed on Exhibit A (the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

      o honest and ethical conduct, including  the ethical handling of actual or
        apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between  personal  and  professional
        relationships;

      o full, fair,  accurate,  timely  and understandable disclosure in reports
        and  documents that the Fund files with,  or  submits to, the Securities
        and Exchange Commission  (the  "SEC") and in other public communications
        made by the Fund;

      o compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

      o the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of the Code to an
        appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      o accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer  should adhere to a high standard of business  ethics
and should be  sensitive to  situations  that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   Covered  Officers Should  Handle  Ethically  Actual and Apparent Conflicts
      of Interest


      Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his service to, the Fund.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

      Certain conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  "Investment
Company  Act"),  and the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  as  amended  (the
"Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain  transactions  (such as the purchase or sale of  securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund.  The  compliance  programs and  procedures  of the Fund and the Fund's
investment  advisor (the  "Advisor")  are  designed to prevent,  or identify and
correct,  violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures.

<PAGE>


      Although typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the Fund and the Advisor of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary  course  of  their  duties  (whether  formally  for the Fund or for the
Advisor,   or  for  both),  will  be  involved  in  establishing   policies  and
implementing  decisions that will have different  effects on the Advisor and the
Fund. The  participation  of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the  contractual  relationship  between  the  Fund  and  the  Advisor  and is
consistent  with the  performance  by the Covered  Officers  of their  duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity  with the provisions of the
Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically.

      Other  conflicts  of  interest  are  covered  by  the  Code,  even if such
conflicts  of  interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company
Act and the Investment Advisers  Act.  Covered Officers should keep in mind that
the Code cannot enumerate every possible scenario.  The overarching principle of
the Code is that  the  personal  interest  of a  Covered  Officer  should not be
placed improperly before the interest of the Fund.

      Each Covered Officer must:

      o not use his personal influence or personal relationships  improperly to
        influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the Fund
        whereby  the Covered  Officer would  benefit personally to the detriment
        of the Fund;

      o not cause the  Fund to  take action, or fail to take action, for the
        individual  personal  benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
        benefit of the Fund; and

      o not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
        potential violations that are made in good faith.

III.  Disclosure and Compliance

      o Each Covered Officer should familiarize  himself with the disclosure
        requirements  and  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  generally
        applicable to the Fund within his area of responsibility;

      o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause  others
        to  misrepresent,  facts about  the Fund to others,  whether  within  or
        outside the Fund, including to  the Fund's  Board members and  auditors,
        and to  governmental regulators  and  self-regulatory organizations; and

      o to the extent appropriate  within his area of  responsibility,  each
        Covered  Officer should consult with other officers and employees of
        the Fund and the Advisor and take other  appropriate steps  with the
        goal  of  promoting  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
        disclosure  in  the  reports  and  documents the Fund files with, or
        submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made by the
        Fund; and


                                      -2-

<PAGE>


      o it  is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to  promote
        compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
        laws, rules and regulations.

IV.   Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

      o upon  adoption  of the  Code (or  thereafter,  as  applicable,  upon
        becoming  a Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing to the Board that
        he has received, read, and understands the Code;

      o annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
        requirements of the Code; and

      o notify the Audit Committee (the "Committee") promptly if he knows of any
        violation  of  the  Code. Failure to do so is  itself a violation of the
        Code.

      The Audit  Committee  is responsible  for  applying  the Code to  specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any  particular  situation and to grant waivers  sought by
any Covered Officer.  The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing the Code:

      o the Committee will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
        potential violations reported to it;

      o if, after such investigation, the Committee believes that  no  violation
        has  occurred, the Committee is not required to take any further action;

      o if  the  Committee  determines  that  a violation  has occurred, it will
        inform and make a  recommendation  to the  Board,  which  will  consider
        appropriate  action, which  may  include  review  of,  and   appropriate
        modifications to, applicable policies and  procedures;  notification  to
        appropriate personnel of the Advisor or its  board; or a  recommendation
        to dismiss the Covered Officer; and

      o any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent  required, will
        be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V.    Other Policies and Procedures

      The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  and the  rules  and  forms
applicable  to  registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar as other
policies and  procedures  of the Fund,  the Advisor or other  service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are subject to the Code,  they are superceded by the Code to the extent that
they overlap or conflict  with the  provisions  of the Code.  The Fund's and the
Advisor's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment  Company Act and
the  Advisor's  additional  policies and  procedures  are separate  requirements
applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.



                                      -3-
<PAGE>


VI.   Amendments

      Except as  to  Exhibit  A,  the  Code may not be amended except in written
form, which  is  specifically  approved or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the
Fund's Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII.  Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will
be considered confidential and shall be  maintained and  protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required  by law or the Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed  to  anyone  other  than the  Fund  and its  counsel,  the  Board  (or
Committees thereof) and its counsel, and the Advisor.

VIII. Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
