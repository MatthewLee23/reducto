Dividend Reinvestment Plans

Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC, at
800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If you have
shares registered in a "street" name, contact your financial advisor or the
broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund, and Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, all distributions
of net investment income and capital gains to common stock shareholders are
automatically reinvested in additional shares unless shareholders elect to
receive all dividends and other distributions in cash paid by check mailed
directly to shareholders by the dividend plan agent. Under the current policies
of Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, distributions of net investment
income and capital gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash unless
shareholders notify Mellon Investor Services LLC of their desire to participate
in the dividend reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.
You can contact Mellon at:

    Funds are not FDIC insured and are not guaranteed. It is possible to lose
    the principal amount invested.

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

    Generally, total investment return based on net asset value will be higher
    than total investment return based on market value in periods where there is
    an increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value
    to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.
    Conversely, total investment return based on net asset value will be lower
    than total investment return based on market value in periods where there is
    a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value
    to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common
    shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(1) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

    Generally, total investment return based on net asset value will be higher
    than total investment return based on market value in periods where there is
    an increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value
    to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.
    Conversely, total investment return based on net asset value will be lower
    than total investment return based on market value in periods where there is
    a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value
    to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders divided by average net assets applicable to common
    shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by the Funds.

Security Valuation - Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of each Fund's Board of
Directors/Trustees. In determining whether market quotations are readily
available or fair valuation will be used, various factors will be taken into
consideration, such as market closures, aftermarket trading or significant
events after local market trading (e.g., government actions or pronouncements,
trading volume or volatility on markets, exchanges among dealers, or news
events).

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (Statement 157). Statement 157
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, clarifies the definition of fair value within that
framework, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
Statement 157 is intended to increase consistency and comparability among fair
value estimates used in financial reporting. Statement 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management does not expect the
adoption of Statement 157 to have an impact on the amounts reported in the
financial statements.

Federal Income Taxes - Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. Although the Funds' tax
positions are currently being evaluated, management does not expect the adoption
of FIN 48 to have a material impact on the Funds' financial statements.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Other - Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged directly to that
Fund. Other expenses common to various funds within the Delaware Investments(R)
Family of Funds are generally allocated amongst such funds on the basis of
average net assets. Management fees and some other expenses are paid monthly.
Security transactions are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or
sold (trade date) for financial reporting purposes. Costs used in calculating
realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are those of the
specific securities sold. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.
Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income over the lives of the
respective securities. Each Fund declares and pays dividends from net investment
income monthly and distributions from net realized gain on investments, if any,
at least annually. In addition, in order to satisfy certain distribution
requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Funds may declare special
year-end dividend and capital gains distributions during November or December to
shareholders of record on a date in such month. Such distributions, if received
by shareholders by January 31, are deemed to have been paid by the Funds and
received by shareholders on the earlier of the date paid or December 31 of the
prior year.

The Funds receive earnings credits from their custodian when positive cash
balances are maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. The expense paid
under the above arrangement is included in custodian fees on the Statements of
Operations with the corresponding expense offset shown as "expense paid
indirectly."

2. Investment Management, Administration Agreements and Other Transactions with
   Affiliates

In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%,
which is calculated daily based on the average weekly net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

Delaware Service Company, Inc. (DSC), an affiliate of DMC, provides accounting
and administration services. Each Fund pays DSC a monthly fee computed at the
annual rate of 0.04% of the Fund's average daily net assets for accounting and
administration services.

At September 30, 2006, each Fund had liabilities payable to affiliates as
follows:

 Such expenses include items such as printing of shareholder reports, fees for audit, legal and tax services, stock exchange fees,
 custodian fees and directors/trustees' fees.
</TABLE>

As provided in the investment management agreement, each Fund bears the cost of
certain legal and tax services, including internal legal and tax services
provided to each Fund by DMC and/or its' affiliates employees. For the six
months ended September 30, 2006, each Fund was charged for internal legal and
tax services by DMC as follows:

</TABLE>

Directors/Trustees' Fees and Benefits include expenses accrued by the Funds for
each Directors/Trustee's retainer, per meeting fees and retirement benefits.
Independent Directors/Trustees with over five years of uninterrupted service are
eligible to participate in a retirement plan that provides for the payment of
benefits upon retirement. The amount of the retirement benefit is based on
factors set forth in the plan including the number of years of service. On
November 16, 2006, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Fund unanimously voted
to terminate the retirement plan. Payments equal to the net present value of the
earned benefits will be made in 2007 to those independent directors/trustees and
retired independent directors/trustees so entitled. The retirement benefit
payout for the Arizona Municipal Fund, Colorado Insured Municipal Fund, Florida
Insured Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund II are $5,506, $9,218,
$4,431 and $21,329, respectively. Certain officers of DMC and DSC are officers
and/or directors/trustees of the Funds. These officers and directors/trustees
are paid no compensation by the Funds.

The differences between book basis and tax basis components of net assets are
primarily attributable to tax deferral of losses on wash sales and tax treatment
of market discount on debt instruments.

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the
tax character of permanent book/tax differences. Reclassifications are primarily
due to tax treatment of dividends and distributions and market discount on
certain debt instruments. Results of operations and net assets were not affected
by these reclassifications. For the six months ended September 30, 2006, the
Funds recorded an estimate of these differences since the final tax
characteristics cannot be determined until fiscal year end.

5. Capital Stock

Pursuant to their articles of incorporation, Arizona Municipal Fund, Colorado
Insured Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund II each have 200 million
shares of $0.01 par value common shares authorized. Florida Insured Municipal
Fund has been authorized to issue an unlimited amount of $0.01 par value common
shares. The Funds did not repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase
Program during the six months ended September 30, 2006. Shares issuable under
the Funds' dividend reinvestment plan are purchased by the Funds' transfer
agent, Mellon Investor Services, LLC, in the open market.

For the six months ended September 30, 2006, the Funds did not have any
transactions in common shares.

The Funds each have one million shares of $0.01 par value preferred shares
authorized, except for Florida Insured Municipal Fund, which has an unlimited
amount of $0.01 par value preferred shared authorized. On May 14, 1993, Arizona
Municipal Fund and Florida Insured Municipal Fund issued 500 and 400 preferred
shares, respectively. Also on that date, Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued 600
Series A and 600 Series B preferred shares. On September 23, 1993, Colorado
Insured Municipal Fund issued 800 preferred shares. The preferred shares of each
Fund have a liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount equal to
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

In connection with the reorganizations described in Note 6 on the next page,
shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund II approved amendments to its charter
to create two new series to absorb the preferred stock of Delaware Investments
Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund") and Delaware
Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund
III"). These new series have identical rights and preferences (including
liquidation rights) in all material respects to the preferred shares of
Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III, and are substantially
similar to the Series A and B preferred shares of Minnesota Municipal Fund II
with respect to their preferences, voting powers, restrictions, limitation as to
dividends, qualifications, liquidation rights, and term and conditions of
redemption.

Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued 400 Series C Preferred Shares to preferred
shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund in exchange for that Fund's preferred
shares and 300 Series D Preferred Shares to preferred shareholders of Minnesota
Municipal Fund III in exchange for that Fund's preferred shares at the close of
the reorganization on February 24, 2006.

Dividends for the outstanding preferred shares of each Fund are cumulative at a
rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the six months ended September 30,
2006 as follows:

Fund                                                  Low             High

Florida Insured Municipal Fund                        3.00%    to     4.20%

Notes to financial statements


Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds


5. Capital Stock (continued)

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (formerly Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.), and
Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. (Colorado Insured Municipal Fund
only), as the remarketing agents, receive an annual fee from each of the Funds
of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred stock outstanding.

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant to Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassificiation as a closed-end
investment company or (c) changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. Fund Reorganization

At the close of business on February 24, 2006, Minnesota Municipal Fund II
acquired substantially all of the assets of Minnesota Municipal Fund and
Minnesota Municipal Fund III, each pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Acquisition (the "Reorganization"). The common shareholders of Minnesota
Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III each received common shares of
Minnesota Municipal Fund II equal to the aggregate net asset value of their
respective shares prior to the Reorganization. The preferred shares of Minnesota
Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III received the same number of
Series C and Series D preferred shares, respectively, of Minnesota Municipal
Fund II as they held in their respective Funds prior to the Reorganization (see
Note 5). The Reorganizations were treated as non-taxable events and,
accordingly, Minnesota Municipal Fund II's basis in the securities acquired
reflected the historical cost basis as of the date of transfer. The net assets,
net unrealized appreciation and accumulated net realized gain (loss) of
Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III as of the close of
business on February 24, 2006, were as follows:

                                              Net Unrealized    Accumulated Net
                                 Net Assets    Appreciation   Realized Gain/Loss
                               _____________  ______________  __________________

Minnesota Municipal Fund        $38,077,404     $2,648,640          $ 2,145
Minnesota Municipal Fund III     25,566,621      1,999,455          (81,744)

The net assets of Minnesota Municipal Fund II prior to the Reorganization were
$108,531,274. The combined net assets of Minnesota Municipal Fund II after the
Reorganization were $172,175,299.

Minnesota Municipal Fund II will continue to trade and to be listed on the
American Stock Exchange. Beginning on February 27, 2006 and going forward,
however, Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III will no
longer trade or be listed on the American Stock Exchange, and their corporate
existence will be liquidated and dissolved. In January 2007, shareholders of
Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III will receive Form
1099-DIV that will report the amount and character of each Fund's distributions
paid in calendar year 2006.

Common and preferred shares of Minnesota Municipal Fund II issued to
shareholders of Minnesota Municipal Fund and Minnesota Municipal Fund III in
connection with the Reorganization were as follows:

</TABLE>

7. Credit and Market Risk

The Funds use leverage in the form of preferred shares. Leveraging may result in
a higher degree of volatility because each Fund's net asset value could be more
sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates and changes in market
value of portfolio securities attributable to the leverage.

The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the states, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels
of supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment
for their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.


24


<page>


7. Credit and Market Risk (continued)

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are identified on the Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in advanced refunded bonds, escrow secured bonds or
defeased bonds. Under current federal tax laws and regulations, state and local
government borrowers are permitted to refinance outstanding bonds by issuing new
bonds. The issuer refinances the outstanding debt to either reduce interest
costs or to remove or alter restrictive covenants imposed by the bonds being
refinanced. A refunding transaction where the municipal securities are being
refunded within 90 days from the issuance of the refunding issue is known as a
"current refunding". "Advance refunded bonds" are bonds in which the refunded
bond issue remains outstanding for more than 90 days following the issuance of
the refunding issue. In an advance refunding, the issuer will use the proceeds
of a new bond issue to purchase high grade interest bearing debt securities
which are then deposited in an irrevocable escrow account held by an escrow
agent to secure all future payments of principal and interest and bond premium
of the advance refunded bond. Bonds are "escrowed to maturity" when the proceeds
of the refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for investment
sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest on the original interest
payment and maturity dates.

Bonds are considered "pre-refunded" when the refunding issue's proceeds are
escrowed only until a permitted call date or dates on the refunded issue with
the refunded issue being redeemed at the time, including any required premium.
Bonds become "defeased" when the rights and interests of the bondholders and of
their lien on the pledged revenues or other security under the terms of the bond
contract are substituted with an alternative source of revenues (the escrow
securities) sufficient to meet payments of principal and interest to maturity or
to the first call dates. Escrowed secured bonds will often receive a rating of
AAA from Moody's Investor's Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Group,
and/or Fitch Ratings due to the strong credit quality of the escrow securities
and the irrevocable nature of the escrow deposit agreement.

Each Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in illiquid securities, which
may include securities with contractual restrictions on resale, securities
exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and other securities which may not be readily marketable. The relative
illiquidity of these securities may impair each Fund from disposing of them in a
timely manner and at a fair price when it is necessary or desirable to do so.
While maintaining oversight, each Fund's Board of Trustees/Directors has
delegated to DMC the day-to-day functions of determining whether individual
securities are liquid for purposes of each Fund's limitation on investments in
illiquid assets. At September 30, 2006, there were no Rule 144A securities and
no securities have been determined to be illiquid under each Fund's Liquidity
Procedures.

8. Contractual Obligations

The Funds enter into contracts in the normal course of business that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts. Management has reviewed the Funds' existing
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.


                                                                              25

 Director/Trustee and one of the nominees for election to the Board of each Fund, resigned from the Board
 of each Fund, effective August 1, 2006. As a result, Mr. Driscoll withdrew from the election. At a
 regularly scheduled Board meeting on August 16, 2006, each Fund's Nominating Committee recommended to the

Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds


Board Consideration of Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds
Investment Advisory Agreement

At a meeting held on May 17-18,2006 (the "Annual Meeting"), the Board of
Trustees/Directors ("Trustees"), including a majority of disinterested or
independent Trustees, approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreements
for the Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc.; Delaware
Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.; Delaware Investments
Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund; and Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds"). In
making its decision, the Board considered information furnished throughout the
year at regular Board meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in
connection with the Annual Meeting. Information furnished and discussed
throughout the year included reports detailing Fund performance, investment
strategies, expenses, compliance matters and other services provided by Delaware
Management Company ("DMC"), the investment advisor. Information furnished
specifically in connection with the Annual Meeting included materials provided
by DMC and its affiliates ("Delaware Investments") concerning, among other
things, the level of services provided to the Funds, the costs of such services
to the Funds, economies of scale and the financial condition and profitability
of Delaware Investments. In addition, in connection with the Annual Meeting, the
Board considered independent historical and comparative reports prepared by
Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent statistical compilation organization. The
Board also considered industry comparative information presented by
representatives from Lipper. The Lipper reports compared each Fund's investment
performance and expenses with those of other comparable mutual funds. The Board
also received certain supplemental information regarding management's policy
with respect to advisory fee levels and its philosophy with respect to
breakpoints; the structure of portfolio manager compensation; and any
constraints or limitations on the availability of securities in certain
investment styles which might inhibit DMC's ability to fully invest in
accordance with Fund policies.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel and representatives from
Lipper. At the meeting with representatives from Lipper, Mr. Driscoll, then
Chairman of the Delaware Investments Family of Funds, and Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the investment advisor, was present to respond to questions
by Lipper and the independent Trustees. While the Board considered the
Investment Advisory Agreements for all of the funds in the Delaware Investments
Family of Funds at the same Board meeting, information was provided and
considered by the Board for each fund individually. In approving the continuance
of the Investment Advisory Agreement for each Fund, the Board, including a
majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing advisory fee
structure was fair and reasonable and that the continuance of the Investment
Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.
While attention was given to all information furnished, the following discusses
the primary factors relevant to the Board's deliberations and determination,
including those relating to the selection of the investment advisor and the
approval of the advisory fee.

Nature, Extent and Quality Of Service. Consideration was given to the services
provided by Delaware Investments to the Funds and their shareholders. In
reviewing the nature, extent and quality of services, the Board emphasized
reports furnished to it throughout the year at regular Board meetings covering
matters such as the compliance of portfolio managers with the investment
policies, strategies and restrictions for the Funds, the compliance of
management personnel with the Code of Ethics adopted throughout the Delaware
Investments Family of Funds complex, the adherence to fair value pricing
procedures as established by the Board and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. The Board noted that it was pleased with the current staffing of
the Funds' investment advisor during the past year, the emphasis on research and
the compensation system for advisory personnel. Favorable consideration was
given to DMC's efforts to maintain, and in some instances increase, financial
and human resources committed to fund matters. Other factors taken into account
by the Board were Delaware Investments' preparedness for, and response to, legal
and regulatory matters. The Board was satisfied with the nature, extent and
quality of the overall services provided by Delaware Investments.

Investment Performance. The Board considered the investment performance of DMC
and the Funds. The Board was pleased by DMC's investment performance. The Board
placed significant emphasis on the investment performance of the Funds in view
of its importance to shareholders. While consideration was given to performance
reports and discussions with portfolio managers at Board meetings throughout the
year, particular weight was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the Annual
Meeting. The Lipper reports prepared for each Fund showed the investment
performance of its shares in comparison to a group of similar funds as selected
by Lipper (the "Performance Universe"). A fund with the highest performance is
ranked first, and a fund with the lowest is ranked last. The highest/best
performing 25% of funds in the Performance Universe make up the first quartile;
the next 25% - the second quartile; the next 25% - the third quartile; and the
lowest/worst performing 25% of funds in the Performance Universe make up the
fourth quartile. Comparative annualized performance for the Fund was shown for
the past one, three, five and 10 year periods ended January 31,2006. The Board
noted its objective that each Fund's performance for the periods considered be
at or above the median of its Performance Universe. The following paragraph
summarizes the performance results for the Funds and the Board's view of such
performance.

Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. - The Performance
Universe for the Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end other
states municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report comparison
showed that the Fund's total return for the one and three year periods was in
the fourth quartile of such Performance Universe. The report further showed that
the Fund's total return for the five and 10 year periods was in the second
quartile. The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were mixed, but on
an overall basis tended toward median, which was acceptable.

Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. - The
Performance Universe for the Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged
closed-end other states municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper
report comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one and three year
periods was in the fourth quartile of such Performance Universe. The report
further showed that the Fund's total return for the five and 10 year periods was
in the second and first quartiles, respectively. The Board noted that the Fund's
performance results were mixed, but on an overall basis tended toward median,
which was acceptable.

Board Consideration of Delaware Investments Closed-End Municipal Bond Funds
Investment Advisory Agreement (continued)

Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund - The Performance
Universe for the Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end Florida
municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report comparison showed
that the Fund's total return for the one year period was in the third quartile
of such Performance Universe. The report further showed that the Fund's total
return for the three and five year periods was in the forth quartile and the
Fund's total return for the 10 year period was in the second quartile. The Board
noted that the Fund's performance results were not in line with the Board's
objective. The Board also noted that the Performance Universe is not comprised
solely of insured funds. Many of the funds (even certain of the insured funds)
in the Performance Universe can maintain exposure to BBB rated bonds, which have
significantly outperformed the AAA rated bonds that the Fund invests in. Based
upon the Fund's investment restrictions and the composition of the Performance
Universes, the Board was satisfied with the Fund's performance results.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. - The Performance
Universe for the Fund consisted of the Fund and all leveraged closed-end
Minnesota municipal debt funds as selected by Lipper. The Lipper report
comparison showed that the Fund's total return for the one year period was
ranked third of the three funds in the Performance Universe. The report further
showed that the Fund's total return for the three year period ranked first of
the three funds in the Performance Universe and the Fund's total return for the
five and 10 year periods ranked first of the two funds in the Performance
Universe. The Board noted that the Fund's performance results were mixed, but on
an overall basis, tended toward median, which was acceptable.

Comparative Expenses. The Board considered expense comparison data for the
Delaware Investments Family of Funds. Management provided the Board with
information on pricing levels and fee structures for the Funds. The Board
focused particularly on the comparative analysis of the management fees and
total expense ratios of each Fund and the management fees and expense ratios of
a group of similar leveraged closed-end funds as selected by Lipper (the
"Expense Group"). In reviewing comparative costs, each Fund's contractual
management fee and the actual management fee incurred by the Fund were compared
with the contractual management fees (assuming all funds in the Expense Group
were similar in size to the Fund) and actual management fees (as reported by
each fund) of other funds within the Expense Group, taking into effect any
applicable breakpoints and fee waivers. Each Fund's total expenses were also
compared with those of its Expense Group. The Board also considered fees paid to
Delaware Investments for non-management services. The Board noted its objective
to limit each Fund's total expense ratio to an acceptable range as compared to
the median of the Expense Group. The following paragraph summarizes the expense
results for the Funds and the Board's view of such expenses.

Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc. - The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its actual management fee and total
expenses were in the quartile with the second lowest expenses of its Expense
Group. The Board was satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of
the Fund in comparison to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. - The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee was in the quartile with
the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group and its total expenses were in
the quartile with the lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board was
satisfied with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in comparison
to its Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund - The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee was in the quartile with
the lowest expenses of its Expense Group and its total expenses were in the
quartile with the second lowest of its Expense Group. The Board was satisfied
with the management fees and total expenses of the Fund in comparison to its
Expense Group as shown in the Lipper report.

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. - The expense
comparisons for the Fund showed that its management fee was in the quartile with
the second highest expenses of its Expense Group and its total expenses were in
the quartile with the second lowest expenses of its Expense Group. The Board was
satisfied with the total expenses of the Fund in comparison to its Expense Group
as shown in the Lipper report.

Management Profitability. The Board considered the level of profits, if any,
realized by Delaware Investments in connection with the operation of the Funds.
In this respect, the Board reviewed the Investment Management Profitability
Analysis that addressed the overall profitability of Delaware Investments'
business in providing management and other services to each of the individual
funds and the Delaware Investments Family of Funds as a whole. Specific
attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating costs for the
purpose of determining profitability. Management stated that the level of
profits of Delaware Investments, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by Delaware Investments. The Board considered
Delaware Investments' expenditures to improve services provided to fund
shareholders and to meet additional regulatory and compliance requirements
resulting from recent SEC initiatives. The Board also considered the extent to
which Delaware Investments might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations,
including the potential for procuring additional business as a result of the
prestige and visibility associated with its role as service provider to the
Delaware Investments Family of Funds, the benefits from allocation of fund
brokerage to improve trading efficiencies and the use of "soft" commission
dollars to pay for proprietary and non-proprietary research. The Board did not
find that the level of profits realized by Delaware Investments from the
relationships with the Funds and the Delaware Investments Family of Funds
required negotiation of reduction fees.

Economies of Scale. As a closed-end fund, each Fund does not issue shares on a
continuous basis. Fund assets increase only to the extent that the value of the
underlying securities in the Fund increase. Accordingly, the Board determined
that the Funds were not likely to experience significant economies of scale due
to asset growth and, therefore, a fee schedule with breakpoints to pass the
benefit of such economies of scale on to shareholders was not likely to provide
the intended effect.


                                                                              29

               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

               registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
               known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared;

               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

          (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure

               control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
               fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
               materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
               information; and

          (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
