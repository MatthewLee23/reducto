     and shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the
     same residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
     "householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

     DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
     ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

     please contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial
     adviser.

     Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton
     Vance documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance
     or your financial adviser.

From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND as of October 31, 2003

INVESTMENT UPDATE

INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT

- -  The bank loan market has benefited from a stronger economy. Industrial and
   technology companies have begun to see an increase in orders in response to a
   renewal of capital spending. In addition, companies that cut costs and
   restructured their debt during the economic slowdown are now beginning to see
   the benefits of those moves, as business activity gathers steam. Finally,
   consumer and investor confidence has increased, as corporate governance
   issues are being addressed by regulators and businesses alike. Together,
   these trends have contributed to a better credit climate and a stronger loan
   market.

- -  The mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sector performed poorly during the
   period, primarily due to a sharp rise in prepayment rates. Re-financings
   surged, as homeowners rushed to take advantage of the lowest interest rates
   in 45 years. As a consequence, the price performance of MBS investments was
   impaired.

- -  The improving economy provided a lift for the high-yield market in the second
   half of 2003. Tax cuts and low interest rates also provided a boost. As an
   indication of the economy's recovery in the second half, third quarter Gross
   Domestic Product (GDP) rose 8.2%, marking the nation's fastest growth rate in
   two decades. Finally, default rates - which rose during the economic slowdown
   - have declined significantly, reflecting the improved credit conditions.

THE FUND

   PERFORMANCE
- -  Based on the Fund's October 2003 monthly dividend of $0.1345 and a closing
   share price of $18.78, the Fund had a market yield of 8.59%.(1) The Fund's
   market yield represented a yield advantage over many other income-producing
   vehicles.

   THE FUND'S INVESTMENTS
- -  The Fund's managers have emphasized broad diversification across industries,
   with investments in economically-sensitive, cyclical sectors, as well as more
   defensive areas. At October 31, 2003, the Fund's investments represented 43
   industries, with no single sector accounting for as much as 10% of the Fund.
   The largest sectors were broadcasting and entertainment; health care and
   childcare; education; telecommunications; leisure, amusement and
   entertainment; and hotels, motels, inns and gaming.

- -  Among the Fund's largest floating-rate loans were companies that we believe
   are likely to benefit from an economic recovery. For example, broadcasting
   companies, publishers and printers should benefit from an increase in
   advertising budgets. Another economically-sensitive area was containers and
   packaging. As companies ship more products, there is rising demand for
   containerboard and other packaging materials. In a less GDP-sensitive area,
   the Fund had an investment in health care, including an operator of dialysis
   centers for kidney patients. The company has benefited from a rising number
   of procedures and a higher fee schedule.

- -  Among its high-yield bond investments, the Fund had significant investments
   in telecommunications and broadcasting companies. Wireless companies have
   completed the build-out of their networks and are becoming cash-flow positive
   for the first time in years. The Fund also had large investments in utility
   bonds, including energy pipeline companies and power generating companies
   that took steps to pare debt and improve short-term liquidity. By
   restructuring bank debt, issuing equity and repurchasing their own bonds,
   these companies have improved their balance sheets and enhanced their access
   to the capital markets.

- -  The Fund's performance was adversely affected by the difficult MBS market.
   Prepayment rates rose sharply not only for generic MBS, but also among the
   Fund's seasoned MBS, which have historically displayed much more predictable
   prepay rates. However, we believe that interest rates have likely bottomed
   and that it is probable that the majority of re-financings have already
   occurred. Accordingly, we would expect that prepayment rates would ease
   dramatically and provide a better climate for MBS investments relative to
   other high-grade, fixed-income sectors.

(1) The Fund's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
    per share by the share market price at the end of the period and annualizing
    the result. (2) Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the
    percentage change in market value or net asset value with all distributions
    reinvested. (3) Five Largest Sector Weightings account for 36.6% of the
    Fund's net assets, determined by dividing the total market value of the
    holdings by the net assets of the Fund. Five Largest Sector Weightings refer
    only to senior floating-rate loan and corporate bond portions of the Fund
    and are subject to change.

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and
    principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more
    or less than their original cost.

The views expressed in this report are those of the portfolio managers and are
current only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover.
These views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other
conditions, and Eaton Vance disclaims any responsibility to update such views.
These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment
decisions for an Eaton Vance fund are based on many factors, may not be relied
on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Eaton Vance fund.

Shares of the Fund are not insured by the FDIC and are not deposits or other
obligations of, or guaranteed by, any depository institution. Shares are subject
to investment risks, including possible loss of principal invested. Yield will
change.

(1)  Senior floating rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
     flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
     borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election,
     cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
     maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
     However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests will
     have an expected average life of approximately two to four years.

(2)  A portion of this security is on loan at October 31, 2003.

(3)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

Note: At October 31, 2003 the Fund had unfunded commitments amounting to
     $7,106,864 under various credit agreements.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Limited Duration Income Fund (the Fund) is registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified closed-end
   management investment company. The Fund, which was organized as a
   Massachusetts business trust on March 12, 2003, seeks to provide a high level
   of current income. The Fund may, as a secondary objective, also seek capital
   appreciation to the extent consistent with its primary goal of high current
   income. The Fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in,
   mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued, backed or otherwise guaranteed by
   the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; senior, secured
   floating rate loans made to corporate and other business entities (Senior
   Loans); and corporate bonds of below investment grade quality (Non-Investment
   Grade Bonds). The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
   of the Fund. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles
   generally accepted in the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Mortgage backed, pass-through securities are valued
   using an independent matrix pricing system applied by the adviser which takes
   into account closing bond valuations, yield differentials, anticipated
   prepayments and interest rates provided by dealers. Debt securities (other
   than seasoned mortgage backed, pass-through securities) are normally valued
   on the basis of valuations furnished by dealers or a pricing service. Certain
   senior loans are deemed liquid because reliable market quotations are readily
   available for them. Liquid senior loans are valued on the basis of prices
   furnished by a pricing service. Other Senior Loans are valued at fair value
   by the Fund's investment adviser, Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under
   procedures established by the Trustees as permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of
   the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include the consideration
   of relevant factors, data and information relating to fair value, including
   (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data relating to the
   Senior Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate, period until
   next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the Senior Loan,
   the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related agreements, and
   the position of the Senior Loan in the Borrower's debt structure; (ii) the
   nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the Fund's rights,
   remedies and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the
   creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on an evaluation of its financial
   condition, financial statements and information about the Borrower's
   business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv)
   information relating to the market for the Senior Loan including price
   quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan, and interests in similar
   Senior Loans and the market environment and investor attitudes towards the
   Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior Loans; (v) the experience, the
   reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and any
   intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general economic and
   market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Other
   portfolio's securities (other than short-term obligations, but including
   listed issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more
   pricing services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size
   trading units of such securities which may use market information,
   transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between
   securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. In
   certain circumstances, portfolio securities will be valued at the last sales
   price on the exchange that is the primary market for such securities, or the
   last quoted bid price for those securities for which the over-the-counter
   market is the primary market or for listed securities in which there were no
   sales during the day. The value of interest rate swaps will be based on
   dealer quotations. Short-term obligations which mature in 60 days or less,
   are valued at amortized cost, if their original term to maturity when
   acquired by the Fund was 60 days or less or are valued at amortized cost
   using their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if their original term
   to maturity when acquired by the Fund was more than 60 days, unless in each
   case this is determined not to represent fair value. OTC options are valued
   at the mean between the bid and asked price provided by dealers. Financial
   futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges and exchange traded options
   are valued at closing settlement prices. Securities for which there is no
   such quotation or valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined
   in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements
   are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for
   which there are no quotations or valuations are valued at fair value as
   determined in good faith by or on behalf of the Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or accretion of discount. Facility fees received are recognized as
   income over the expected term of the loan. Dividend income is recorded on the
   ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to
                                       21
<Page>

   shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any net realized
   gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise
   tax is necessary.

   D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with the
   offering of the common shares were recorded as a reduction of capital paid in
   excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Fund. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balances the Fund maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used to
   reduce the Fund's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses on
   the Statement of Operations

   G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount
   equal to the premium received by the Fund is included in the Statement of
   Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is
   subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
   written in accordance with the Fund's policies on investment valuations
   discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
   treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are
   exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount
   paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a put
   option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities
   purchased by the Fund. The Fund, as writer of an option, may have no control
   over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or purchased (put)
   and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price
   of the securities underlying the written option.

   H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium
   paid by the Fund is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an
   investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to
   reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with
   the Fund's policies on investment valuations discussed above. If an option
   which the Fund has purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date, the
   Fund will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option. If the Fund
   enters into a closing sale transaction, the Fund will realize a gain or loss,
   depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction are
   greater or less than the cost of the option. If a Fund exercises a put
   option, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying
   security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium
   originally paid. If the Fund exercises a call option, the cost of the
   security which the Fund purchases upon exercise will be increased by the
   premium originally paid.

   I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
   contract, the Fund is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either
   in cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Fund.

   If the Fund enters into a closing transaction, the Fund will realize, for
   book purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
   the financial futures contract to sell and the financial futures contract to
   buy. The Fund's investment in financial futures contracts is designed only to
   hedge against anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should interest
   rates move unexpectedly, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
   the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase
   agreements. Under such an agreement, the Fund temporarily transfers
   possession, but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in return for
   cash. At the same time, the Fund agrees to repurchase the security at an
   agreed-upon price and time in the future. The Fund may enter into reverse
   repurchase agreements for temporary purposes, such as to fund withdrawals, or
   for use as hedging instruments where the underlying security is

                                       22
<Page>

   denominated in a foreign currency. As a form of leverage, reverse repurchase
   agreements may increase the risk of fluctuation in the market value of the
   Fund's assets or in its yield. Liabilities to counterparties under reverse
   repurchase agreements are recognized in the Statement of Assets and
   Liabilities at the same time at which cash is received by the Fund. The
   securities underlying such agreements continue to be treated as owned by the
   Fund and remain in the Portfolio of Investments. Interest charged on amounts
   borrowed by the Fund under reverse repurchase agreements is accrued daily.

   K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements to enhance
   return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities prices or interest rates
   or as substitution for the purchase or sale of securities. Pursuant to these
   agreements, the Fund makes monthly payments at a rate equal to a
   predetermined spread to the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Fund receives
   payments based on the rate of return of a benchmark industry index. During
   during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed delivery
   purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to segregate
   assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal to the
   amount of its purchase commitments.

   L OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   securities are purchased or sold. Realized gains and losses are computed
   based on the specific identification of securities sold.

   M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   N INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating
   to October 31, 2003 and for the period then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Fund's
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   The Fund issued 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A, 7,600
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B, 7,600 shares of Auction
   Preferred Shares Series C, 7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series D,
   7,600 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series E on July 25, 2003 in a
   public offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were
   recorded as a reduction of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the
   APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at
   the offering of the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an
   auction. Dividend rates ranged from 1.07% to 1.30% for Series A Shares, from
   1.07% to 1.30% for Series B Shares, from 1.07% to 1.25% for Series C Shares,
   from 1.07% to 1.25% for Series D Shares and from 1.07% to 1.20% for Series E
   Shares, during the period from the commencement of offering, July 25, 2003,
   to October 31, 2003.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Fund, at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Fund is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
   Fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

                                       23

3  DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the Auction
   Preferred Shares on October 31, 2003 was 1.15%, 1.13%, 1.15%, 1.15% and
   1.10%, for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Shares,
   respectively. For the period from the commencement of offering, July 25,
   2003, to October 31, 2003, the Fund paid dividends to Auction Preferred
   shareholders amounting to $561,769, $564,027, $563,173, $562,810, and
   $556,648 for Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Shares,
   respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such period of
   1.13%, 1.14%, 1.14%, 1.14% and 1.12%, respectively.

   The Fund distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's
   weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management (EVM), as
   compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
   Fund. For the period from the start of business, May 30, 2003, to October 31,
   2003 the fee was equivalent to 0.75% (annualized) of the Fund's average
   weekly gross assets for such period and amounted to $8,563,131.

   In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for
   fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% (annualized) of average weekly
   gross assets of the Fund for the first five years of the Fund's operations.
   For the period from the start of business, May 30, 2003, to October 31, 2003
   the Investment Adviser waived $2,283,502 of its advisory fee.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Fund are officers of the above
   organizations.

5  PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

   Purchases, sales and paydowns of investments, other than short-term
   obligations, aggregated $4,213,105,961 and $1,075,804,536 respectively.

6  SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT

   The Fund has established a securities lending agreement with brokers in which
   the Fund lends portfolio securities to a broker in exchange for collateral
   consisting of either cash or U.S. government securities in an amount at least
   equal to the market value of the securities on loan. Under the agreement, the
   Fund continues to earn interest on the securities loaned. Collateral received
   is generally cash, and the Fund invests the cash and receives any interest on
   the amount invested but it must also pay the broker a loan rebate fee
   computed as a varying percentage of the collateral received. The loan rebate
   fee paid by the Fund offsets a portion of the interest income received and
   amounted to $3,882 for the period from the start of business, May 30, 2003,
   to October 31, 2003. At October 31, 2003, the value of the securities loaned
   and the value of the collateral amounted to $62,057,653 and $63,520,196,
   respectively. In the event of counterparty default, the Fund is subject to
   potential loss if it is delayed or prevented from exercising its right to
   dispose of the collateral. The Fund bears risk in the event that invested
   collateral is not sufficient to meet obligations due on the loans.

7  COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

   The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
   unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
   beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

9  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The Fund regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include written
   options and financial futures contracts, and may involve, to a varying
   degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial
   statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
   represent the investment the Fund has in particular classes of financial
   instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially
   subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these
   instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions
   are considered. At October 31, 2003 there were no outstanding obligations
   under these financial interments.

EATON VANCE LIMITED DURATION INCOME FUND

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
automatically reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Fund. You may
elect to participate in the Plan by completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Application Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying
agent. On the distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is
equal to or less than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage
commissions then new Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be
determined by the greater of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market
price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased on the open market by the
Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or
not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Fund. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquiries regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The registrant's Board has adopted a proxy voting policy and procedure (the
"Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated proxy voting
responsibility to the registrant's investment adviser and adopted the investment
adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which are
described below. The Trustees will review the registrant's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
registrant's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any
of their affiliates or any affiliate of the registrant, the investment adviser
will generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving
rise to such conflict until it consults with the Board's Special Committee
except as contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Special Committee will
instruct the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

<Page>

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the registrant's shareholders and the investment
adviser, the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the
registrant by maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective
corporate clients. The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing
and voting proxies on behalf of the registrant will report any proxy received or
expected to be received from a company included on that list to the investment
adviser's general counsel or chief equity investment officer. The general
counsel or chief equity investment officer will determine if a conflict exists.
If a conflict does exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance
with the Policy or the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote
from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the registrant voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004
will be available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122,
and (2) on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov.
