NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  - SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge   Fund
            Portfolios LLC ("the  Company") was organized as a Delaware  Limited
            Liability  Company on August 16,  2002.  The  Company is  registered
            under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act")  as
            amended,  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
            company.  The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of
            1933 ("1933  Act").  The Company  consists of two  separate  series,
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  (each  a
            "Series").   The  financial   statements  included  herein  are  for
            Multi-Strategy  Series G. The investment objective of Multi-Strategy
            Series G is to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
            investing  in  investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by
            third-party investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ
            a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
            strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage
            or   short-side   positions   to   take   advantage   of   perceived
            inefficiencies  across  the global  markets,  often  referred  to as
            "alternative"   strategies.   Because   Investment  Funds  following
            alternative  investment  strategies  are  often  described  as hedge
            funds,  the  investment  program of  Multi-Strategy  Series G can be
            described as a fund of hedge funds.

            Units of  Multi-Strategy  Series G are  sold to  eligible  investors
            (referred  to as  "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in
            Multi-Strategy Series G from each Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000
            from  January 1, 2003 to November 1, 2003);  the minimum  additional
            investment is $10,000.

            Citigroup Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI" or "the "Adviser"),  a
            Delaware  limited  liability  company  and  indirect,  wholly  owned
            subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            investment  adviser.  The  Adviser is  registered  as an  investment
            adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and,
            among  other  things,   is   responsible   for  the   allocation  of
            Multi-Strategy Series G's assets to various Investment Funds. AMACAR
            Partners, Inc. is the managing member of Multi-Strategy Series G and
            has delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management
            of the operations and assets of Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board
            of Directors.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Investments  in  Investment  Funds are  subject  to the terms of the
            respective limited partnership agreements, limited liability company
            agreements and offering  memoranda.  Multi-Strategy  Series G values
            these  investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by
            the Investment Funds.

            A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The net asset value of  Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of
            the close of  business at the end of each month in  accordance  with
            the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be  determined
            from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the Board of
            Directors.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  investments  in  Investment  Funds  are
            carried at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            pro-rata  interest in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All
            valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
            Fund and are net of management  and  performance  incentive  fees or
            other  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers  as
            required  by  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment
            Manager  to  which  the   Adviser   allocates   assets  will  charge
            Multi-Strategy  Series G, as  investor in an  underlying  Investment
            Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment Managers
            will  receive  performance-based  compensation  in  the  form  of an
            incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers are
            generally expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets
            under their  management and the incentive fee is generally  expected
            to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

            As a general  matter,  the fair value of  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
            investment  in  an  Investment   Fund  represents  the  amount  that
            Multi-Strategy  Series G can  reasonably  expect to receive  from an
            Investment  Fund  if  Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  investment  were
            redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available at
            the time.  The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions
            ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require
            advance notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest, and may,
            depending on the Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or
            delay a redemption request.  Multi-Strategy Series G does not take a
            liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Funds held.  The  underlying
            investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value
            as described in each Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  The
            Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
            securities and other investments that are illiquid.

            B.    FUND EXPENSES

            Multi-Strategy Series G bears all expenses incurred in the course of
            its operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all
            costs and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions
            for Multi-Strategy  Series G's account;  professional fees; costs of
            insurance;  registration  expenses;  and expenses of meetings of the
            Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with the initial
            offering were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of
            operations;  costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy Series
            G's  subsequent  registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred
            and were  amortized  over the  twelve  months  commencing  after the
            effective date of such registration statement.

            C.    INCOME TAXES

            Prior to  October  1, 2005,  Multi-Strategy  Series G operated  as a
            partnership for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will
            be required  to report on his,  her or its own annual tax return the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Effective on October 1, 2005, Multi-Strategy Series G has elected to
            be taxed as a  corporation  and  intends to qualify as a  "regulated
            investment  company"  under the Internal  Revenue Code by making the
            requisite  distributions  to  Members  that  will be  sufficient  to
            relieve  it  from  Federal   income  tax  and  Federal  excise  tax.
            Therefore,  no  Federal  tax  provision  has  been  provided  in the
            accompanying financial statements.

            D.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank,
            N.A.  account that pays money market rates and are  accounted for at
            cost plus accrued interest.

            E.    RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

            Receivable from investment funds of $17,695,271  represents  amounts
            due to  Multi-Strategy  Series G for sales of  interests  in certain
            investment funds.

            F.    USE OF ESTIMATES

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Adviser to
            make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
            the  financial   statements  and  accompanying  notes.  The  Adviser
            believes  that the  estimates  utilized in preparing  Multi-Strategy
            Series G's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however,
            actual results could differ from these estimates.

      3.    MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
            OTHER

            CAI, as Adviser,  provides  certain  management  and  administrative
            services to Multi-Strategy  Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate
            and select Investment Managers, to allocate assets, to establish and
            apply risk management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment
            performance.  In addition,  CAI also provides office space and other
            support services. In consideration for such services, Multi-Strategy
            Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee based on end
            of month Members' capital. The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee
            to its affiliates.

            Effective  August  1,  2005,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  a
            reduction in the management fee to 1.5% of net assets annually (from
            2.25% annually).

            In addition,  CAI allocated  certain  marketing  related expenses of
            $4,005  to  Multi-Strategy  Series G  during  the six  months  ended
            September 30, 2005.

            Placement  agents may be  retained  by the  Company to assist in the
            placement of Units. A placement  agent  affiliated  with the Adviser
            will  generally  be entitled to receive a fee from each  investor in
            the Company whose Units the agent places. The specific amount of the
            placement  fee paid with respect

            to a Member is generally  dependent on the size of the investment in
            a Series.  Placement  agents may also be  reimbursed  by the Company
            with respect to certain out-of-pocket expenses.

            Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
            wholly owned  subsidiary  of Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement
            agent of the Multi-Strategy Series G Units. For the six months ended
            September  30,  2005,  CGM  earned  $56,675  in  placement  fees  on
            Multi-Strategy  Series  G Units.  Such  fees  are  deducted  from an
            investor's gross contribution amount.

            The Company has entered into agreements with third parties to act as
            additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G Units.
            Placement  fees may range from 0 to 3%. In  addition,  the  Adviser,
            and/or its affiliates,  will pay the placement agents an annual fee,
            payable monthly in arrears. The fee shall be paid from the Adviser's
            own resources (or those of its affiliates).

            Multi-Strategy  Series G pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on
            an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon average
            net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,  and will  reimburse
            certain  expenses.  CAI, as  Administrator,  has retained  PFPC Inc.
            ("PFPC"), an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of
            The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
            its administrative duties. PFPC provides certain accounting,  record
            keeping, tax and investor related services.

            Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Company,  as
            defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
            a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $500.  Such  Director
            fees are  allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based on the relative
            net  assets  of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
            person"  does not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.
            All  Directors  are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket
            expenses.   Total   amounts   expensed   related  to   Directors  by
            Multi-Strategy  Series G for the six months ended September 30, 2005
            were $13,165.

            PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as custodian of
            Multi-Strategy Series G's assets and provides custodial services for
            Multi-Strategy   Series  G.  Fees  payable  to  the   custodian  and
            reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series
            G.

      4.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

            The  following  table lists the aggregate  purchases,  proceeds from
            sales  of  Investment  Funds,  net  unrealized  appreciation,  gross
            unrealized  appreciation,  and gross unrealized depreciation for the
            six months ended September 30, 2005. At September 30, 2005, the cost
            of investments for Federal income tax purposes was substantially the
            same as the cost for financial reporting purposes.

      5.    CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

            Generally,  initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units may be
            accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized
            by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  to accept or reject any
            initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units in  Multi-Strategy
            Series  G.  The  Board  of  Directors  from  time to time and in its
            complete  and   exclusive   discretion,   may   determine  to  cause
            Multi-Strategy Series G to repurchase Units from Members pursuant to
            written  tenders by Members on such terms and  conditions  as it may
            determine. CAI expects that it typically will recommend to the Board
            of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Units from Members
            quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31
            (or,  if any such date is not a  business  day,  on the  immediately
            preceding business day).

            Net  profits  or net  losses  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G for each
            month-end will be allocated among and credited to or debited against
            the capital accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month
            in accordance with the Members'  respective  investment  percentages
            for the month.

            Transactions  in units  were as  follows  for the six  months  ended
            September 30, 2005 and the year ended March 31, 2005:

            Portfolios LLC ("the  Company") was organized as a Delaware  Limited
            Liability  Company on August 16,  2002.  The  Company is  registered
            under  the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act")  as
            amended,  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
            company.  The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of
            1933 ("1933  Act").  The Company  consists of two  separate  series,
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  Multi-Strategy  Series  G  (each  a
            "Series").   The  financial   statements  included  herein  are  for
            Multi-Strategy  Series M. The investment objective of Multi-Strategy
            Series M is to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
            investing  in  investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by
            third-party investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ
            a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
            strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage
            or   short-side   positions   to   take   advantage   of   perceived
            inefficiencies  across  the global  markets,  often  referred  to as
            "alternative"   strategies.   Because   Investment  Funds  following
            alternative  investment  strategies  are  often  described  as hedge
            funds,  the  investment  program of  Multi-Strategy  Series M can be
            described as a fund of hedge funds.

            Units of  Multi-Strategy  Series M are  sold to  eligible  investors
            (referred  to as  "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in
            Multi-Strategy Series M from each Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000
            from  January 1, 2003 to November 1, 2003);  the minimum  additional
            investment is $10,000.

            Citigroup Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI", or the "Adviser"),  a
            Delaware  limited  liability  company  and  indirect,  wholly  owned
            subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
            investment  adviser.  The  Adviser is  registered  as an  investment
            adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and,
            among  other  things,   is   responsible   for  the   allocation  of
            Multi-Strategy Series M's assets to various Investment Funds. AMACAR
            Partners, Inc. is the managing member of Multi-Strategy Series M and
            has delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management
            of the operations and assets of Multi-Strategy Series M to the Board
            of Directors.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Investments  in  Investment  Funds are  subject  to the terms of the
            respective limited partnership agreements, limited liability company
            agreements and offering  memoranda.  Multi-Strategy  Series M values
            these  investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by
            the Investment Funds.

            A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The net asset value of  Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of
            the close of  business at the end of each month in  accordance  with
            the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be  determined
            from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the Board of
            Directors.

            Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  investments  in  Investment  Funds  are
            carried at fair value as determined

            by Multi-Strategy  Series M's pro-rata interest in the net assets of
            each Investment Fund. All valuations  utilize financial  information
            supplied  by each  Investment  Fund  and are net of  management  and
            performance  incentive  fees or  other  allocations  payable  to the
            Investment  Funds'  managers as required  by the  Investment  Funds'
            agreements.  Each Investment  Manager to which the Adviser allocates
            assets  will  charge  Multi-Strategy  Series  M, as  investor  in an
            underlying  Investment  Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of
            the Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation
            in the  form  of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the
            Investment  Managers are  generally  expected to range from 1% to 3%
            annually of the net assets under their  management and the incentive
            fee is  generally  expected  to range from 15% to 25% of net profits
            annually.

            As a general  matter,  the fair value of  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
            investment  in  an  Investment   Fund  represents  the  amount  that
            Multi-Strategy  Series M can  reasonably  expect to receive  from an
            Investment  Fund  if  Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  investment  were
            redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available at
            the time.  The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions
            ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds generally require
            advance notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest, and may,
            depending on the Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or
            delay a redemption request.  Multi-Strategy Series M does not take a
            liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Funds held.  The  underlying
            investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value
            as described in each Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.  The
            Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
            securities and other investments that are illiquid.

            B.    FUND EXPENSES

            Multi-Strategy Series M bears all expenses incurred in the course of
            its operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all
            costs and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions
            for Multi-Strategy  Series M's account;  professional fees; costs of
            insurance;  registration  expenses;  and expenses of meetings of the
            Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with the initial
            offering were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of
            operations;  costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy Series
            M's  subsequent  registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred
            and were  amortized  over the  twelve  months  commencing  after the
            effective date of such registration statement.

            C.    INCOME TAXES

            Prior to  October  1, 2005,  Multi-Strategy  Series M operated  as a
            partnership for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will
            be required  to report on his,  her or its own annual tax return the
            Member's  distributive  share of  Multi-Strategy  Series M's taxable
            income or loss.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Effective on October 1, 2005, Multi-Strategy Series M has elected to
            be taxed as a  corporation  and  intends to qualify as a  "regulated
            investment  company"  under the Internal  Revenue Code by making the
            requisite  distributions  to  Members  that  will be  sufficient  to
            relieve  it  from  Federal   income  tax  and  Federal  excise  tax.
            Therefore,  no  Federal  tax  provision  has  been  provided  in the
            accompanying financial statements.

            D.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank,
            N.A.  account which pays money market rates and are accounted for at
            cost plus accrued interest.

            E.    RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

            Receivable from investment funds of $11,560,179  represents  amounts
            due to  Multi-Strategy  Series M for sales of  interests  in certain
            investment funds.

            F.    USE OF ESTIMATES

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Adviser to
            make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
            the  financial   statements  and  accompanying  notes.  The  Adviser
            believes  that the  estimates  utilized in preparing  Multi-Strategy
            Series M's financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however,
            actual results could differ from these estimates.

      3.    MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
            OTHER

            CAI, as Adviser,  provides  certain  management  and  administrative
            services to Multi-Strategy  Series M. CAI acts primarily to evaluate
            and select Investment Managers, to allocate assets, to establish and
            apply risk management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment
            performance.  In addition,  CAI also provides office space and other
            support services. In consideration for such services, Multi-Strategy
            Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee based on end
            of month Members' capital. The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee
            to its affiliates.

            Effective  August  1,  2005,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  a
            reduction in the management fee to 1.5% of net assets annually (from
            2.00% annually).

            In addition,  CAI allocated  certain  marketing  related expenses of
            $1,522  to  Multi-Strategy  Series M  during  the six  months  ended
            September 30, 2005.

            Placement  agents may be  retained  by the  Company to assist in the
            placement of Units. A placement  agent  affiliated  with the Adviser
            will  generally  be entitled to receive a fee from each  investor in
            the Company whose Units the Agent places. The specific amount of the
            placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent
            on the size of the investment in a Series. Placement agents may also
            be reimbursed  by the Company with respect to certain  out-of-pocket
            expenses.

            Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
            wholly owned  subsidiary  of Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement
            agent of the Multi-Strategy Series M Units. For the six month period
            ended  September 30, 2005,  CGM earned  $21,400 in placement fees on
            Multi-Strategy  Series  M Units.  Such  fees  are  deducted  from an
            investor's gross contribution amount.

            The Company has entered into agreements with third parties to act as
            additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M Units.
            Placement  fees may range from 0 to 3%. In  addition,  the  Adviser,
            and/or its affiliates,  will pay the placement agents an annual fee,
            payable monthly in arrears. The fee shall be paid from the Adviser's
            own resources (or those of its affiliates).

            Multi-Strategy  Series M pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on
            an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon average
            net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,  and will  reimburse
            certain  expenses.  CAI, as  Administrator,  has retained  PFPC Inc.
            ("PFPC"), an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of
            The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
            its administrative duties. PFPC provides certain accounting,  record
            keeping, tax and investor related services.

            Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Company,  as
            defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
            a fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $500.  Such  Director
            fees are  allocated to each series  pro-rata,  based on the relative
            net  assets  of each  series.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
            person"  does not receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.
            All  Directors  are  reimbursed  for all  reasonable  out of  pocket
            expenses.   Total   amounts   expensed   related  to   Directors  by
            Multi-Strategy  Series M for the six months ended September 30, 2005
            were $4,884.

            PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as custodian of
            Multi-Strategy Series M's assets and provides custodial services for
            Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees  payable  to  the   custodian  and
            reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series
            M.

            same as the cost for financial reporting purposes.

            Cost of purchases                        $ 44,718,017

            Generally,  initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units may be
            accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized
            by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  to accept or reject any
            initial and  additional  subscriptions  for Units in  Multi-Strategy
            Series  M.  The  Board  of  Directors  from  time to time and in its
            complete   and   exclusive   discretion   may   determine  to  cause
            Multi-Strategy Series M to repurchase Units from Members pursuant to
            written  tenders by Members on such terms and  conditions  as it may
            determine. CAI expects that it typically will recommend to the Board
            of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Units from Members
            quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31
            (or,  if any such date is not a  business  day,  on the  immediately
            preceding business day).

            Net  profits  or net  losses  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M for each

            the capital accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month
            in accordance with the Members'  respective  investment  percentages
            for the month.

        of the filing date of the report that includes the  disclosure  required
        by this  paragraph,  based on their  evaluation  of these  controls  and
        procedures  required  by  Rule  30a-3(b)  under  the  1940  Act  (17 CFR
        270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b)  or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
        Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as   amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
        240.15d-15(b)).


    (b) There  were  no  changes  in  the  registrant's  internal  control  over
        financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
        CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
        quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that  has  materially
        affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
