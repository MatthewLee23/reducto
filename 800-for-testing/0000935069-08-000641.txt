ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The Report to Shareholders is attached herewith.


                                                                   [LOGO]

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2007

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers  to  certify  the  entire   contents  of  the  semi-annual  and  annual
shareholder  reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification  would cover the portfolio  manager's  commentary
and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached  to or a part of the  financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

      Because we do not want our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or  restrict their  commentary to historical  facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial  statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to  you  separately.  Both  the  commentary  and  the  financial  statements,
including  the  portfolio  of  investments,  will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com.

      Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2007.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The Gabelli  Utility Trust (the "Fund") is a  non-diversified
closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware statutory trust
on February 25, 1999 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"). Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

      The Fund's  primary  objective is long-term  growth of capital and income.
The Fund will invest 80% of its  assets,  under  normal  market  conditions,  in
common stocks and other securities of foreign and domestic companies involved in
providing   products,   services,   or  equipment  for  (i)  the  generation  or
distribution of electricity, gas, and water and (ii) telecommunications services
or infrastructure  operations (the "80% Policy").  The 80% Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval.  However, the Fund has adopted a policy to provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good  faith to reflect  its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities will be fair valued as determined by

the Board.  Debt  instruments  having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which
market  quotations are readily available are valued at the average of the latest
bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on such day,  the
security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at
the  closing  settlement  price of the  exchange  or board of trade on which the
applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  fair  valued  as  determined  by  the  Board.   Fair   valuation
methodologies  and procedures may include,  but are not limited to: analysis and
review of available  financial and non-financial  information about the company;
comparisons  to the  valuation  and changes in valuation of similar  securities,
including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value
ADR  securities at the close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other
information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      In September 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  157, Fair Value
Measurements,  which  clarifies  the  definition  of  fair  value  and  requires
companies  to expand  their  disclosure  about the use of fair  value to measure
assets and  liabilities  in interim  and annual  periods  subsequent  to initial
recognition.  Adoption of SFAS 157  requires  the use of the price that would be
received  to sell  an  asset  or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an  orderly
transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date. SFAS 157 is
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
November 15, 2007, and interim  periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is in the process of reviewing the  requirements  of SFAS 157 against
its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.

      REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At December
31, 2007, there were no open repurchase agreements.

      SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into equity swap and  interest  rate
swap or cap  transactions.  The use of swaps  and  caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary portfolio transactions. Swap agreements may involve, to
varying degrees,  elements of market and counterparty risk, and exposure to loss
in excess of the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party  to the  interest  rate  swap  (which  is  known  as  the  "counterparty")
periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the  Fund's  variable  rate  payment  obligation  on the  Series  B
Preferred  Shares.  In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the
counterparty  and, to the extent that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a
predetermined  fixed rate, would receive from the  counterparty  payments of the
difference based on the notional amount of such cap. In an equity swap, a set of
future cash flows are exchanged  between two  counterparties.  One of these cash
flow streams will typically be based on a reference  interest rate combined with
the  performance  of a  notional  value of shares of a stock.  The other will be
based on the  performance  of the shares of a stock.  Swap and cap  transactions
introduce  additional  risk  because  the Fund  would  remain  obligated  to pay
preferred  stock  dividends  when  due  in  accordance  with  the  Statement  of
Preferences  even if the  counterparty  defaulted.  If there is a default by the
counterparty  to a swap  contract,  the  Fund  will be  limited  to  contractual
remedies  pursuant to the  agreements  related to the  transaction.  There is no
assurance  that  the swap  contract  counterparties  will be able to meet  their
obligations pursuant to the swap contracts or that, in the event of default, the
Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from  obtaining  payments owed to it
pursuant  to the swap  contracts.  The  creditworthiness  of the  swap  contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio  securities  at that point in time,  such a default  could  negatively
affect the Fund's ability to make dividend payments. In addition, at the time an
interest rate swap or cap transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,
there  is a risk  that  the  Fund  will  not be able  to  obtain  a  replacement
transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not be as favorable as on
the expiring transaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the
Fund's ability to make dividend payments.

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The change in the value of swaps,  including the accrual of periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps,

      The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with Citibank

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Fund may  engage  in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase.  Upon entering into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/depreciation   on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The  Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At December 31, 2007,  there were no
open futures contracts.

      FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in unrealized  appreciation  (depreciation)  on investments and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At December  31,  2007,  there were no open  forward
foreign exchange contracts.

      FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated  at the exchange  rate  prevailing  on the  respective  dates of such
transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from  changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been included
in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign  currency
translations.  Net realized  foreign  currency  gains and losses  resulting from
changes in exchange  rates include  foreign  currency  gains and losses  between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain (loss) on investments.

      FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

      FOREIGN TAXES.  The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income,  gains
on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

      CUSTODIAN  FEE  CREDITS  AND  INTEREST  EXPENSE.  When cash  balances  are
maintained in the custody  account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits." When cash balances are
overdrawn,  the Fund is  charged  an  overdraft  fee equal to 110% of the 90 day
Treasury Bill rate. This amount, if any, would be shown as "interest expense" in
the Statement of Operations.

      DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing  characterizations  of distributions  made by the Fund.  Distributions
from net  investment  income  include  net  realized  gains on foreign  currency
transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either  temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these  differences are permanent,  adjustments are made to
the  appropriate  capital  accounts  in the period when the  differences  arise.
Permanent differences for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily
attributable to reclassifications for swap gains and capital gain dividends from
underlying funds. These reclassifications have no impact on the NAV of the Fund.
For the fiscal year ended  December  31,  2007,  reclassifications  were made to
decrease  accumulated  distributions  in  excess  of net  investment  income  by
$340,290  and to increase  accumulated  distributions  in excess of net realized
gain on  investments,  swap  contracts,  and foreign  currency  transactions  by
$340,290.

      Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred  Shares  and  Series B  Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares
("Cumulative Preferred Shares") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined
as described in Note 5.

      The tax  character  of  distributions  paid during the fiscal  years ended
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was as follows:

      PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

      At December  31,  2007,  the  difference  between book basis and tax basis
unrealized  appreciation  (depreciation) was primarily due to deferral of losses
from wash sales for tax purposes,  mark-to-market adjustments on passive foreign
investment  companies,  and basis  adjustments  due to income accruals on hybrid
securities.

      At December 31, 2007, the components of accumulated earnings (losses) on a
tax basis were as follows:

      FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes,  an  Interpretation  of FASB  Statement  No. 109" (the  "Interpretation")
established  a minimum  threshold  for financial  statement  recognition  of the
benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns  (including whether the Fund is
taxable  in  a  particular  jurisdiction)  and  required  certain  expanded  tax
disclosures.  The Fund has adopted the Interpretation for all open tax years and
it had no impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of its average  weekly
net assets including the liquidation value of the preferred stock. In accordance
with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous  investment
program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of all aspects
of the  Fund's  business  and  affairs.  The  Adviser  has  agreed to reduce the
management  fee  on  the  incremental  assets  attributable  to  the  Cumulative
Preferred  Shares if the total  return  of the NAV of the  common  shares of the
Fund,  including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not
exceed the stated  dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of the  Cumulative
Preferred Shares for the fiscal year.

      The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred Shares for the period. For the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007,  the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common  shares did
exceed the stated  dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of all outstanding
preferred shares. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

      During the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2007,  the Fund paid  brokerage
commissions  of $62,379 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli &  Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

      The  cost of  calculating  the  Fund's  NAV per  share  is a Fund  expense
pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser.  During the
fiscal year ended  December  31, 2007,  the Fund paid or accrued  $45,000 to the
Adviser in connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

      As per the  approval of the Board,  the Fund  compensates  officers of the
Fund, who are employed by the Fund and are not employed by the Adviser (although
the officers may receive  incentive based variable  compensation from affiliates
of the Adviser) and pays its  allocated  portion of the cost of the Fund's Chief
Compliance  Officer.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund paid
or accrued  $281,841,  which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

      The Fund pays  each  Trustee  who is not  considered  to be an  affiliated
person an annual  retainer of $6,000 plus $500 for each Board  meeting  attended
and they are  reimbursed  for any out of pocket  expenses  incurred in attending
meetings.  All Board  committee  members receive $500 per meeting  attended.  In
addition,  the Audit Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $3,000 and the
Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000. Trustees who are
directors  or  employees  of the  Adviser or an  affiliated  company  receive no
compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the year ended  December 31, 2007,  other than  short-term  and U.S.  Government

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

      The Fund is authorized to issue up to 2,005,000 shares of $0.001 par value
Cumulative  Preferred Shares. The Cumulative  Preferred Shares are senior to the
common shares and result in the financial  leveraging of the common shares. Such
leveraging  tends  to  magnify  both  the  risks  and  opportunities  to  common
shareholders.  Dividends  on  shares  of the  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares  are
cumulative.  The  Fund is  required  by the  1940  Act and by the  Statement  of
Preferences  to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the Cumulative
Preferred  Shares.  If the Fund  fails to meet these  requirements  and does not
correct such  failure,  the Fund may be required to redeem,  in part or in full,
the 5.625% Series A and Series B Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares at a
redemption price of $25.00 and $25,000,  respectively,  per share plus an amount
equal to the  accumulated and unpaid  dividends  whether or not declared on such
shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to meet the
foregoing asset coverage  requirements  could restrict the Fund's ability to pay
dividends to common shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities
at  inopportune  times.  The income  received on the Fund's assets may vary in a
manner  unrelated  to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
common shareholders.

      On July 31, 2003,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $28,895,026  (after
underwriting  discounts of $945,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public  offering of 1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Shares.  Commencing July 31, 2008 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option,  may
redeem the 5.625%  Series A Cumulative  Preferred  Shares in whole or in part at
the  redemption  price at any time.  During the fiscal year ended  December  31,
2007, the Fund  repurchased  500 shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative  Preferred
Shares in the open  market  at a cost of  $11,710  and an  average  discount  of
approximately  6.40%  from  its  liquidation  value of  $25.00  per  share.  All
repurchased  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares have been
retired.  At December 31, 2007,  1,183,700  shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Shares were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $27,743.

      On July 31, 2003,  the Fund  received net proceeds of  $24,590,026  (after
underwriting  discounts of $250,000 and offering  expenses of $159,974) from the
public offering of 1,000 shares of Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred
Shares.  The dividend  rate, as set by the auction  process,  which is generally
held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates.  The
dividend rates of Series B Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares ranged
from 4.427% to 6.200% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. If the number
of Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Shares subject to bid orders by
potential  holders is less than the number of Series B Auction Market Cumulative
Preferred Shares subject to sell orders,  then the auction is considered to be a
failed  auction,  and the dividend rate will be the maximum rate. In that event,
holders  that have  submitted  sell orders may not be able to sell any or all of
the  Series B Auction  Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares for which they have
submitted  sell  orders.  The  current  maximum  rate is 125% of the  seven  day
Telerate/British Bankers Association LIBOR on the day of such auction.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit an order to hold,  bid,  or sell  such  shares on each
auction date. Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Shares  shareholders
may also trade shares in the  secondary  market.  The Fund,  at its option,  may
redeem the Series B Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Shares in whole or in
part at the redemption price at any time.  During the fiscal year ended December
31,  2007,  the Fund did not  redeem  any  shares  of  Series B  Auction  Market
Cumulative  Preferred  Shares.  At December 31,  2007,  1,000 shares of Series B
Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred Shares were outstanding with an annualized
dividend rate of 5.75% per share and accrued dividends amounted to $23,958.

      The holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Shares generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class.  The
holders of Cumulative  Preferred  Shares voting  together as a single class also
have the right  currently to elect two Trustees and under certain  circumstances
are  entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Trustees.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding  shares of the preferred shares,  voting as a single class, will
be  required  to approve  any plan of  reorganization  adversely  affecting  the
preferred  shares,  and  the  approval  of  two-thirds  of  each  class,  voting
separately,  of the Fund's  outstanding voting stock must approve the conversion
of the Fund from a closed-end to an open-end investment company. The approval of
a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding  preferred shares and
a  majority  (as  defined  in the 1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting
securities are required to approve certain other actions,  including  changes in
the Fund's investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6. INDUSTRY  CONCENTRATION.  Because the Fund primarily invests in common stocks
and other securities of foreign and domestic  companies in the utility industry,
its  portfolio  may be subject to greater  risk and market  fluctuations  than a
portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. OTHER MATTERS.  The Adviser  and/or  affiliates  received  subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund share  trading  practices  involving  certain  funds  managed by the
Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,   Inc.  ("GAMCO"),  the  Adviser's  parent  company,
responded to these  requests for documents and  testimony.  In June 2006,  GAMCO
began discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry.
In February  2007,  the Adviser made an offer of  settlement to the staff of the
SEC for  communication  to the Commission for its  consideration to resolve this
matter.  This offer of settlement is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents.  On a
separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the
SEC that the staff may recommend to the Commission that an administrative remedy
and a monetary penalty be sought from the Adviser in connection with the actions
of two of nine closed-end funds managed by the Adviser relating to Section 19(a)
and Rule 19a-1 of the 1940 Act. These provisions require  registered  investment
companies to provide written  statements to shareholders when a dividend is made
from a source other than net investment  income.  While the two closed-end funds
sent annual statements and provided other materials containing this information,
the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with each distribution
in 2002  and  2003.  The  Adviser  believes  that  all of the  funds  are now in
compliance.  The Adviser believes that these matters would have no effect on the
Fund or any material  adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the
Fund.

++    Based on market value per share, adjusted for reinvestment of
      distributions at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment
      plan, including the effect of shares issued pursuant to rights 2004 and
      2003 rights offerings, assuming full subscription by shareholder.

(a)   Calculated based upon average common shares outstanding on the record
      dates throughout the period.

(b)   The ratios do not include a reduction of expenses for custodian fee
      credits on cash balances maintained with the custodian. Including such
      custodian fee credits for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the
      ratios of operating expenses to average net assets attributable to common
      stock net of advisory fee reduction would have been 1.63% and the ratios
      of operating expenses to average net assets including liquidation value of
      preferred shares net of advisory fee reduction would have been 1.33%.
      Custodian fee credits for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 through
      2006 were minimal.

(c)   The Fund incurred interest expense during the fiscal year ended December
      31, 2007. If interest expense had not been incurred, the ratios of
      operating expenses to average net assets attributable to common shares
      would have been 1.62% and the ratios of operating expenses to average net
      assets including liquidation value of preferred shares would have been
      1.33%.

(d)   Based on weekly prices.

(e)   Asset coverage is calculated by combining all series of preferred shares.

(f)   Amount represents less than $0.005 per share.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Utility Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net assets  and the  financial  highlights  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust
(hereafter  referred to as the "Trust") at December 31, 2007, the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial  highlights for each of
the  five  years  in the  period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial
statements  and  financial  highlights  (hereafter  referred  to  as  "financial
statements")   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Trust's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial  statements in accordance
with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United
States).  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits,  which  included  confirmation  of  securities  at December  31, 2007 by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provide a reasonable  basis for
our opinion.

AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

      Auction Market  Preferred  Shares pay dividends weekly based on a rate set
at auction,  usually held every seven days. The percentage of 2007 distributions
derived from long-term capital gains for the Auction Market Preferred Shares was
59.87%.

      A Form  1099-DIV  has been  mailed to all  shareholders  of record for the
distributions  mentioned above, setting forth specific amounts to be included in
the 2007 tax  returns.  Ordinary  income  distributions  include net  investment
income and realized net short-term capital gains. Ordinary income is reported in
box 1a of Form 1099-DIV.  Capital gain  distributions  are reported in box 2a of
Form  1099-DIV.  The  long-term  gain  distributions  for the fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2007 were $10,389,308, or the maximum allowable.

CORPORATE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION, QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME, AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

      The  Fund  paid to  common  and  5.625%  Series A  preferred  shareholders
ordinary  income  dividends of $0.1944 and $0.5643 per share,  respectively,  in
2007.  The Fund  paid to  Series B  Auction  Market  preferred  shareholders  an
ordinary  income dividend  totaling  $537.8998 per share in 2007. For the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2007, 100% of the ordinary income dividend qualified for
the  dividend  received  deduction  available to  corporations,  and 100% of the
ordinary  income   distribution  was  deemed  qualified   dividend  income.  The
percentage of the ordinary income dividends paid by the Fund during 2007 derived
from U.S. Government  Securities was 0.38%. Such income is exempt from state and
local  tax  in  all  states.  However,  many  states,  including  New  York  and
California,  allow a tax  exemption for a portion of the income earned only if a
mutual fund has  invested at least 50% of its assets at the end of each  quarter
of the Fund's fiscal year in U.S. Government  Securities.  The Fund did not meet
this strict requirement in 2007. The percentage of net assets of U.S. Government
Securities held as of December 31, 2007 was 11.25%.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli   Utility   Trust  (the  "Fund")  to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to credit common  shares to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a capital
gains distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading at a discount or
a premium to net asset value. All distributions to shareholders whose shares are
registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested  pursuant to the
Plan in additional  shares of the Fund. Plan  participants  may send their share
certificates to Computershare Trust Company,  N.A.  ("Computershare") to be held
in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.  Registered  shareholders  wishing to
receive their distributions in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                            The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

      If your shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  reregistered  in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of common shares  distributed  to  participants  in the Plan in
lieu of cash  dividends is determined in the following  manner.  Under the Plan,
whenever the market price of the Fund's common shares is equal to or exceeds net
asset value at the time shares are valued for purposes of determining the number
of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends  or  capital  gains  distribution,
participants are issued common shares valued at the greater of (i) the net asset
value as most recently  determined or (ii) 95% of the then current  market price
of the Fund's common shares.  The valuation date is the dividend or distribution
payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE") trading
day, the next  trading  day. If the net asset value of the common  shares at the
time of valuation  exceeds the market price of the common  shares,  participants
will receive  common  shares from the Fund valued at market  price.  If the Fund
should  declare a dividend or capital gains  distribution  payable only in cash,
Computershare  will buy  common  shares  in the open  market,  or on the NYSE or
elsewhere,  for the  participants'  accounts,  except  that  Computershare  will
endeavor to  terminate  purchases in the open market and cause the Fund to issue
shares at net asset value if, following the commencement of such purchases,  the
market value of the common shares exceeds the then current net asset value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase their  investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's common
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

      SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your request your name,  address,  and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      For more information  regarding the Automatic  Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
and  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are available by calling (914)
921-5070 or by writing directly to the Fund.

      The Fund  reserves the right to amend or terminate  the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days written
notice to participants in the Plan.

         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  registrant  for  each  of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the
         registrant was $0 for 2006 and $0 for 2007.

     (h) The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has

         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt  written  policies and  procedures  governing  the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset  Management Inc.,  Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities,  Inc., and Teton Advisors,  Inc.  (collectively,
the  "Advisers")  to  determine  how  to  vote  proxies  relating  to  portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict  between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the  Advisers;  the  principal  underwriter;  or any  affiliated  person  of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the  Advisers do not have  voting  discretion  or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific  guidelines  or  procedures  supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

         The Proxy Voting Committee was originally  formed in April 1989 for the
purpose of formulating  guidelines  and reviewing  proxy  statements  within the
parameters set by the substantive proxy voting guidelines  originally  published
in 1988 and updated periodically, a copy of which are appended as Exhibit A. The
Committee will include representatives of Research,  Administration,  Legal, and
the  Advisers.  Additional  or  replacement  members  of the  Committee  will be
nominated by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire Committee.

         Meetings  are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in which
the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general,  the  Director of Proxy  Voting  Services,  using the Proxy
Guidelines,  recommendations of Institutional  Shareholder  Corporate Governance
Service  ("ISS"),  other  third-party  services  and the  analysts  of Gabelli &
Company,  Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For  non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the  recommendations  of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial  issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines;  or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of  Directors  but is  consistent  with  the  Proxy  Guidelines.  In those
instances,  the  Director  of  Proxy  Voting  Services  or the  Chairman  of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy  statement  indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters  identified by the Chairman of the Committee,  the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as  controversial,  taking into
account  the  recommendations  of ISS or  other  third  party  services  and the
analysts  of Gabelli & Company,  Inc.,  will be  presented  to the Proxy  Voting
Committee.  If the  Chairman of the  Committee,  the  Director  of Proxy  Voting
Services or the Legal  Department  has  identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial;   (2)  would  benefit  from  deliberation  by  the  Proxy  Voting
Committee;  or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest  between the Advisers
and their clients,  the Chairman of the Committee will initially  determine what
vote to recommend  that the  Advisers  should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         A.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

                  The Advisers have implemented these proxy voting procedures in
                  order to prevent  conflicts of interest from influencing their
                  proxy voting decisions. By following the Proxy Guidelines,  as
                  well as the recommendations of ISS, other third-party services
                  and the  analysts of Gabelli & Company,  the Advisers are able
                  to  avoid,  wherever  possible,  the  influence  of  potential
                  conflicts of interest.  Nevertheless,  circumstances may arise
                  in which one or more of the Advisers are faced with a conflict
                  of  interest  or the  appearance  of a conflict of interest in
                  connection  with its vote. In general,  a conflict of interest
                  may arise  when an Adviser  knowingly  does  business  with an
                  issuer, and may appear to have a material conflict between its
                  own  interests  and the  interests of the  shareholders  of an
                  investment  company  managed by one of the Advisers  regarding
                  how the proxy is to be voted.  A conflict  also may exist when
                  an  Adviser  has  actual  knowledge  of  a  material  business
                  arrangement between an issuer and an affiliate of the Adviser.

                  In  practical  terms,  a conflict of interest  may arise,  for
                  example,  when a proxy is voted for a company that is a client
                  of one of the Advisers,  such as GAMCO Asset Management Inc. A
                  conflict  also may arise when a client of one of the  Advisers
                  has made a shareholder proposal in a proxy to be voted upon by
                  one or more of the  Advisers.  The  Director  of Proxy  Voting
                  Services,  together with the Legal Department, will scrutinize
                  all proxies for these or other  situations  that may give rise
                  to a  conflict  of  interest  with  respect  to the  voting of
                  proxies.

         B.       OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

                  For matters  submitted  to the  Committee,  each member of the
                  Committee  will receive,  prior to the meeting,  a copy of the
                  proxy statement,  any relevant third party research, a summary
                  of any views provided by the Chief Investment  Officer and any
                  recommendations by Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts. The Chief
                  Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may
                  be invited to present  their  viewpoints.  If the  Director of
                  Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department believe that the
                  matter  before the  committee  is one with  respect to which a
                  conflict of interest may exist  between the Advisers and their
                  clients,  counsel  will  provide an  opinion to the  Committee
                  concerning  the  conflict.  If the  matter is one in which the
                  interests  of the  clients  of one or  more  of  Advisers  may
                  diverge,  counsel  will so advise and the  Committee  may make
                  different  recommendations  as to different  clients.  For any
                  matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
                  counsel  will provide an opinion  concerning  the likely risks
                  and merits of such an appraisal action.

         Each matter  submitted to the Committee  will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting.  Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee,  the Chairman of
the Committee  will cast the deciding  vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy  Guidelines  express the normal  preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment  guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee  meetings will be maintained.  The Advisers  subscribe to
ISS, which supplies  current  information on companies,  matters being voted on,
regulations,  trends in proxy voting and  information  on  corporate  governance
issues.

         If  the  vote  cast  either  by  the  analyst  or as a  result  of  the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the  recommendation
of the Board of  Directors  of the issuer,  the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine  whether an amendment to the most recently  filed  Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies,  they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department.  This is the responsibility of the investment  professional or
sales  assistant  for  the  client.  In  accordance  with  Department  of  Labor
guidelines,  the Advisers'  policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan  participants  with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote  shares  held on  behalf  of the  client  in a manner  consistent  with any
individual  investment/voting  guidelines provided by the client.  Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client  chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any  change  in voting  authority,  the  following  should  be  notified  by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

         In the event that the Board of  Directors  (or a Committee  thereof) of
one or more of the  investment  companies  managed  by one of the  Advisers  has
retained  direct voting control over any security,  the Proxy Voting  Department
will provide each Board  Member (or  Committee  member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting  Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients.  The Advisers will supply  information on how
an account voted its proxies upon request.

         A letter  is sent to the  custodians  for all  clients  for  which  the
Advisers  have  voting  responsibility  instructing  them to  forward  all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The  sales  assistant  sends  the  letters  to the  custodians  along  with  the
trading/DTC  instructions.  Proxy voting  records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1. Custodian banks,  outside  brokerage firms and clearing firms are responsible
for forwarding proxies directly to the Advisers.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder  Vote  Authorization  Forms  ("VAFs")  - Issued  by  Broadridge
     Financial  Solutions,  Inc.  ("Broadridge")  VAFs must be voted through the
     issuing  institution  causing a time lag.  Broadridge is an outside service
     contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon  receipt of the  proxy,  the number of shares  each form  represents  is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In  the case of a  discrepancy  such as an  incorrect  number of  shares,  an
improperly  signed or dated card,  wrong class of  security,  etc.,  the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are  made to  insure  that a  proper  proxy  is  received  in  time to be  voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

4. Upon receipt of instructions  from the proxy committee (see  Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Records have been  maintained on the Proxy Edge system.  The system is backed up
regularly.

Proxy Edge records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue

5. VAFs are kept  alphabetically  by  security.  Records for the  current  proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming  season,  files are transferred to an offsite  storage  facility during
January/February.

6.  Shareholder  Vote  Authorization  Forms issued by Broadridge are always sent
directly to a specific individual at Broadridge.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received  too late to be voted in the  conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o  VAFs can be faxed to  Broadridge  up until  the time of the  meeting. This is
   followed up by mailing the original form.

o  When  a  solicitor  has  been  retained,  the  solicitor  is  called.  At the
   solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy  contest,  records are  maintained  for each  opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be  necessary  to vote the shares in person.  In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o  Banks and brokerage firms using the services at Broadridge:

      The back of the VAF is stamped  indicating that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent overnight to Broadridge.  Broadridge  issues  individual
legal  proxies  and  sends  them  back via  overnight  (or the  Adviser  can pay
messenger  charges).  A lead-time  of at least two weeks prior to the meeting is
needed to do this.  Alternatively,  the procedures  detailed below for banks not
using Broadridge may be implemented.

o  Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

   The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal  proxies are given to the person  attending  the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o  A  limited   Power  of   Attorney   appointing   the   attendee   an  Adviser
   representative.

o  A list of all shares being voted by custodian only.  Client names and account
   numbers  are not  included.  This  list  must be  presented,  along  with the
   proxies,  to the Inspectors of Elections  and/or  tabulator at least one-half
   hour  prior  to the  scheduled  start  of the  meeting.  The  tabulator  must
   "qualify" the votes (i.e. determine if the vote have previously been cast, if
   the votes have been rescinded, etc. vote have previously been cast, etc.).

o  A sample ERISA and Individual contract.

o  A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o  A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).






                                   APPENDIX A
                                PROXY GUIDELINES




PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our  clients.  As we  state  in  our  Magna  Carta  of  Shareholders  Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST  management.  We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy  committee  meeting in 1989,  it was decided  that each proxy
statement  should be  evaluated  on its own merits  within the  framework  first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders  Rights. The attached  guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not  consider any issue  routine.  We take into  consideration  all of our
research on the company, its directors,  and their short and long-term goals for
the  company.  In cases  where  issues that we  generally  do not approve of are
combined with other issues,  the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall  proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.



BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The  advisers do not  consider  the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Historical responsiveness to shareholders
            This may include such areas as:
            -Paying greenmail
            -Failure to adopt shareholder  resolutions  receiving  a majority of
             shareholder votes
o        Qualifications
o        Nominating committee in place
o        Number of outside directors on the board
o        Attendance at meetings
o        Overall performance



SELECTION OF AUDITORS

In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for auditors.



BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check  preferred  stock  allows the  company to issue stock and  establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.



CLASSIFIED BOARD

A  classified  board is one where the  directors  are divided  into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified  board  promotes  continuity of directors  facilitating  long
range  planning,  we feel directors  should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case  basis taking into
consideration   the  board's   historical   responsiveness   to  the  rights  of
shareholders.

Where a classified  board is in place we will generally not support  attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an  annually  elected  board is in place,  we  generally  will not  support
attempts to classify the board.



INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

The request to increase  the amount of  outstanding  shares is  considered  on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o        Future use of additional shares
            -Stock split
            -Stock option or other executive  compensation  plan
            -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet
            -Aid in restructuring
            -Improve credit rating
            -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o        Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
         stock option plans
o        Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and  verifiable  plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.



CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT

We support  the idea that a  shareholder's  identity  and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.



CUMULATIVE VOTING

In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total  number  for one  candidate  or  allocate  the  voting  among  two or more
candidates.

Where  cumulative  voting is in place,  we will vote  against  any  proposal  to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board.  When a  proposal  is made to  institute  cumulative  voting,  the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all  shareholders,  cumulative  voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.



DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

We support  efforts to attract  the best  possible  directors  by  limiting  the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.



EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY

The SEC's rules provide for shareholder  resolutions.  However,  the resolutions
are  limited  in scope  and  there is a 500 word  limit on  proponents'  written
arguments.  Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the  proxy,  we would  look at such  variables  as  length of time  required  to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.



FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Charter  provisions  requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

We support  fair price  provisions  because we feel all  shareholders  should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure  management of its own welfare so that
they may  continue  to make  decisions  in the best  interest of the company and
shareholders  even if the decision  results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes.  Therefore,  each proposal will be
decided on a case-by-case basis.

NOTE: CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE  THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.



ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS

We do not support  greenmail.  An offer  extended to one  shareholder  should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.



LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.



CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER

This proposal  releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's  effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

As a fiduciary,  we are obligated to vote in the best economic  interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that.  Therefore,  we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS

Each of the  above is  considered  on a  case-by-case  basis.  According  to the
Department of Labor,  we are not required to vote for a proposal  simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.



MILITARY ISSUES

Shareholder  proposals  regarding  military  production  must be  evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients.  As such,  decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
the client's  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic  interests of our clients.  It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.



NORTHERN IRELAND

Shareholder  proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the  discrimination  of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely  economic  set of criteria  for our ERISA  clients.  As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients,  we will vote according to
client  direction when  applicable.  Where no direction has been given,  we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.



OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW

This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's  takeover  statutes.  Example:  Delaware law requires  that a buyer must
acquire  at least 85% of the  company's  stock  before  the  buyer can  exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider  this on a  case-by-case  basis.  Our decision  will be based on the
following:

o        State of Incorporation
o        Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o        Other mitigating factors



POISON PILL

In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.



REINCORPORATION

Generally,  we support  reincorporation  for well-defined  business reasons.  We
oppose  reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent  anti-takeover  statutes that may negatively  impact
the value of the stock.



STOCK OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract,  hold and motivate directors
and  employees.  However,  each stock  option plan must be  evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o        Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o        Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o        Method of payment
o        Amount of stock already authorized  but not yet  issued  under existing
         stock option plans



SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding  shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often  exceed  the  average  level  of  shareholder  participation.  We  support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.



LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Written  consent  allows  shareholders  to initiate  and carry on a  shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting.  It  permits  action  to be taken by the  written  consent  of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect  proposed  action at a
shareholder meeting.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

As  reflected  above,  Mr.  Gabelli  manages  accounts in addition to the Trust.
Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio Manager also
has  day-to-day  management  responsibilities  with respect to one or more other
accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION  OF LIMITED TIME AND  ATTENTION.  As  indicated  above,  Mr.  Gabelli
manages multiple accounts. As a result, he will not be able to devote all of his
time to  management of the Trust.  Mr.  Gabelli,  therefore,  may not be able to
formulate  as  complete a strategy  or identify  equally  attractive  investment
opportunities  for  each of  those  accounts  as might be the case if he were to
devote all of his attention to the management of only the Trust.

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  As indicated above, Mr. Gabelli
manages  managed  accounts with investment  strategies  and/or policies that are
similar  to the  Trust.  In these  cases,  if the he  identifies  an  investment
opportunity that may be suitable for multiple  accounts,  a Fund may not be able
to take full  advantage  of that  opportunity  because  the  opportunity  may be
allocated  among  all or  many of  these  accounts  or  other  accounts  managed
primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser,  and their affiliates.  In
addition,  in the event Mr.  Gabelli  determines to purchase a security for more
than one account in an aggregate  amount that may  influence the market price of
the security,  accounts that  purchased or sold the security first may receive a
more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions.

SELECTION  OF  BROKER/DEALERS.  Because  of  Mr.  Gabelli's  position  with  the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor,  he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute  portfolio  transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING  STRATEGIES.  At times,  Mr.  Gabelli may determine that an
investment  opportunity  may be  appropriate  for only some of the  accounts for
which he exercises investment responsibility,  or may decide that certain of the
funds or accounts  should take differing  positions with respect to a particular
security.  In these cases, he may execute differing or opposite transactions for
one or more  accounts  which may affect the market  price of the security or the
execution of the  transaction,  or both,  to the  detriment of one or more other
accounts.
<PAGE>

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION.  A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other  benefits  available to Mr.  Gabelli  differ among the accounts that he
manages.  If the  structure of the  Adviser's  management  fee or the  Portfolio
Manager's  compensation  differs among accounts (such as where certain  accounts
pay higher management fees or performance-based  management fees), the Portfolio
Manager may be motivated to favor certain  accounts  over others.  The Portfolio
Manager also may be motivated  to favor  accounts in which he has an  investment
interest,  or  in  which  the  Adviser,  or  their  affiliates  have  investment
interests.  Similarly,  the desire to maintain  assets  under  management  or to
enhance a Portfolio  Manager's  performance  record or to derive other  rewards,
financial or  otherwise,  could  influence  the  Portfolio  Manager in affording
preferential  treatment to those accounts that could most significantly  benefit
the Portfolio Manager.  For example,  as reflected above, if Mr. Gabelli manages
accounts  which have  performance  fee  arrangements,  certain  portions  of his
compensation  will depend on the achievement of performance  milestones on those
accounts.  Mr.  Gabelli  could be incented to afford  preferential  treatment to
those accounts and thereby by subject to a potential conflict of interest.

The Adviser,  and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser  and their  staff  members.  However,  there is no  guarantee  that such
policies and  procedures  will be able to detect and prevent every  situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined  by  deducting  from  gross  investment  management  fees the  firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's  compensation)  allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have  arrangements  whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee  attributable  to the  liquidation  value of outstanding  preferred
stock (and Mr.  Gabelli would only receive his  percentage of such advisory fee)
if  certain  performance  levels  are met.  Additionally,  he  receives  similar
incentive  based variable  compensation  for managing other accounts  within the
firm and its  affiliates.  This method of  compensation  is based on the premise
that superior  long-term  performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher  compensation  as a result of growth of assets through  appreciation
and net investment  activity.  The level of  compensation is not determined with
specific  reference  to the  performance  of any account  against  any  specific
benchmark.  One of the other  registered  investment  companies  managed  by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance  (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his  compensation
is  adjusted  up or down  based on the  performance  of the  investment  company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance  fees.
Compensation  for managing these accounts has two  components.  One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account.  The second component is based on absolute  performance of the account,
with  respect  to  which a  percentage  of such  performance  fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli.  As an executive  officer of the  Adviser's  parent  company,  GBL, Mr.
Gabelli  also  receives ten percent of the net  operating  profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND

Mario  Gabelli  owned over  $1,000,000 of shares of the Trust as of December 31,
2007.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each  affiliated   registered   investment   company  (each  a
"COMPANY") is committed to conducting  business in  accordance  with  applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate  disclosure -- financial  and otherwise -- in compliance  with
applicable  law.  This  Code  of  Ethics,  applicable  to each  Company's  Chief
Executive Officer,  President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "SENIOR OFFICERS"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer,  you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility  to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have  leadership  responsibilities  that include  creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that  encourages  the  internal  reporting of  compliance  concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics  recognizes  that the Senior  Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies,  because the Senior Officers  currently or may in the future serve as
Senior  Officers  of each of the  Companies,  as officers  or  employees  of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "ADVISOR")
and/or  affiliates  of the  Advisor  (the  "Advisory  Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors  of other  registered  investment  companies and unregistered
investment  funds  advised  by the  Advisory  Group.  This Code of  Ethics  also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and  procedures  adopted by, the  Companies  or the  Advisory  Group govern your
conduct in  connection  with many of the  conflict of interest  situations  that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

         o        the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulation   promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 ACT");

         o        the  Investment  Advisers  Act of  1940,  and  the  rules  and
                  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  by  the  Securities  and
                  Exchange Commission (the "ADVISERS ACT");

         o        the Code of Ethics  adopted by each  Company  pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act  (collectively,  the "TRUST'S 1940
                  ACT CODE OF ETHICS");
<PAGE>

         o        one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been  reviewed and  approved by those  trustees/directors
                  (the  "DIRECTORS")  of each Company  that are not  "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTORS") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the  "ADVISORY  GROUP'S  1940 ACT
                  CODE OF ETHICS" and,  together  with such  Company's  1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 ACT CODES OF ETHICS");

         o        the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3,   Rule  17a-7  and  Rule  17e-1   under  the  1940  Act
                  (collectively, the "CONFLICT POLICIES"); and

         o        the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other  things,  conflict  of interest  situations  and related
                  matters (collectively, the "ADVISORY POLICIES").

The  provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the  Conflict  Policies  and  the  Advisory  Policies  are  referred  to  herein
collectively as the "ADDITIONAL CONFLICT RULES".

                  This Code of Ethics is  different  from,  and is  intended  to
supplement,  the  Additional  Conflict  Rules.  Accordingly,  a violation of the
Additional  Conflict  Rules by a Senior  Officer  is hereby  deemed  not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional  Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior  Officer has a  responsibility  to each Company to
act with integrity.  Integrity  requires,  among other things,  being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        act with  integrity,  including  being honest and candid while
                  still  maintaining the  confidentiality  of information  where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

         o        comply with the laws,  rules and  regulations  that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's  operations and report any suspected
                  violations  thereof  in  accordance  with  the  section  below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

         o        adhere to a high standard of business ethics.
<PAGE>

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest  for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs  when your  private  interests  interfere  in any way,  or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior  Officers  are expected to use  objective  and unbiased
standards when making  decisions that affect each Company,  keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain  inherent  conflicts of interest  because
Senior  Officers of a Company  also are or may be  officers  of other  Companies
and/or the Advisory  Group (as a result of which it is incumbent  upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner,  including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business  relationships.  When making
any  investment,  accepting  any  position  or  benefits,  participating  in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest  with respect to each Company  where
you are  receiving a personal  benefit,  you should act in  accordance  with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior  Officer  of a Company,  you should  make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and  circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the  Advisory  Group (the  "CCO") and obtain the  approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some  conflict of interest  situations  that should  always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

         o        the receipt of any  entertainment  or non-nominal  gift by the
                  Senior  Officer,  or a member of his or her  family,  from any
                  company  with  which a  Company  has  current  or  prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate  as to time and place,  and not so  frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

         o        a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other  than an  interest  arising  from the  Senior  Officer's
                  employment  by the Advisory  Group,  such as  compensation  or
                  equity ownership.

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable  disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations  in all reports  and  documents  that such  Company  files with,  or
submits to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or a national  securities
exchange  and in all other  public  communications  made by such  Company.  As a
Senior Officer,  you are required to promote  compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company's  standards,  policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

         o        familiarize   himself   or   herself   with   the   disclosure
                  requirements  applicable  to  each  Company  as  well  as  the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

         o        not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent  auditors,  such Company's counsel,
                  any  counsel  to  the  Independent   Directors,   governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a  violation  of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations,  policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must  report  that  information  on a  timely  basis  to the  CCO or  report  it
