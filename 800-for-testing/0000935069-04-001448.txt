                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.   The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust  (the  "Utility  Trust")  is  a
closed-end,   non-diversified  management  investment  company  organized  as  a
Delaware  statutory  trust  on  February  25,  1999  and  registered  under  the
Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  whose  primary
objective is long-term  growth of capital and income.  The Utility  Trust had no
operations  prior to July 9,  1999,  other  than the sale of  10,000  shares  of
beneficial  interest for $100,000 to The Gabelli  Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity
Trust") at $10.00 per share.  On July 9, 1999,  the Utility  Trust had a 4 for 3
stock split making the balance of Utility  Trust shares held by the Equity Trust
as 13,333. On July 9, 1999, the Equity Trust contributed $79,487,260 in cash and
securities  in exchange  for shares of the Utility  Trust,  and on the same date
distributed  such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders of record on July 1, 1999
at the rate of one share of the Utility Trust for every ten shares of the Equity
Trust. Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

      Effective  August 1, 2002, the Utility Trust modified its  non-fundamental
investment  policy to increase,  from 65% to 80%, the portion of its assets that
it will  invest,  under normal  market  conditions,  in common  stocks and other
securities  of foreign and domestic  companies  involved in providing  products,
services or equipment for (i) the generation or distribution of electricity, gas
and water and (ii) telecommunications services or infrastructure operations (the
"80% Policy").

      The 80% Policy may be changed without shareholder  approval.  However, the
Utility  Trust has  adopted a policy to  provide  shareholders  with at least 60
days' notice of the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close, market conditions change significantly, certain
foreign securities may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the
Board.  Debt instruments that are not credit impaired with remaining  maturities
of 60 days or less are valued at  amortized  cost,  unless the Board  determines
such does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these securities
will be valued at their fair value as determined by the Board.  Debt instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the latest average of the bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing  bid  price.  Futures  contracts  are  valued  at the  official  closing
settlement  price of the  exchange  or board  of trade on which  the  applicable
contract is traded.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available  financial and non-financial  information about
the company;  comparisons  to the  valuation and changes in valuation of similar
securities,  including a comparison of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S.
dollar value ADR securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of
any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The  Utility  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve  Bank of New York,  with member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System or
with other  brokers or dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the
Adviser  and  reviewed  by the Board of  Trustees.  Under the terms of a typical
repurchase  agreement,  the Utility Trust takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Utility
Trust to  resell,  the  obligation  at an  agreed-upon  price and time,  thereby
determining the yield during the Utility  Trust's  holding  period.  The Utility
Trust will always  receive and maintain  securities as  collateral  whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount invested by the Utility Trust in each  agreement.  The Utility Trust will
make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of
book entry transfer of the  collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the
extent that any  repurchase  transaction  exceeds one business day, the value of
the collateral is  marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of
the collateral.  If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines
or if bankruptcy  proceedings  are  commenced  with respect to the seller of the
security,  realization  of the collateral by the Utility Trust may be delayed or
limited.

      FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSACTION.  The books and records of the Utility Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments
and other  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  at the
exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period,  and purchases and sales of
investment  securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing on the respective  dates of such  transactions.  Unrealized gains and
losses,  which result from changes in foreign  exchange  rates and/or changes in
market    prices   of    securities,    have   been   included   in   unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency transactions.  Net
realized  foreign  currency gains and losses  resulting from changes in exchange
rates  include  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  between  trade  date  and
settlement  date  on  investment  securities   transactions,   foreign  currency
transactions  and the  difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends
recorded on the books of the Utility  Trust and the amounts  actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

      DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and capital gain
distributions  are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
States.  Distributions  to  Shareholders  of  the  Utility  Trust's  5.625%  Tax
Advantaged  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  and  Series B  Auction  Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are accrued on a daily
basis and are determined as described in Note 5.

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  reclassifications  were made to
increase  distributions  in excess of net  investment  income for $27,100 and to
decrease  distributions  in  excess  of net  realized  gain on  investments  for
$27,100, with an offsetting adjustment to additional paid-in capital.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended December
31, 2003 were as follows:

                                                           YEAR ENDED

                                                   ---------------------------
                                                     COMMON         PREFERRED
                                                   -----------     -----------
 DISTRIBUTIONS PAID FROM:
 Ordinary income
    (inclusive of short term capital gains) ..     $ 1,659,283     $   281,763
 Net long term capital gains .................       3,642,522         555,151
 Non-taxable return of capital ...............       7,047,175              --

                                                   ===========     ===========

      The tax character of amounts distributed in 2004 which exceed the ordinary
income and net capital gains of the Fund will be treated as a non-taxable return
of capital.  Such  determination can only be made upon completion of the taxable
year.

      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal  Revenue Code  applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

      Dividends and interest from non-U.S. sources received by the Utility Trust
are generally subject to non-U.S.  withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%.
Such  withholding  taxes  may be  reduced  or  eliminated  under  the  terms  of
applicable U.S. income tax treaties,  and the Utility Trust intends to undertake
any procedural steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

      As of December 31, 2003, the  components of accumulated  earnings/(losses)
on a tax basis were as follows:

          Net unrealized appreciation on investments     $ 8,129,469
          Dividends payable ........................         (29,669)
                                                         -----------
          Total accumulated gain ...................     $ 8,099,800
                                                         ===========

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Utility Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser which  provides that the Utility Trust will pay the Adviser on the first
business day of each month a fee for the previous month equal on an annual basis
to 1.00% of the value of the  Utility  Trust's  average  daily net  assets  plus
liquidation value of preferred stock. In accordance with the Advisory Agreement,
the Adviser  provides a continuous  investment  program for the Utility  Trust's
portfolio and oversees the  administration of all aspects of the Utility Trust's
business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on the
incremental assets attributable to each series of the Cumulative Preferred Stock
if the total  return of the net asset value of the common  shares of the Utility
Trust, including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not
exceed the stated dividend rate of the respective Cumulative Preferred Stock for
the year.

      The Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the common  shares is
monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the net asset
value of the common shares  exceeds the stated  dividend rate of the  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months  ended June 30,  2004,  the
Trust's  total return on the net asset value of the common  shares  exceeded the
stated  dividend rate of the Series B Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.
Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets, but not on the assets of the
Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock.  Management fees were reduced by the amount
of $149,180.

      During the six months ended June 30, 2004, Gabelli & Company, Inc. and its
affiliates  received  $80,330 in brokerage  commissions as a result of executing
agency transactions in portfolio securities on behalf of the Utility Trust.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      In connection with the 2003 Rights Offering, holders of unexercised rights
to  purchase  common  shares  of the  Utility  Trust's  ("Rights")  were able to
instruct the Subscription Agent (EquiServe Trust Company) to sell such Rights on
their behalf.  The Subscription Agent was permitted to effect such sales through
Gabelli & Company,  unless the Subscription  Agent was able to negotiate a lower
commission  rate with an independent  broker.  Total  commissions  from sales of
Rights effected by the Subscription  Agent through Gabelli & Company amounted to
$22,630 for the year ended December 31, 2003.

      The cost of  calculating  the Trust's net asset value per share is a Trust
expense pursuant to the Investment  Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the
Adviser. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Utility Trust reimbursed
the Adviser  $17,400 in  connection  with the cost of computing  the Trust's net
asset value.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.   Cost  of  purchases  and  proceeds  from  sales  of
securities,  other than short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
2004 aggregated $39,960,060 and $11,327,871, respectively.

5.  CAPITAL.  The Board of  Trustees  of the Utility  Trust has  authorized  the
repurchase  of its shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a
discount of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board of Trustees may
determine from time to time) from the net asset value of the shares.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2004,  the Utility Trust did not repurchase any shares
of beneficial interest in the open market.

      On August 20, 2003, the Utility Trust  distributed one transferable  right
for each of the 15,298,490  common shares  outstanding to shareholders of record
on that date. Three rights were required to purchase one additional common share
at the subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders who exercised their
full  primary   subscription  rights  were  eligible  for  an  over-subscription
privilege  entitling  them to subscribe,  subject to certain  limitations  and a
pro-rata  allotment,  for any  additional  shares not purchased  pursuant to the
primary  subscription plus such additional amounts as authorized by the Board of
Trustees in accordance with the registration statement.  The subscription period
expired on September 25, 2003. The rights offering was fully and over-subscribed
resulting in the issuance of 7,500,000 common shares and proceeds of $52,500,000
to the Utility Trust,  prior to the deduction of estimated expenses of $500,000.
The net asset  value per share of the  Utility  Trust  common  shareholders  was
enhanced by approximately  $0.12 per share as a result of the issuance of shares
above net asset value.

      Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

      On July 31, 2003,  the Utility Trust  received net proceeds of $28,877,500
(after  underwriting  discounts of $945,000 and estimated  offering  expenses of
$177,500)  from the  public  offering  of  1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A
Cumulative Preferred Stock. Commencing July 31, 2008 and thereafter, the Utility
Trust, at its option, may redeem the 5.625% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock
in whole or in part at the liquidation value price.  During the six months ended
June 30, 2004,  the Utility Trust  repurchased  15,300 shares of 5.625% Series A
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in the open  market  at a cost of  $353,154  and an
average discount of approximately 7.72% from its liquidation value of $25.00 per
share. All repurchased shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock have
been  retired.  At June  30,  2004,  1,184,700  shares  of the  5.625%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$13,883.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      On July 31, 2003,  the Utility Trust  received net proceeds of $24,572,500
(after  underwriting  discounts of $250,000 and estimated  offering  expenses of
$177,500)  from the public  offering  of 1,000  shares of Series B Auction  Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is  generally  held  every 7 days,  is  expected  to vary with  short-term
interest rates.  The rates of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
ranged  from 1.05% to 1.55% for the six months  ended  June 30,  2004.  Existing
shareholders  may  submit  an order to hold,  bid or sell  such  shares  on each
auction date. Series B Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock shareholders may
also trade shares in the secondary market. The Utility Trust, at its option, may
redeem the Series B Auction Rate Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part
at the liquidation value price at any time. During the six months ended June 30,
2004,  the Utility Trust did not  repurchase any shares of Series B Auction Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  At June 30,  2004,  1,000  shares of the Series B
Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  outstanding  with an annualized
dividend rate of 1.38 percent per share and accrued dividends amounted to $958.

      The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the holders of Common Stock (one vote per share) and will vote together
with holders of shares of Common Stock as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of Common
Stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other  things,  changes in the Fund's  subclassification  as a
closed-end   investment  company  or  changes  in  its  fundamental   investment
restrictions.  The income  received  on the  Fund's  assets may vary in a manner
unrelated to the fixed and variable rates,  which could have either a beneficial
or  detrimental  impact on net investment  income and gains  available to common
shareholders.

      Under  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  (EITF)   promulgating   Topic  D-98,
Classification  and  Measurement of Redeemable  Securities,  which was issued on
July 19, 2001, preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets
are to be  classified  outside  of  permanent  equity  to the  extent  that  the
redemption is at a fixed or  determinable  price and at the option of the holder
or upon the  occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the
issuer.  Subject to the guidance of the EITF,  the Fund's  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock has been reclassified outside of permanent equity (net assets attributable
to common stock shareholders) in the accompanying financial statements.

6. INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION. Because the Utility Trust primarily invests in common
stocks and other  securities  of foreign and  domestic  companies in the utility
industry,  its portfolio may be subject to greater risk and market  fluctuations
than a portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7. OTHER MATTERS.  On October 7, 2003,  the Fund's  Adviser  received a subpoena
from the Attorney  General of the State of New York  requesting  information  on
mutual fund shares trading practices. The Adviser has also received requests for
information from the SEC regarding  mutual fund trading  practices and valuation
of portfolio  securities.  The Adviser has responded to the  requests.  The Fund
does not believe that these matters will have a material  adverse  effect on the
Fund's financial position or the results of its operations.

8.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It is the  Policy  of The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust  ("Utility  Trust")  to
automatically   reinvest   dividends.   As  a   "registered"   shareholder   you
automatically  become a participant in the Utility  Trust's  Automatic  Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan authorizes the Utility Trust to issue
shares to participants  upon an income dividend or a capital gains  distribution
regardless  of whether  the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net
asset value. All  distributions  to shareholders  whose shares are registered in
their  own  names  will be  automatically  reinvested  pursuant  to the  Plan in
additional  shares of the Utility Trust.  Plan participants may send their stock
certificates  to  EquiServe  Trust  Company  ("EquiServe")  to be held in  their
dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to receive their
distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                           The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                 c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43011
                           Providence, RI 02940-3011

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

      SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must
do so in  writing  or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above
mentioned  address  or  telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,
address  and  account  number.  The  cost  to  liquidate  shares  is  $2.50  per
transaction as well as the brokerage commission incurred.  Brokerage charges are
expected to be less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      If your  shares  are held in the name of a broker,  bank or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in  your  own  name  your  dividends  will  be   automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of shares of Common Stock  distributed to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever the market price of the Utility Trust's Common Stock is equal to
or  exceeds  net asset  value at the time  shares are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of Common Stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Utility Trust's Common Stock. The valuation
date is the dividend or distribution  payment date or, if that date is not a New
York Stock Exchange trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of
the Common Stock at the time of valuation exceeds the market price of the Common
Stock,  participants will receive shares from the Utility Trust valued at market
price.  If the  Utility  Trust  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  EquiServe will buy Common Stock in the open
market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,  for the  participants'
accounts, except that EquiServe will endeavor to terminate purchases in the open
market  and  cause the  Utility  Trust to issue  shares  at net asset  value if,
following the  commencement  of such  purchases,  the market value of the Common
Stock exceeds the then current net asset value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

      The Utility  Trust  reserves the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as
applied to any voluntary  cash  payments  made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan
at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by EquiServe on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase  their  investment in the Utility  Trust.  In order to
participate in the Voluntary Cash Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have their
shares registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments  in the Utility  Trust's
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  EquiServe will use these funds to purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  EquiServe  will charge each
shareholder  who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata  share of the  brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary  cash payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43011,  Providence,  RI
02940-3011  such that  EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately  10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment  until the next purchase
date.  A payment  may be  withdrawn  without  charge if  notice is  received  by
EquiServe at least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Utility Trust.

         90 days of the filing date of the report that  includes the  disclosure
         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
         Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
         240.15d-15(b)).


     (b) There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an
         annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to

         reporting.
