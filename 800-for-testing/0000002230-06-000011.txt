Investment income dividends and capital gains distributions are taken in
additional shares. This chart covers the years 1991-2005. Fees for the
reinvestment of interim dividends are assumed as 2% of the amount reinvested
(maximum of $2.50) and commissions of $0.05 per share. There is no charge for
reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions, or the sale of any shares. These results should not be
considered representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which
may be realized in the future.

                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Year in Review
We are pleased to report that the Fund's total return on net assets for the
year was 4.5%, slightly below that of the S&P 500 Index at 4.9%, but
significantly above the Dow Jones Industrial Average's return of 1.7%. Our
broadly-diversified portfolio of stocks benefited from our emphasis on
dividend-paying issues but was affected somewhat by our focus on
large-capitalization, relatively low-risk stocks.

Through the first ten months of the year, the Fund outperformed the S&P 500,
returning 1.5% compared to the Index's 1.1% return. The Fund's performance in
December also beat that of the Index for the month. During the month of
November, however, the situation was different, as the Index, led by the
smallest capitalization companies and those with the highest volatility,
outperformed the Fund by 1.8%. This difference in November caused the Index to
beat the Fund by 0.4% for the full year.

The U.S. equity market moved very little during the year as a whole, though
some sectors did significantly better than others. Energy prices were a focus
of attention for much of the year, as were the actions by the Federal Reserve
in increasing short-term interest rates. Investors believed that both would
potentially slow domestic economic activity and perhaps cause a recession. The
hurricanes that came ashore on the Gulf Coast and Florida not only caused
energy prices to jump, but also dramatically slowed economic activity in those
areas. Earnings estimates for many companies were reduced to reflect slower
growth, causing valuations to shrink or expand only modestly. As a result,
there was little inclination to bid up stocks in the U.S. Many money managers
sought investments outside the United States in areas where growth was more
likely to accelerate. Others, such as ourselves, focused on companies in
sectors that would not be as severely impacted by slower growth and companies
with large overseas operations. Examples of these include our investments in
Bunge, a leading global agriproducts processor, as well as the more widely
known Avon Products and Del Monte Foods. With businesses generating strong cash
flows and industrial capacity utilization averaging about 80%, we also
anticipated improvement in the industrial sector, investing in Automatic Data
Processing and Cintas, the latter company a beneficiary of North American jobs
growth reflecting its leading position in uniforms. As with all of our
investments, these were made for the long term, and are expected to perform
well over a time frame of several years.

Our large investments, relative to the S&P 500, in utilities, telecommunication
services, and energy stocks, and our relatively small exposure to consumer
discretionary stocks were positive contributors to our performance in 2005. Our
holdings in consumer staples and health care stocks did well during the year,
while the materials and industrial sectors lagged. Our financial and technology
stocks, though underweighted compared to the Index, were negative contributors
and were largely responsible for the difference between the Fund's performance
and that of the S&P 500. There were significant changes in our holdings within
both of these sectors which should improve their relative performance in the
future.

Investment Results

At the end of 2005 our net assets were $1,266,728,652 or $14.71 per share on
86,099,607 shares outstanding. This compares with $1,295,548,900 or $15.04 per
share on 86,135,292 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2005 was $18,288,551 compared to $19,008,405 for
2004. These earnings are equal to $0.22 and $0.23 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. The
extraordinary dividend that Microsoft paid in 2004, which added $2,400,000 or
$0.03 to our earnings that year, was not repeated in 2005. Our 0.45% expense
ratio (expenses to average net assets) in 2005 was once again very low compared
to the fund industry in general.

Net realized gains amounted to $53,817,950 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments decreased from $343,670,412 at
December 31, 2004 to $316,477,367 at year end.

Dividends and Distributions

The total dividends and distributions paid in 2005 were $0.86 per share
compared to $0.90 in 2004. As announced on November 10, 2005, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.08 and capital gains of
$0.63 was made on December 27, 2005, both realized and taxable in 2005. On
January 12, 2006, an additional distribution of $0.05 per share was declared
payable March 1, 2006, representing the balance of undistributed net investment
income and capital gains earned during 2005 and an initial distribution from
2006 net investment income, all taxable to shareholders in 2006.

Outlook for 2006

Many of the factors that impacted economic growth in 2005 remain strong
influences on potential growth in 2006. Principal among these are rising
interest rates and high energy prices. The Federal Reserve increased short-term
rates eight times in 2005 after five increases in 2004. The rate changes have
so far had little impact on longer-term rates, resulting in a recent inversion
of the yield curve in which the rate on ten-year Treasury bonds is lower than
the rate on two-year notes. In the past, such an inversion has been a harbinger
of slower growth, if not recession. Nonetheless, the Fed is expected to raise
rates two to four more times in 2006 in order to avoid significant price
inflation. Expectations of the Fed action are wide-ranging due to the
retirement of Chairman Greenspan and the accession of Mr. Bernanke to that
position. Once Mr. Bernanke takes over, it is anticipated that the direction of
the Fed will become clearer.

Energy prices in this country have risen dramatically over the past two years
due to increasing worldwide demand, principally in the Far East and the U.S.,
and very limited increases in supplies of both oil and natural gas. Further,
the damage caused by hurricanes in 2005 to U.S. oil and gas production and
processing facilities was extensive. After rising 33% in 2004, crude oil prices
rose another 36% in 2005 to close the year at $61.04 per barrel. While energy
in the form of oil and gas constitutes a much smaller part of the economy now
than in the past, the impact on industrial production and transportation costs
is still sizeable. Of as much concern is the effect on consumers, who comprise
two-thirds of the economy. Gasoline prices peaked above $3 per gallon and
remain well above 2004 prices, while natural gas, used for heating in much of
the Northeast and Midwest, closed 93% higher in 2005 than at year-end 2004.
Winter weather has been mild to date and natural gas prices have fallen, but
consumers will experience heating costs some 40% above last winter on top of
the higher gasoline costs. The consequence is that spending on goods and
services is being redirected to energy. This, combined with slow growth in
wages, has resulted in a decline in consumer spending that is likely to
continue in 2006 and act as a damper on economic growth.

As mentioned previously, manufacturing capacity in this country is being
utilized at about an 80% level, normally a point at which companies begin to
add capacity in order to avoid backlogs and bottlenecks. Through 2004 and most
of 2005, spending on machinery and equipment grew at a solid, though
unexceptional, pace while companies accumulated cash and/or repurchased shares.
With an anticipated slowdown in U.S. consumer spending and a surprisingly
strong dollar inhibiting exports, the pace of industrial expansion is more
likely to slow than accelerate. The one factor that may impact this projection
is the ongoing effort to rebuild the areas along the Gulf Coast that were hard
hit by the hurricanes. Substantial government funding and private investment
are being directed at this project. With the exception of the energy industry,
however, there is not a large industrial base in the area to be rebuilt; so
most funds will be directed at infrastructure and residential construction,
benefiting a relatively narrow segment of the economy.

With the unexciting economic outlook discussed, the likelihood of another year
of single-digit returns in the stock market appears strong. S&P 500 earnings
growth has been decelerating, albeit from a high level, for over two years and
earnings are expected to grow by only 7% in 2006. Massive share repurchases
will result in higher earnings per share growth, perhaps as much as 2%, but
should not influence valuations. The principal argument for better returns
hangs on the decline in valuations that has already occurred. In generating
large amounts of cash and not reinvesting in the business, companies have
improved the condition of their balance sheets but have not invested in a means
of growth. Since cash generates modest returns for shareholders, it does not
add much to the valuation of a company. Should managements decide to spend
money on capacity additions or acquisitions, there would be reason to expect
that valuations should rise.

We believe that the energy, utility, and industrial segments of the economy
will selectively invest in operations, and that continued consolidation (by
acquisition) in the financial arena is likely. With overweight positions in the
first three and holdings in major banks as well as smaller regional ones, the
portfolio is poised to do well in 2006. Our emphasis on large-capitalization
companies with broad geographic exposure, solid long-term growth prospects, and
attractive dividends should also inure to the benefit of shareholders this year.

Share Repurchase Program

On December 8, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over
the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as
in the past, namely that shares can be repurchased when the discount of the
market price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2006 through January 25, 2006, a total of 195,800 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $2,528,171 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 14.3%.

                                  ----------

Director Changes

There have been a number of changes in the composition of the Board of
Directors in the past year, some of which were noted in our quarterly reports.
Mr. W. David MacCallan, Chairman of the Company for twenty years before
retiring in 1991, passed away in August. Mr. Landon Peters passed away earlier
in the year and Mr. W. Perry Neff retired. Both had been directors for many
years and their advice and guidance are missed. In October, Dr. Susan Schwab
was nominated to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative and confirmed in November,
necessitating her resignation from the Board. Though a director for only five
years, Dr. Schwab brought a fresh perspective and broad international
experience to the Board that will be difficult to replace. To address these
departures, the Board of Directors elected two new directors, Dr. Roger W. Gale
and Dr. Craig R. Smith, who joined the Board effective December 1, 2005. Each
has broad experience in corporate governance. In addition, Dr. Gale brings to
the Board specific knowledge of the energy and utility industries, and
Dr. Smith brings specific knowledge of the pharmaceutical and biotech
industries. We welcome them and look forward to their participation in the
Board's activities.

                                  ----------

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Orlando, Florida on March 28, 2006, is expected to be mailed on or about
February 17, 2006.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2005 was $997,820,714, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $316,826,033, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $427,836,385 and $111,010,352, respectively.
As of December 31, 2005, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $2,762,118
of undistributed ordinary income and $54,856 of undistributed long-term capital
gain.

Distributions paid by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2005 were
classified as ordinary income of $26,198,384, and long-term capital gain of
$46,109,040. In comparison, distributions paid by the Company during the year
ended December 31, 2004 were classified as ordinary income of $22,205,063, and
long-term capital gain of $53,052,651. The distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within
the Company's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $160,621,657 and
$194,270,442, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31, 2005 can be
found on page 17.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2005 were as follows:

range from 50% to 75% of total portfolio assets. The fixed income portion of
the portfolio may range from 25% to 50% of total portfolio assets and cash may

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Company anticipates making no
contribution to the plans in 2006.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

all employees. The Company expensed contributions of $181,236 and $147,811 for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The
Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Stock-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") permits the issuance of
stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146
shares of the Company's Common Stock at the fair market value on the date of
grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation rights
is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during
subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less than one year
after the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are exercisable beginning
not less than two years after the date of grant. The stock appreciation rights
allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise their options and
receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference between the option
exercise price and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of
surrender. All options terminate 10 years from the date of grant if not
exercised. With the adoption of the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan at
the 2005 Annual Meeting, no further grants will be made under the 1985 Plan,
although unexercised awards granted in 2004 and prior years remain outstanding.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2005, and
changes during the period then ended, is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the year ended December 31, 2005 was $78,689.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan") permits the grant of
stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock incentives to key
employees and all non-employee directors. The 2005 Plan provides for the
issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's Common Stock. Restricted
stock was granted to key employees on April 27, 2005 at fair market value on
that date, vesting over a three year period. Restricted stock units were
granted to non-employee directors on April 27, 2005 and to new directors on
December 1, 2005 at fair market value on grant date and vest over a one year
period from the date of grant. The total fair value of units that vested in
2005 was $9,889 due to the death of a director, which thereby accelerated the
vesting schedule. The number of shares of Common Stock which remain available

</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted under the 2005 Plan are recognized over the requisite service period
based on the fair value of the awards on grant date. Any unearned compensation
is subsequently expensed as services are rendered. The fair value of restricted
stock is based on the average of the high and low market price on the date an
award is granted. The total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to
employees for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $39,129. The total
compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors
under the 2005 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $62,844. As of
December 31, 2005, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $177,421
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the
2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.9 years.

7. Expenses

The aggregate remuneration paid or accrued during the year ended December 31,
2005 to officers and directors amounted to $2,546,465, of which $297,094 was
paid as fees to directors who were not officers.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2005, the Company had securities on loan of
$51,293,357, and held collateral of $52,716,334, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at December 31, 2005, the results of
its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

                     SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Adams Express?

Adams Express Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Pacific Exchange. The stock's ticker symbol is "ADX" and may be bought and sold
through registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to
assist you in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan
(see page 22).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers and on
Mondays in The Wall Street Journal in a table titled "Closed-End Funds." The
table compares the net asset value at the close of the week's last business day
to the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or
premium.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 22.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

                                                                             21

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Company presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a) three
interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1, and (b) a

balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election
card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
election by notifying their brokerage house representative.

On  June 12, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a code  of

director on the registrant's audit committee whom the  board
of   directors  has  determined  meets  such  definition  is

respectively.

   (h)  The registrant's audit committee has considered  the
provision  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of  the  non-audit

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies'  managements, we  give
significant  weight to  the recommendations of the company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations of the company's management.   When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote on anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the company's management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded management's  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   management's
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

(a)  (1) Douglas  G.  Ober, Chairman and  Chief  Executive
     Officer, and Joseph M. Truta, President, comprise the 2
     person portfolio management team for the registrant. Mr.
     Ober and  Mr. Truta have  served as  portfolio managers
     for the registrant since 1991. This information  is  as
     of February 13,  2006.  Mr.  Ober is the lead member of
     the portfolio management team. Mr. Ober  and Mr.  Truta
     receive  investment  recommendations  from  a  team  of
     research analysts and make decisions jointly  about any
     equity transactions in  the portfolio.  Concurrence  of
     both portfolio  managers  is required for an investment
     recommendation to be approved.

     (2)   Mr.   Ober  and  Mr.  Truta  also  comprise   the
     portfolio   management  team  for   registrant's   non-
     controlled    affiliate,    Petroleum    &    Resources
     Corporation   (Petroleum),  a   registered   investment
     company  with  total net assets of $761,913,652  as  of
     December   31,  2005.  Mr.  Ober  is  Chairman,   Chief
     Executive  Officer and President of Petroleum  and  Mr.
     Truta is Executive Vice President. This information  is
     as  of February 13, 2006. The Petroleum fund is a  non-
     diversified  fund  focusing on the energy  and  natural
     resources sectors and Adams is a diversified fund  with
     a   different   focus,  and  there  are  few   material
     conflicts  of  interest that may  arise  in  connection
     with  the portfolio managers' management of both funds.
     The  funds  do  not  buy or sell  securities  or  other
     portfolio   holdings  to  or  from   the   other,   and
     procedures  and  policies are  in  place  covering  the
     sharing  of  expenses and the allocation of  investment
     opportunities,    including    bunched    orders    and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

   (3)   The  portfolio managers are compensated  through  a
   three-component plan, consisting of salary,  annual  cash
   incentive     compensation,    and    equity    incentive
   compensation. The value of each component in any year  is
   determined  by  the  Compensation  Committee,   comprised
   solely  of independent director members of the  Board  of
   Directors.  Salaries are determined by using  appropriate
   industry  surveys and information about the local  market
   as  well  as general inflation statistics. Cash incentive
   compensation  is based on a combination of  absolute  and
   relative  fund  performance  over  one  and  three   year
   periods  as  well as individual success at meeting  goals
   and  objectives  set  by the Board of  Directors  at  the
   beginning  of each year. Target incentives are set  based
   on  80% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 60%
   of   salary  for  the  President.  Two-thirds   of   each
   individual's  annual  cash incentive  is  based  on  fund
   performance  and  one  third on individual  success.  The
   portion based on performance is determined using a  scale
   in  which the target can be earned by absolute fund  pre-
   tax  performance of 10%. The scale ranges  from  zero  to
   125%  of  target.  The  result is  then  modified  by  an
   average  of  the one and three year performance  relative
   to  the  S&P 500, whereby each one percent outperformance
   or  underperformance by the fund adds or deducts 5%  from
   the  percentage of target earned based on the scale.  The
   maximum percentage of target which may be earned is  200%
   and  the  minimum is zero. Equity incentive compensation,
   based  on  a plan approved by shareholders in  2005,  can
   take  several  forms.  Following approval  of  the  plan,
   grants  of  restricted stock were made to  the  portfolio
   managers   in   April  2005,  with   vesting   in   equal
   proportions  over a three year period. The  size  of  the
   grants was determined by the Compensation Committee  with
   the  assistance  of  an outside compensation  consultant.
   The  basis  for  the portfolio managers'  cash  incentive
   compensation determinations for Petroleum is the same  as
   for  Adams,  except  that the portion  of  the  incentive
   based  upon fund performance uses the Dow Jones  Oil  and
   Gas  Index and the S&P 500 Index as the benchmarks  in  a
   70%/30% ratio, over a one and three year period.  All  of
   the above information is as of December 31, 2005.

  (4)   Using  a  valuation date of December 31,  2005,  Mr.
  Ober beneficially owns equity securities in registrant  of
  over   $1,000,000.  Mr.  Truta  beneficially  owns  equity
  securities in registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 13, 2006, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  13, 2006, the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and

1940, are attached.
