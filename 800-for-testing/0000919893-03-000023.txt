TENDER OFFER. On April 24, 2003, the Fund commenced a tender offer for up to
6,656,425 shares, or 15%, of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price per share
equal to 92.5% of net asset value per share as of May 22, 2003, the expiration
date of the tender offer. A total of 13,861,221.1833 shares were properly

final date for withdrawals. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer,
6,656,425 shares were accepted by the Fund for a purchase price of $9.97 per
share. Because more than 15% of the Fund's outstanding shares were tendered, the
number of shares accepted for payment by the Fund was pro-rated based on the
total number of shares properly tendered by each shareholder.

SEMIANNUAL REPORT



TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR FUND'S GOAL: TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND SEEKS LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION BY
INVESTING AT LEAST 45% OF ITS TOTAL ASSETS IN THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF "CHINA
COMPANIES," AS DEFINED IN THE FUND'S PROSPECTUS.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are pleased to bring you this semiannual report for Templeton Dragon Fund
covering the period ended June 30, 2003. During the six months under review,
China's and India's economies recorded healthy gross domestic product (GDP)
expansion rates. Recent data showed some strong gains as China's GDP grew 8.9%
annualized in April, after growing 9.9% annualized in the first quarter of 2003.
1 May 2003 exports and imports surged 37.3% and 40.9% over May 2002, resulting
in a trade surplus of US$2.2 billion, while May's industrial output rose 13.7%
over May 2002. 2 Foreign direct investment inflows slowed in April and May due,
in part, to the effects of China's battle with severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS); however, a solid 48% overall gain was tallied for the first five months
of 2003. 3 In efforts to help China's economy maintain its momentum, the
government announced tax relief measures aimed at supporting businesses impacted
by SARS outbreaks. Standard & Poor's, an independent credit rating agency,
revised its outlook on China's long-term foreign-currency sovereign debt to
positive from stable in April.

Hong Kong's GDP grew 4.5% annualized in first quarter 2003 compared with first
quarter 2002, following a revised 5.1% annualized expansion in the preceding
quarter. However, the government reduced its growth forecast for 2003 to 1.5%
from 3.0% largely due to the SARS outbreak in the second quarter. Retail sales
also suffered during the six-month period, decreasing 15.2% in April compared
with April 2002. 4 As could be expected, the negatively impacted tourism and
service sectors contributed to a rise in unemployment. Positively, Hong Kong
ranked as the world's fourth most competitive small economy, up from tenth last
year, according to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2003, an international
survey of business and economic efficiency. Additionally, China and Hong Kong
signed a free-trade agreement at the end of June, an indication of China opening
its economy to international competition.

In Taiwan, domestic demand weakened, and first quarter 2003 GDP grew an
annualized 3.2%, compared with 4.2% annualized in 2002's fourth quarter.
Fortunately, private consumption rose in the first quarter, and unemployment
fell to its lowest level since July 2001 to 4.9% in April after fewer layoffs
and factory closures. 5 Exports rose in May largely due to strong demand from
China, contributing to the 8.1% increase for the first five months of the year,
while imports rose 12.8% during the same period. 6

In efforts to attract foreign investors to Taiwan's financial markets, the
Securities and Futures Commission and the Taiwan Central Bank eased the
qualifications and application process of

For the six months ended June 30, 2003, Templeton Dragon Fund delivered a
+25.76% cumulative total return in market price terms and +19.82% in net asset
value terms, as shown in the Performance Summary on page 7.

In May, we completed a tender offer and bought back a total 6,656,425 shares of
the Fund's common stock. We funded the purchase largely by decreasing certain
stock holdings that we believed were less attractively valued. During the
six-month period, war in Iraq and fear of SARS brought significant price
movements to many financial markets. These developments coupled with changes in
fundamentals with some companies held by the Fund were some of the major factors
behind the portfolio changes.

During the period, we reduced our exposure to China H shares (Hong Kong-listed
Chinese companies), as we found some valuations growing expensive, in our view.
Key sales included Tsingtao Brewery, Zhejiang Expressway, Angang New Steel and
Jiangsu Expressway. These sales also reduced the Fund's transportation
infrastructure exposure. The Fund still held 27.7% of total net assets in China
H shares as of June 30, 2003. Other notable sales included Hong Kong's Dairy
Farm, as gains were realized, and Red Chip shares (Hong Kong-listed companies
with significant exposure to China) in Cosco Pacific and China Pharmaceutical,
which were sold at a loss. On an individual stock level, key contributors to the
Fund's performance during the six-month period were Sinopec, China's

second-largest oil company, and Tsingtao Brewery, China's largest brewery.

We increased the Fund's exposure to Taiwan by purchasing stocks trading at
valuations we believed to be attractive. Key purchases and contributors to Fund
performance included Delta Electronics, the world's largest power supplies
producer; Asustek, the world's largest manufacturer of motherboards; Advantech,
Taiwan's largest industrial computers producer; and Sunplus Technology, a
Taiwanese integrated circuit company.

As we searched for what were, in our view, undervalued stocks during the period,
we invested in the Shenzhen B market in China by purchasing Guangdong Electric
Power, the largest listed power generation group in Guangdong province. Key
Singapore investments included Singapore Airlines and Singapore Press,
purchased, in part, for its dominant market position.

Within the Fund's top 10 holdings, Petrochina, Beijing Datang, Citic Pacific and
Hong Kong & Shanghai Hotels replaced TCL, Tsingtao Brewery, Zhejiang Expressway
and Jiangsu Expressway during the reporting period. As of June 30, 2003, the
Fund's top three sectors were oil and gas, food and drug retailing, and
industrial conglomerates. We believe in the region's potential for economic
business growth over the long term. Thus, we will continue to search for
investments we believe are well positioned for the long term.

Of course, investing in any emerging market means accepting a certain amount of
volatility and, in some cases, the consequences of severe market corrections.
For example, Hong Kong's equity market has increased 339.54% in the last 15



                                                             SEMIANNUAL REPORT 5

years, but has suffered 7 quarterly declines of more than 15% each during that
time. 7 Investing in emerging markets, particularly "China companies," also
entails special considerations, including risks related to market and currency
volatility, adverse economic, social and political developments, and the
markets' relatively small size and lesser liquidity. Also, as a non-diversified
investment company, the Fund may invest in a relatively small number of issuers,
which could result in a greater risk of loss.

Thank you for investing in Templeton Dragon Fund. We appreciate your confidence
and welcome your comments.

Ongoing market volatility can significantly affect short-term performance; more
recent returns may differ from those shown. Since markets can go down as well as
up, investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions,
currency volatility, economic instability and social and political developments
of countries where the Fund invests. Emerging markets involve heightened risks
related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with their
relatively small size and lesser liquidity. Also, as a non-diversified
investment company investing in "China companies," the Fund may invest in a
relatively small number of issuers and, as a result, be subject to a greater
risk of loss with respect to its portfolio securities. You may have a gain or
loss when you sell your shares.
Past performance does not guarantee future results.

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.
Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited)


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 45% of its total
assets in the equity securities of "China companies," as defined in the Fund's
prospectus.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund. The following
summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange or NASDAQ are
valued at the latest reported sales price. Over-the-counter securities and
listed securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of
the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by management
in accordance with procedures established by the Board of Directors.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes, and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included
in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.



                                                         SEMIANNUAL REPORT    15
                                                                          <PAGE>

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available to the Fund. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.


2. CAPITAL STOCK

On October 18, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
implement an open-market share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may
purchase, from time to time, up to 5.4 million shares of the Fund's common stock
in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management (approximately 10%
of the shares outstanding at the time the program was initially implemented). In
May 2000, the Board of Directors removed the 10% limitation on share repurchases
in order to give management greater flexibility to engage in an aggressive share
repurchase program. Effective May 10, 2002, the Board of Directors discontinued
the repurchase program.

At June 30, 2003, there were 100 million shares authorized ($.01 par value).

2. CAPITAL STOCK (CONT.)

On July 11, 2002 and May 22, 2003, the Fund purchased and retired certain
amounts of its outstanding common stock. The Fund incurred tender costs, which
were charged to additional paid-in-capital. Tender offer transactions were as
follows:

                                         MAY 22, 2003*      JULY 11, 2002

Shares repurchased and retired .........   6,656,425           4,364,926
Purchase price .........................       $9.97               $9.45
Percentage of net asset value ..........       92.5%                 90%
Tender costs incurred ..................    $198,768            $242,221
*See Note 8 regarding Recent Litigation


3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers or directors of Templeton Asset
Management Ltd. (TAML) and Franklin Templeton Services, LLC (FT Services), the
Fund's investment manager and administrative manager, respectively.

The Fund pays an investment management fee to TAML of 1.25% per year of the
average weekly net assets of the Fund. The Fund pays FT Services an
administrative fee of 0.15% per year of the Fund's average weekly net assets, of
which 0.10% is paid to Nomura Asset Management, Inc.


4. INCOME TAXES

At June 30, 2003, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments .....................................    $400,183,135
                                                            --------------
Unrealized appreciation .................................      86,222,591
Unrealized depreciation .................................     (48,956,734)
                                                            --------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ..............    $ 37,265,857
                                                            ==============

Net investment income and net realized gains differ for financial statement and
tax purposes primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales and foreign
currency transactions.

At December 31, 2002, the Fund had tax basis capital losses which may be carried
over to offset future capital gains. Such losses expire as follows:

                 Capital loss carryovers expiring in:
                  2006 .................................    $   992,610
                  2007 .................................     49,694,430
                  2009 .................................     47,221,414
                                                            ------------
                                                            $97,908,454

8. RECENT LITIGATION

On January 29, 2003, the Fund, together with Templeton China World Fund, Inc.
("China Fund"), another closed-end management investment company in Franklin
Templeton Investments, and TAML, the investment adviser to the Fund and China
Fund, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, Northern Division, against Harvard College, Harvard Management
Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor to Harvard
College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management (referred to
collectively as "Harvard"). The complaint alleged that Harvard violated several
provisions of the Federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC related to
Harvard's ownership of Fund shares and actions as a shareholder. On February 7,
2003, Harvard counterclaimed, alleging that the Fund, China Fund, TAML and each
fund's directors violated certain provisions of the Federal securities laws and
SEC rules. Harvard also asserted counterclaims of breach of fiduciary duty under
Maryland state law against TAML and each fund's directors. On March 20, 2003,
the parties announced a settlement that resulted in, among other things, the
dismissal of their litigation claims against each other and the withdrawal of
shareholder proposals submitted by Harvard College for the Fund's 2003 Annual
Shareholders' Meeting (the "Meeting").

DISMISSAL OF LAWSUIT. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Fund and
Harvard, the complaint brought by the Fund, China Fund and TAML against Harvard,
as well as the counterclaims brought by Harvard against the Fund, China Fund,
each fund's directors and TAML were dismissed without prejudice. The parties
have also entered into covenants not to sue each other with respect to the
claims that were made or could have been made in the litigation absent a breach
of the settlement agreements.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. As part of the settlement, Harvard College has agreed to
withdraw all of its shareholder proposals for the Meeting.

TENDER OFFERS. The Fund announced that as part of its settlement with Harvard,
it has agreed to take, and the Board approved, the following actions:

o  APRIL 2003 CASH TENDER OFFER--The Fund agreed to commence a cash tender
   offer, which was required to be commenced on or prior to April 30, 2003, for
   15% of the Fund's outstanding shares at 92.5% of net asset value per share as
   of the date the offer expires. Previously, the Board had approved an April
   2003 cash tender offer for not less than 10% of the Fund's outstanding shares
   at not less than 90% of net asset value per share. On April 24, 2003, the
   Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 6,656,425 shares, or 15%, of the
   Fund's outstanding shares at a price per share equal to 92.5% of net asset
   value per share as of May 22, 2003, the expiration date of the tender offer.
   In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, 6,656,425 shares were
   accepted by the Fund for a purchase price of $9.97 per share.

o  IN-KIND TENDER OFFERS--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an exemptive order
   allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic tender offers, each for up
   to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 95% of net asset
   value per share as of the date the offer expires, to be paid entirely in kind
   through a pro rata distribution of marketable portfolio securities and
   available cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement requires the
   Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's shares
   within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The Fund may also be
   required under the settlement to conduct, on substantially identical terms,
   up to two additional in-kind tender offers under certain circumstances. There
   is no assurance that the SEC will issue the exemptive order, nor is it
   possible to predict the date when an exemptive order might be granted.

   for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the settlement provides that the
   Fund may, but is not obligated to, conduct an additional cash tender offer,
   and possibly later follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the Fund's
   outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share as of the
   date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if the Fund does not
   conduct these tender offers, Harvard will be relieved of its obligation to
   refrain from making shareholder proposals and taking other actions with
   respect to the Fund.

Harvard announced that it intends to tender all of the shares it then owns into
each tender offer described above that is commenced.

The Settlement Agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, nor to encourage others to
do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any time to
acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or similar
investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Fund agreed that TAML shall be responsible for the
legal fees and expenses incurred by the Fund and its directors with respect to
the Settlement Agreement and the litigation. The Fund agreed that TAML shall
also be responsible for the legal fees and expenses incurred by the Fund through
March 20, 2003, with respect to its proxy contest relating to the Meeting.

TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.
Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Securities Trust Company (the "Plan Agent") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Agent must receive
written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Agent, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per month, for
the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments shall be made
by check or money order payable to "Mellon Securities Trust Company" and sent to
Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attn:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Agent shall apply such payments (less a
$5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to purchases of
the Fund's shares in the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Agent sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Agent; or, if the participant wishes, the Plan
Agent will sell the participant's shares and send the proceeds, less a service
charge of $5.00 and less trading fees.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that

information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant's management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The

effective.
