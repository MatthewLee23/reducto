Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the annual reporting period
ended October 31, 2006. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under the New
York Stock Exchange symbol "AFB".

Investment Objective and Policies

The Fund is a closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide
high current income exempt from regular federal income tax by investing
substantially all of its net assets in municipal securities that pay interest
that is exempt from federal income tax. The Fund will normally invest at least
80% of its net assets in municipal securities paying interest that is exempt
from regular federal income tax. The Fund also normally will invest at least
75% of its assets in investment-grade municipal securities or unrated municipal
securities considered to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to
25% of its net assets in municipal bonds rated below investment grade and
unrated municipal bonds considered to be of comparable quality as determined by
the Fund's investment adviser. The Fund intends to invest primarily in
municipal securities that pay interest that is not subject to the federal
Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"), but may invest without limit in municipal
securities paying interest that is subject to the federal AMT. For more
information regarding the Fund's risks, please see "A Word About Risk" on page
3 and "Note G-Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to
Financial Statements on page 27.

Investment Results

The table on page 4 provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended October 31, 2006.

The Fund outperformed its benchmark during both the six- and 12-month reporting
periods ended October 31, 2006. The Fund's stronger relative performance during
the 12-month period under review was largely the result of security selection
in the pre-refunded, insured and special tax sectors. In addition, the Fund's
leveraged structure slightly aided its performance.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

The U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed") raised the target for the Fed funds rate
six times over the past 12 months and thereby increased it by 1.50% to the
current level of 5.25%. This caused short-term municipal rates to rise. For
instance, since October 31, 2005, one-year municipal bond yields have risen
0.48%. Over the same time period, 20-year municipal bond yields declined by
0.41%. As a result of this rate movement, the difference between municipal
short-and long-term rates is less than it has been in 30 years. In other words,
the municipal yield curve is flatter than it has been in 30 years. U.S.
Treasury bond yields rose more than comparable maturity municipal bond yields,
as one-year U.S. Treasury rates rose 0.77% and 20-year U.S. Treasury yields
rose by 0.19%. As a result of the relative movement, the municipal market
outperformed the U.S. Treasury


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 1


market; the LB Municipal Index return for the 12-month period was 5.75% versus
4.43% for the LB U.S. Treasury Index. Most of the return for the municipal
market was due to its return of 4.05% during the past four months after the Fed
signaled that it had stopped raising short-term rates.

Over the 12-month reporting period, municipal bonds issued by lower-credit
quality borrowers continued to outperform bonds issued by high-grade borrowers.
The LB Municipal Non-Investment Grade (High Yield) Index returned 11.87% versus
the 5.75% return for the LB Municipal Index, which represents the overall
investment-grade market. The result of this outperformance has been that the
incremental yield, or credit spread, investors earn by owning lower-rated bonds
is extremely low by historic standards. The performance of the high yield
municipal market has benefited from the strong demand from individual
investors. Investor flows into high yield municipal bond funds continue to
represent about 40% of all municipal bond flows. Despite the fact that the high
yield municipal market only represents about 4% of the overall municipal
market, the assets in high yield municipal funds now represent over 20% of the
assets in all municipal funds.

With the municipal yield curve flat, and credit spreads low, investors
generally are being rewarded less than the market has historically offered for
taking risk. Accordingly, the Fund's Municipal Bond Investment Team (the
"team") has sought opportunities to raise the overall credit quality of the
Fund and to diversify the Fund's exposure to individual issuers. In addition,
where possible, the team has focused new purchases on bonds maturing in 10-15
years, rather than longer maturity bonds. Both of these strategies should be
beneficial to the Fund's performance if the market returns to more typical
relationships.

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE


An Important Note About the Value of Historical Performance

The performance on the following page represents past performance and does not
guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance information shown. All fees and expenses related to the operation
of the Fund have been deducted. Performance assumes reinvestment of
distributions and does not account for taxes.

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund Shareholder Information

The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "AFB." Weekly comparative net asset value
(NAV) and market price information about the Fund is published each Monday in
The Wall Street Journal, each Sunday in The New York Times and each Saturday in
Barron's and other newspapers in a table called "Closed-End Bond Funds." For
additional shareholder information regarding this Fund, please see page 44.

Benchmark Disclosure

The unmanaged Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a fund portfolio. The Index
is a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment grade,
tax-exempt bond market. An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and its
results are not indicative of the performance for any specific investment,
including the Fund.

A Word About Risk

Among the risks of investing in the Fund are changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Changes in interest
rates have a greater effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with
shorter maturities. Please note, as interest rates rise, existing bond prices
fall and can cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline. While
the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in
order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments.  At the discretion
of the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds that are rated below investment grade (i.e., "junk bonds").
These securities involve greater volatility and risk than higher-quality
fixed-income securities.

Leverage Risk - The Fund may use certain investment techniques that have
increased risks. For example, the issuance of the Fund's preferred stock
results in leveraging of the Common Stock, an investment technique usually
considered speculative. The Fund utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the
yield and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot
be achieved in all interest rate environments. Leverage creates certain risks
for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both the net asset
value and market value of the Common Stock, and fluctuations in the dividend
rates on the Preferred Stock will affect the return to holders of Common Stock.
To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and
if short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends
paid on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income
available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset
value of the Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock
Exchange) may, as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates
rise, the Common Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the
price of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred
Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the
market value of the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 21


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
October 31, 2006


NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange (other than securities listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market,
Inc. ("NASDAQ")) or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities listed only on NASDAQ are valued in
accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call options
are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that day, such
securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open futures
contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement price or,
in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are
no quotations available for the day of valuation, the last available closing
settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter market,
("OTC") are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices as reported
by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable sources; U.S. government
securities and other debt instruments having 60 days or less remaining until
maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or
less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if
their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities,
including mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued on the
basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one
or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are
obtained, AllianceBernstein L.P. (prior to February 24, 2006 known as Alliance
Capital Management L.P.) (the "Adviser") may establish procedures


22 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a daily
basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other
derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a
major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To
the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification.


NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily and paid monthly. The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion
of its fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the
Fund's average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders
for the first 5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's
average daily net


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 23


assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in year 6, 0.15% in year
7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the year ended October 31, 2006,
which is year 5 of operations, the amount of such fees waived was $1,274,940.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with
AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc. (prior to February 24, 2006 known as
Alliance Global Investor Services, Inc.) ("ABIS"), an affiliate of the Adviser,
the Fund reimburses ABIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for
the Fund.During the year ended October 31, 2006, there was no reimbursement
paid to ABIS.


NOTE C
Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the year ended October 31, 2006, were as follows:

                                              Purchases            Sales
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment securities (excluding
  U.S. government securities)              $ 41,724,566        $ 36,982,170
U.S. government securities                           -0-                 -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes, gross unrealized
appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap transactions) are as
follows:

Cost                                                          $ 481,976,025
Gross unrealized appreciation                                 $  30,581,314
Gross unrealized depreciation                                       (31,116)
Net unrealized appreciation                                   $  30,550,198

1. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the
contract. Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each
counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.
Additionally, risks may arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or
in the value of the underlying securities.

As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting


24 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


Standards Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments on
swap contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss
recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of operations.
Prior to November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within
interest income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the
value of swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

2. Financial Futures Contracts

The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts for the purpose of hedging
the portfolio against adverse effects of anticipated movements in the market.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of these
financial instruments and the imperfect correlation between movements in the
price of the futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities
hedged or used for cover.

At the time the Fund enters into a futures contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral an initial margin with the broker, as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are
known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
losses. Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to
meet the terms of the contract. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract
at the time it was opened and the time it was closed.


NOTE D
Common Stock

There are 20,514,801 shares of common stock outstanding at October 31, 2006.
During the year ended October 31, 2006, the Fund issued 43,134 shares in
connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. During the year ended
October 31, 2005, the Fund did not issue any shares in connection with the
Fund's reinvestment plan.


NOTE E
Preferred Stock

The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction
Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series M, T, W and TH. The dividend rate on the Series M is 3.50% effective
through November 6, 2006. The dividend rate on the Series T is 3.55%


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 25


effective through November 7, 2006. The dividend rate on the Series W is 3.50%
effective through November 1, 2006. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 3.60%
effective through November 2, 2006.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.


NOTE F
Distributions To Common Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid to common shareholders during the
fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 were as follows:

                                                2006                2005
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income                          $     33,460        $     42,667
  Tax exempt income                          20,374,316          20,347,113
Total distributions paid                   $ 20,407,776        $ 20,389,780

As of October 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                                $    101,375
Accumulated capital and other losses                             (1,116,788)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                           29,844,434(b)
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                           $ 28,829,021(c)

(a)  On October 31, 2006, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$1,116,788 of which $1,106,582 expires in the year 2011, and $10,206 expires in
the year 2012. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed. During the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $337,555.

(b)  The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributed primarily to the difference between
the book and tax treatment of swap income.

(c)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis components of accumulated
earnings/(deficit) is attributable primarily to dividends payable.


26 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


During the current fiscal year, permanent differences primarily due to the tax
treatment of swap income resulted in a net decrease in undistributed net
investment income, and a net decrease in accumulated net realized loss on
investment transactions. This reclassification had no effect on net assets.


NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Leverage Risk--The Fund may use certain investment techniques that have
increased risks. For example, the issuance of the Fund's preferred stock
results in leveraging of the Common Stock, an investment technique usually
considered speculative. The Fund utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the
yield and net asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot
be achieved in all interest rate environments. Leverage creates certain risks
for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both the net asset
value and market value of the Common Stock and fluctuations in the dividend
rates on the Preferred Stock will affect the return to holders of Common Stock.
To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock, which pays dividends at
prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the proceeds in long-term
municipal bonds. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and
if short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends
paid on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income
available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset
value of the Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock
Exchange) may, as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates
rise, the Common Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the
price of the portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred
Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the
market value of the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland (the "Mutual Fund MDL").
Management of the Adviser believes that these private lawsuits are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuation dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAG Order"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

(i)    The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the "Reimbursement
Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse effects of market
timing attributable to market timing relationships described in the SEC Order.
According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of
priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered
by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;


28 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


(ii)   The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some of
the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January 1,
2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii)  The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and compliance
procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the Adviser's
registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will introduce
governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

On February 10, 2004, the Adviser received (i) a subpoena duces tecum from the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia and (ii) a request
for information from West Virginia's Office of the State Auditor, Securities
Commission (the "West Virginia Securities Commissioner") (together, the
"Information Requests"). Both Information Requests require the Adviser to
produce documents concerning, among other things, any market timing or late
trading in the Adviser's sponsored mutual funds. The Adviser responded to the
Information Requests and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

On April 11, 2005, a complaint entitled The Attorney General of the State of
West Virginia v. AIM Advisors, Inc., et al. ("WVAG Complaint") was filed
against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. ("Alliance
Holding"), and various other defendants not affiliated with the Adviser. The
WVAG Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia
by the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia. The WVAG Complaint makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in certain of the complaints
related to the lawsuits discussed above. On October 19, 2005, the WVAG
Complaint was transferred to the Mutual Fund MDL.

On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner signed a Summary
Order to Cease and Desist, and Notice of Right to Hearing addressed to the
Adviser and Alliance Holding. The Summary Order claims that the Adviser and
Alliance Holding violated the West Virginia Uniform Securities Act, and makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in the SEC Order and the NYAG
Order. On January 26, 2006, the Adviser, Alliance Holding, and various
unaffiliated defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Order
Suspending Proceedings in West Virginia state court seeking to vacate the
Summary Order and for other relief. The court denied the writ and in September


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 29


2006 the Supreme Court of Appeals declined the defendants' petition for appeal.
On September 22, 2006, Alliance and Alliance Holding filed an answer and motion
to dismiss the Summary Order with the Securities Commissioner.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Fund was not named as a defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The
Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by alleged shareholders of an AllianceBernstein mutual
fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things, (i) that certain of the
defendants improperly authorized the payment of excessive commissions and other
fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in exchange for preferential marketing
services, (ii) that certain of the defendants misrepresented and omitted from
registration statements and other reports material facts concerning such
payments, and (iii) that certain defendants caused such conduct as control
persons of other defendants. The Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation
of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206
and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding
and abetting breaches of common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of
their contracts with the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the
Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees,
commissions and soft dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or
discriminatorily obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, nine additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants. All nine of the lawsuits (i) were brought
as class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, (ii) assert claims substantially identical to the Aucoin
Complaint, and (iii) are brought on behalf of shareholders of the Funds.

On February 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action
complaint ("Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint") that asserts claims
substantially similar to the Aucoin Complaint and the nine additional lawsuits
referenced above. On October 19, 2005, the District Court dismissed each of the
claims set forth in the Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint, except for
plaintiffs' claim under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. On January
11, 2006, the District Court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and
dismissed the remaining Section 36(b) claim. On May 31, 2006 the District


30 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


Court denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On July
5, 2006, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On October 4, 2006 the appeal was
withdrawn by stipulation, with plaintiffs reserving the right to reinstate it
at a later date.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.


NOTE I
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
would be recorded in the current period. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
tax years as of the effective date. At this time, management is evaluating the
implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial statements has not yet
been determined.

On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 establishes an
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. The
application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time,
management is evaluating the implications of FAS 157 and its impact on the
financial statements has not yet been determined.

32 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


(a)  As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however, prior to
November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. For the year ended October 31,
2004, the effect of this change to the net investment income and the net
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions was less than
$0.01 per share and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets
was .00%.

(b)  Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(e)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(f)  These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(g)  Annualized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the
portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2006, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets
applicable to common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2006 by correspondence with
the custodian and others, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from others were not received. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. at October 31, 2006, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets
applicable to common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

TAX INFORMATION (unaudited)

In accordance with Federal tax law, the Fund's designation of "exempt interest
dividends" paid during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 was $26,825,664.

For foreign shareholders, the Fund designates 100% of its ordinary dividends as
qualified interest income.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(unaudited)

Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names can elect to
participate in the Dividend Reinvest-ment Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which
dividends and capital gain distributions to shareholders will be paid in or
reinvested in additional shares of the Fund (the "Dividend Shares"). Equiserve
Trust Company NA, (the "Agent") will act as agent for participants under the
Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of broker or nominee
should contact such broker or nominee to determine whether or how they may
participate in the Plan.

If the Board declares an income distribution or determines to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares or in cash,  non-participants in the
Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent
in shares of Common Stock of the Fund valued as follows:

(i)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current market
price.

(ii)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
value at the time of valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
distribution in cash and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of
Common Stock in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after
the payment date for such dividend or distribution and in no event more than 30
days after such date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
purchase is necessary to comply with Federal securities laws. If, before the
Plan agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset
value of a share of Common Stock, the average purchase price per share paid by
the Plan agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares of Common
Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or
distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of
the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income taxes that may be payable (or required to be
withheld) on dividends and distributions.


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 35


Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to participants in the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan may
also be amended or terminated by the Agent on at least 90 days' written notice
to participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Agent at Equiserve Trust Company N.A. c/o Alliance National
Municipal Income fund, P.O. Box 43011, Providence, RI 02940-3011.

Since the filing of the most recent amendment to the Fund's registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there have been (i) no
material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies, (ii) no
changes to the Fund's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change
of control of the Fund, (iii) no material changes in the principal risk factors
associated with investment in the Fund, and (iv) no change to the persons
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio,
who are David Dowden, and Terrance Hults, each of whom is a Vice President of
the Fund.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Statement of Policies and Procedures for
Proxy Voting

October 2006

1.  Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, AllianceBernstein L.P.
("AllianceBernstein", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the
best interests of our clients.  We recognize that this duty requires us to vote
client securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the
best interests of our clients.  Consistent with these obligations, we will
disclose our clients' voting records only to them and as required by mutual
fund vote disclosure regulations.  In addition, the proxy committees may, after
careful consideration, choose to respond to surveys regarding past votes.

This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.  It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting
proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  This statement
applies to AllianceBernstein's growth, value and blend investment groups
investing on behalf of clients in both US and non-US securities.

2.  Proxy Policies

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of proxy voting
subjects that can have a significant effect on the investment value of the
securities held in our clients' accounts.  These policies are not exhaustive
due to the variety of proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider.
AllianceBernstein reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order
to avoid voting decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best
interests.  In reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general
policies:

2.1  Corporate Governance

AllianceBernstein's proxy voting policies recognize the importance of good
corporate governance in ensuring that management and the board of directors
fulfill their obligations to the shareholders.  We favor proposals promoting
transparency and accountability within a company.  We will vote for proposals
providing for equal access to the proxy materials so that shareholders can
express their views on various proxy issues.  We also support the appointment
of a majority of independent directors on key committees and separating the
positions of chairman and chief executive officer.  Finally, because we believe
that good corporate governance requires shareholders to have a meaningful voice
in the affairs of the company, we will support shareholder proposals that
request that companies amend their by-laws to provide that director nominees be
elected by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast.

2.2 Elections of Directors

Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or we determine that there
are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for directors, we will vote
in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.  That said, we believe
that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder actions that have received
significant shareholder support.  We may withhold votes for directors (or vote
against in non-US markets) that fail to act on key issues such as failure to
implement proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote or failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their
shares.  In addition, we will withhold votes for directors who fail to attend
at least seventy-five percent of board meetings within a given year without a
reasonable excuse.  Finally, we may abstain or vote against directors of
non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees
disclosed in the proxy statement.

2.3 Appointment of Auditors

AllianceBernstein believes that the company remains in the best position to
choose the auditors and will generally support management's recommendation.
However, we recognize that there may be inherent conflicts when a company's
independent auditor performs substantial non-audit related services for the
company.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibited certain categories of
services by auditors to US issuers, making this issue less prevalent in the US.
Nevertheless, in reviewing a proposed auditor, we will consider the fees paid
for non-audit services relative to total fees as well as if there are other
reasons to question the independence of the auditors.

2.4 Changes in Legal and Capital Structure

Changes in a company's charter, articles of incorporation or by-laws are often
technical and administrative in nature.  Absent a compelling reason to the
contrary, AllianceBernstein will cast its votes in accordance with the
company's management on such proposals.  However, we will review and analyze on
a case-by-case basis any non-routine proposals that are likely to affect the
structure and operation of the company or have a material economic effect on
the company.  For example, we will generally support proposals to increase
authorized common stock when it is necessary to implement a stock split, aid in
a restructuring or acquisition or provide a sufficient number of shares for an
employee savings plan, stock option or executive compensation plan.  However, a
satisfactory explanation of a company's intentions must be disclosed in the
proxy statement for proposals requesting an increase of greater than one
hundred percent of the shares outstanding.  We will oppose increases in
authorized common stock where there is evidence that the shares will be used to
implement a poison pill or another form of anti-takeover device.  We will
support shareholder proposals that seek to eliminate dual class voting
structures.

2.5 Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions

AllianceBernstein believes proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations
are an extension of the investment decision.  Accordingly, we will analyze such
proposals on a case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of our research
analysts that cover the company and our investment professionals managing the
portfolios in which the stock is held.

2.6 Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights

AllianceBernstein believes that certain fundamental rights of shareholders must
be protected.  We will generally vote in favor of proposals that give
shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the company and oppose any
measure that seeks to limit those rights.  However, when analyzing such
proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal against the
impairment of shareholder rights.

2.7 Anti-Takeover Measures

AllianceBernstein believes that measures that impede corporate transactions
such as takeovers or entrench management not only infringe on the rights of
shareholders but may also have a detrimental effect on the value of the
company.  We will generally oppose proposals, regardless of whether they are
advanced by management or shareholders, the purpose or effect of which is to
entrench management or excessively or inappropriately dilute shareholder
ownership.  Conversely, we support proposals that would restrict or otherwise
eliminate anti-takeover or anti-shareholder measures that have already been
adopted by corporate issuers.  For example, we will support shareholder
proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder rights plan
to a shareholder vote.  We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
completely redeem or eliminate such plans.  Furthermore, we will generally
oppose proposals put forward by management (including the authorization of
blank check preferred stock, classified boards and supermajority vote
requirements) that appear to be anti-shareholder or intended as management
entrenchment mechanisms.

2.8 Executive Compensation

AllianceBernstein believes that company management and the compensation
committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be given latitude to
determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit awards offered to
company employees.  Whether proposed by a shareholder or management, we will
review proposals relating to executive compensation plans on a case-by-case
basis to ensure that the long-term interests of management and shareholders are
properly aligned.  In general, we will analyze the proposed plan to ensure that
shareholder equity will not be excessively diluted taking into account shares
available for grant under the proposed plan as well as other existing plans.
We generally will oppose plans that have below market value grant or exercise
prices on the date of issuance or permit repricing of underwater stock options
without shareholder approval.  Other factors such as the company's performance
and industry practice will generally be factored into our analysis.  We
generally will support shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director compensation.  This policy includes proposals that seek
to specify the measurement of performance based compensation.  In addition, we
will support proposals requiring managements to submit severance packages that
exceed 2.99 times the sum of an executive officer's base salary plus bonus that
are triggered by a change in control to a shareholder vote.  Finally, we will
support shareholder proposals requiring companies to expense stock options
because we view them as a large corporate expense that should be appropriately
accounted for.

2.9 Social and Corporate Responsibility

AllianceBernstein will review and analyze on a case-by-case basis proposals
relating to social, political and environmental issues to determine whether
they will have a financial impact on shareholder value.  We will vote against
proposals that are unduly burdensome or result in unnecessary and excessive
costs to the company.  We may abstain from voting on social proposals that do
not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value.

3. Proxy Voting Procedures

3.1 Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for AllianceBernstein and
consider specific proxy voting matters as necessary.  These committees
periodically review these policies and new types of corporate governance
issues, and decide how we should vote on proposals not covered by these
policies. When a proxy vote cannot be clearly decided by an application of our
stated policy, the proxy committee will evaluate the proposal.  In addition,
the committees, in conjunction with the analyst that covers the company, may
contact corporate management and interested shareholder groups and others as
necessary to discuss proxy issues.  Members of the committee include senior
investment personnel and representatives of the Legal and Compliance
Department.  The committees may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential
conflict of interest (as discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor
adherence to these policies.

3.2 Conflicts of Interest

AllianceBernstein recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxy solicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage, or
we administer, who distributes AllianceBernstein sponsored mutual funds, or
with whom we or an employee has another business or personal relationship that
may affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy.  Similarly, AllianceBernstein may
have a potential material conflict of interest when deciding how to vote on a
proposal sponsored or supported by a shareholder group that is a client.  We
believe that centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy
voting committees and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are
voted with only our clients' best interests in mind.  Additionally, we have
implemented procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a
material conflict of interests, including: (i) on an annual basis, the proxy
committees will take reasonable steps to evaluate the nature of
AllianceBernstein's and our employees' material business and personal
relationships (and those of our affiliates) with any company whose equity
securities are held in client accounts and any client that has sponsored or has
material interest in a proposal upon which we will be eligible to vote;  (ii)
requiring anyone involved in the decision making process to disclose to the
chairman of the appropriate proxy committee any potential conflict that they
are aware of (including personal relationships) and any contact that they have
had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote;  (iii) prohibiting
employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration from
revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted
influence from interested parties;  and (iv) where a material conflict of
interests exists, reviewing our proposed vote by applying a series of objective
tests and, where necessary, considering the views of third party research
services to ensure that our voting decision is consistent with our clients'
best interests.
Because under certain circumstances AllianceBernstein considers the
recommendation of third party research services, the proxy committees will take
reasonable steps to verify that any third party research service is in fact
independent based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.  This
includes reviewing the third party research service's conflict management
procedures and ascertaining, among other things, whether the third party
research service (i) has the capacity and competency to adequately analyze
proxy issues; and (ii) can make such recommendations in an impartial manner and
in the best interests of our clients.

3.3 Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking."  Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting with a designated depositary.  During this blocking period,
shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until the meeting has
taken place and the shares are returned to the clients' custodian banks.
Absent compelling reasons to the contrary, AllianceBernstein believes that the
benefit to the client of exercising the vote does not outweigh the cost of
voting (i.e. not being able to sell the shares during this period).
Accordingly, if share blocking is required we generally abstain from voting
those shares.
In addition, voting proxies of issuers in non-US markets may give rise to a
number of administrative issues that may prevent AllianceBernstein from voting
such proxies.  For example, AllianceBernstein may receive meeting notices
without enough time to fully consider the proxy or after the cut-off date for
voting.  Other markets require AllianceBernstein to provide local agents with
power of attorney prior to implementing AllianceBernstein's voting
instructions.  Although it is AllianceBernstein's policy to seek to vote all
proxies for securities held in client accounts for which we have proxy voting
authority, in the case of non-US issuers, we vote proxies on a best efforts
basis.

3.4 Loanned Securities

Many clients of AllianceBernstein have entered into securities lending
arrangements with agent lenders to generate additional revenue.
AllianceBernstein will not be able to vote securities that are on loan under
these types of arrangements.  However, under rare circumstances, for voting
issues that may have a significant impact on the investment, we may request
that clients recall securities that are on loan if we determine that the
benefit of voting outweighs the costs and lost revenue to the client or fund
and the administrative burden of retrieving the securities.

Investment Professional Conflict of Interest Disclosure

As an investment adviser and fiduciary, Alliance owes its clients and
shareholders an undivided duty of loyalty.  We recognize that conflicts of
interest are inherent in our business and accordingly have developed policies
and procedures (including oversight monitoring) reasonably designed to detect,
manage and mitigate the effects of actual or potential conflicts of interest in
the area of employee personal trading, managing multiple accounts for multiple
clients, including AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and allocating investment
opportunities.  Investment professionals, including portfolio managers and
research analysts, are subject to the above-mentioned policies and oversight
monitoring to ensure that all clients are treated equitably.  We place the
interests of our clients first and expect all of our employees to meet their
fiduciary duties.

Employee Personal Trading.  Alliance has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics that is designed to detect and prevent conflicts of interest when
investment professionals and other personnel of Alliance own, buy or sell
securities which may be owned by, or bought or sold for, clients. Personal
securities transactions by an employee may raise a potential conflict of
interest when an employee owns or trades in a security that is owned or
considered for purchase or sale by a client, or recommended for purchase or
sale by an employee to a client. Subject to the reporting requirements and
other limitations of its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Alliance permits
its employees to engage in personal securities transactions, and also allows
them to acquire investments in the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds through
direct purchase, 401K/profit sharing plan investment and/or notionally in
connection with deferred incentive compensation awards. Alliance's Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct requires disclosure of all personal accounts and
maintenance of brokerage accounts with designated broker-dealers approved by
Alliance.  The Code also requires preclearance of all securities transactions
and imposes a one-year holding period for securities purchased by employees to
discourage short-term trading.

Managing Multiple Accounts for Multiple Clients.  Alliance has compliance
policies and oversight monitoring in place to address conflicts of interest
relating to the management of multiple accounts for multiple clients.
Conflicts of interest may arise when an investment professional has
responsibilities for the investments of more than one account because the
investment professional may be unable to devote equal time and attention to
each account.  The investment professional or investment professional teams for
each client may have responsibilities for managing all or a portion of the
investments of multiple accounts with a common investment strategy, including
other registered investment companies, unregistered investment vehicles, such
as hedge funds, pension plans, separate accounts, collective trusts and
charitable foundations.  Among other things, Alliance's policies and procedures
provide for the prompt dissemination to investment professionals of initial or
changed investment recommendations by analysts so that investment professionals
are better able to develop investment strategies for all accounts they manage.
In addition, investment decisions by investment professionals are reviewed for
the purpose of maintaining uniformity among similar accounts and ensuring that
accounts are treated equitably.  No investment professional that manages client
accounts carrying performance fees is compensated directly or specifically for
the performance of those accounts.  Investment professional compensation
reflects a broad contribution in multiple dimensions to long-term investment
success for our clients and is not tied specifically to the performance of any
particular client's account, nor is it directly tied to the level or change in
level of assets under management.

Allocating Investment Opportunities.  Alliance has policies and procedures
intended to address conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of
investment opportunities.  These policies and procedures are designed to ensure
that information relevant to investment decisions is disseminated promptly
within its portfolio management teams and investment opportunities are
allocated equitably among different clients. The investment professionals at
Alliance routinely are required to select and allocate investment opportunities
among accounts.  Portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector
exposures tend to be similar across similar accounts, which minimizes the
potential for conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of investment
opportunities.  Nevertheless, investment opportunities may be allocated
differently among accounts due to the particular characteristics of an account,
such as size of the account, cash position, tax status, risk tolerance and
investment restrictions or for other reasons.

Alliance's procedures are also designed to prevent potential conflicts of
interest that may arise when Alliance has a particular financial incentive,
such as a performance-based management fee, relating to an account.  An
investment professional may perceive that he or she has an incentive to devote
more time to developing and analyzing investment strategies and opportunities
or allocating securities preferentially to accounts for which Alliance could
share in investment gains.

To address these conflicts of interest, Alliance's policies and procedures
require, among other things, the prompt dissemination to investment
professionals of any initial or changed investment recommendations by analysts;
the aggregation of orders to facilitate best execution for all accounts; price
averaging for all aggregated orders; objective allocation for limited
investment opportunities (e.g., on a rotational basis) to ensure fair and
equitable allocation among accounts; and limitations on short sales of
securities.  These procedures also require documentation and review of
justifications for any decisions to make investments only for select accounts
or in a manner disproportionate to the size of the account.

(a) (3) Portfolio Manager Compensation

Alliance's compensation program for investment professionals is designed to be
competitive and effective in order to attract and retain the highest caliber
employees. The compensation program for investment professionals is designed to
reflect their ability to generate long-term investment success for our clients,
including shareholders of the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds.  Investment
professionals do not receive any direct compensation based upon the investment
returns of any individual client account, nor is compensation tied directly to
the level or change in level of assets under management.  Investment
professionals' annual compensation is comprised of the following:

(i) Fixed base salary:  This is generally the smallest portion of compensation.
The base salary is a relatively low, fixed salary within a similar range for
all investment professionals.  The base salary is determined at the outset of
employment based on level of experience, does not change significantly from
year-to-year and hence, is not particularly sensitive to performance.

(ii) Discretionary incentive compensation in the form of an annual cash bonus:
Alliance's overall profitability determines the total amount of incentive
compensation available to investment professionals. This portion of
compensation is determined subjectively based on qualitative and quantitative
factors.  In evaluating this component of an investment professional's
compensation, Alliance considers the contribution to his/her team or discipline
as it relates to that team's overall contribution to the long-term investment
success, business results and strategy of Alliance.  Quantitative factors
considered include, among other things, relative investment performance (e.g.,
by comparison to competitor or peer group funds or similar styles of
investments, and appropriate, broad-based or specific market indices), and
consistency of performance.  There are no specific formulas used to determine
this part of an investment professional's compensation and the compensation is
not tied to any pre-determined or specified level of performance.  Alliance
also considers qualitative factors such as the complexity and risk of
investment strategies involved in the style or type of assets managed by the
investment professional; success of marketing/business development efforts and
client servicing; seniority/length of service with the firm; management and
supervisory responsibilities; and fulfillment of Alliance's leadership criteria.

(iii) Discretionary incentive compensation in the form of awards under
Alliance's Partners Compensation Plan ("deferred awards"): Alliance's overall
profitability determines the total amount of deferred awards available to
investment professionals.  The deferred awards are allocated among investment
professionals based on criteria similar to those used to determine the annual
cash bonus.  There is no fixed formula for determining these amounts.  Deferred
awards, for which there are various investment options, vest over a four-year
period and are generally forfeited if the employee resigns or Alliance
terminates his/her employment.  Investment options under the deferred awards
plan include many of the same AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds offered to mutual
fund investors, thereby creating a close alignment between the financial
interests of the investment professionals and those of Alliance's clients and
mutual fund shareholders with respect to the performance of those mutual funds.
Alliance also permits deferred award recipients to allocate up to 50% of their
award to investments in Alliance's publicly traded equity securities.(1)

(iv) Contributions under Alliance's Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan:  The
contributions are based on Alliance's overall profitability.  The amount and
allocation of the contributions are determined at the sole discretion of
Alliance.

beneficially by the Fund's portfolio managers as of the Fund's fiscal year

Exhibit 12 (a)(1)

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

The AllianceBernstein Mutual Fund Complex's code of ethics (this "Code") for
the investment companies within the complex (collectively, the "Funds" and
each, a "Company") applies to each Company's Principal Executive Officer,
Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and Controller (the "Covered
Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

* honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;


* full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
Company;

* compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

* the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

* accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts
of Interest

Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
with the Company.  For the purposes of this Code, members of the Covered
Officer's family include his or her spouse, children, stepchildren, financial
dependents, parents and stepparents.

Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The Company's and the
investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit,
conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between
the Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and
the Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser
and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties
as officers of the Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the
provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such
activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
recognized by the Company's Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Directors")
that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more of
the other Funds or of other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of
interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Company.

Each Covered Officer must:


* not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company whereby
the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Company;

* not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of
the Company;

* not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to trade
personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;

There are some conflict of interest situations, whether involving a Covered
Officer directly or a member of his family, that should always be discussed
with the General Counsel of Alliance Capital Management L.P.(the "General
Counsel"), if material. Examples of these include:

* service as a director on the board of directors or trustees of any public or
private company (other than a not-for-profit organization);

* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;

* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Company has
current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with,
any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment adviser,
principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof;

* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio transactions or for
selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered
Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III. Disclosure and Compliance

* Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally applicable to the
Company;

* each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the
Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

* each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and the
adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or
submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds; and

* it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.


IV. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

* upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the General Counsel that he has
received, read, and understands the Code;

* annually thereafter affirm to the General Counsel that he has complied with
the requirements of the Code;

* complete at least annually a questionnaire relating to affiliations or other
relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest;

* not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
Company or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
are made in good faith; and

* notify the General Counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this
Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by a
Covered Officer will be considered by the Company's Audit Committee (the
"Committee").

The Company will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

* the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations reported to him;

* if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no material
violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any further
action;

* any matter that the General Counsel believes is a material violation will be
reported to the Committee;

* if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
inform and make a recommendation to the Directors, who will consider
appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications
to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the
Covered Officer;

* the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

* any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. Other Policies and Procedures

This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Company for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to
registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or
procedures of the Company, the Company's adviser, principal underwriter, or
other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities
of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, it is understood that
this Code is in all respects separate and apart from, and operates
independently of, any such policies and procedures. In particular, the
Company's and its investment adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI. Amendments

Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Directors, including a majority
of independent directors.

VII. Confidentiality

All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Directors, the investment adviser, their
counsel, counsel to the Company and, if deemed appropriate by the Directors of
the Company, to the Directors of the other Funds.

VIII. Internal Use

The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
