             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Directors of
   UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2004, and the related  statements of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes in members'
capital  for each of the two years in the period  then  ended.  These  financial
statements are the responsibility of the Fund's  management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis  for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Fund's internal control over
financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such  opinion.  An audit also
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence  with management of
the investment  funds. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. at December
31,  2004,  the results of its  operations  and its cash flows for the year then
ended and the changes in its  members'  capital for each of the two years in the
period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    ORGANIZATION

      UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was  organized  as a limited  liability
      company  under the laws of  Delaware  on  September  4, 2002.  The Fund is
      registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
      Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management  investment company.
      The Fund's investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the
      long term.  The Fund is a  multi-manager  fund that  seeks to achieve  its
      objective  by  deploying  its  assets  among a select  group of  portfolio
      managers who primarily  employ  long/short  equity  strategies,  including
      those  involving  foreign  issuers.  Generally,  such  portfolio  managers
      conduct their investment  programs through  unregistered  investment funds
      (collectively,  the  "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund invests as a
      limited partner,  member or shareholder  along with other  investors.  The
      Fund commenced operations on February 1, 2003.

      The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall responsibility
      to manage and  control the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
      exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies  regarding  the
      management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
      have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser" and, when
      providing    services   under   the    Administration    Agreement,    the
      "Administrator"),   a  Delaware  limited  liability  company,  to  provide
      investment  advice  regarding the selection of Investment  Funds and to be
      responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

      The Adviser is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
      which is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is  registered  as an
      investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

      Initial and additional  applications  for interests by eligible  investors
      may be  accepted  at such  times  as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
      generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves  the right to reject any
      application for interests in the Fund.

      The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to
      written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such times
      and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
      and  exclusive  discretion.  Members  can only  transfer  or assign  their
      membership  interests  (i) by  operation  of law  pursuant  to the  death,
      bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a  Member,  or (ii)  with the
      written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and
      absolute discretion.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction of the
      Adviser as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
      accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth  below or as may be
      determined  from time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
      Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are subject to the
      terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and


                                                                               6

                                                             UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      offering memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment
      Funds are  carried  at fair  value as  determined  by the  Fund's pro rata
      interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund. All valuations utilize
      financial  information  supplied  by each  Investment  Fund and are net of
      management and  performance  incentive fees or allocations  payable to the
      Investment   Funds'   managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment   Funds'
      agreements.  The  Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  the  Adviser  to
      consider  all relevant  information  available at the time the Fund values
      its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information
      and  consider  whether  it  is  appropriate,  in  light  of  all  relevant
      circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported
      or  whether to adjust  such  value.  The  underlying  investments  of each
      Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair  value as  described  in each
      Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.   (See  Schedule  of  Portfolio
      Investments)

      Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment  Funds,  whether in
      the form of cash or  securities,  are first  applied as a reduction of the
      investment's cost.

      B.    INCOME RECOGNITION

      Interest  income is  recorded  on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
      losses from Investment Fund  transactions are calculated on the identified
      cost basis.

      C.    FUND COSTS

      The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including,  but not
      limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to portfolio
      transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees; accounting
      and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
      value; costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
      costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;  expenses of
      meetings  of   Directors   and   Members;   all  costs  with   respect  to
      communications  to Members;  and other  types of expenses  approved by the
      Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

      D.    INCOME TAXES

      No provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
      been provided, since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
      individually  required  to report on its own tax return  its  distributive
      share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

      The Fund has  reclassified  $7,258,096  and $82,756 from  accumulated  net
      investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from  investments to net
      capital  contributions  during  the year  ended  December  31,  2004.  The
      reclassification   was  to  reflect,  as  an  adjustment  to  net  capital
      contributions,  the  amount  of  taxable  income  or loss  that  have been
      allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on net assets.


                                                                               7

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      E.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

      Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank,  NA
      account that pays money market  rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
      accrued  interest,  which  is  included  in  interest  receivable  on  the
      Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

      From  time to time the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
      connection  with  such  transactions  it is the  Fund's  policy  that  its
      custodian take  possession of the underlying  collateral  securities,  the
      fair  value  of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount  of the  repurchase
      transaction,  including  accrued  interest,  at all  times.  If the seller
      defaults,  and the fair value of the collateral  declines,  realization of
      the  collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December 31,
      2004 there were no open repurchase agreements.

      G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

      The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
      and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates  utilized
      in preparing the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable and prudent;
      however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      The Adviser provides  investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
      an Investment Manager Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund pays
      the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment  Management Fee") at the annual
      rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets  attributable to
      the Adviser and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator  provides  certain
      administrative  services  to the  Fund,  including,  among  other  things,
      providing office space and other support  services.  In consideration  for
      such  services,  the  Fund  pays  the  Administrator  a  monthly  fee (the
      "Administrator  Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Fund's net assets,
      excluding  assets  attributable to the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's
      capital account.  The Administrator Fee and the Investment  Management Fee
      will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the Fund's  assets and  debited
      against the Members' capital accounts,  excluding net assets  attributable
      to the Administrator's and the Adviser's capital account. A portion of the
      Investment  Management Fee and the  Administrator  Fee is paid by UBSFA to
      its affiliates.

      UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
      Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
      compensation  from the Fund, and will bear its own costs  associated  with
      its  activities as placement  agent.  Placement  fees, if any,  charged on
      contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts to arrive at a
      net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute assets of
      the Fund.


                                                                               8

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

      The net increase (or decrease) in Members' capital derived from operations
      (net income or loss) is allocated  to the capital  accounts of all Members
      on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the  Investment  Management  Fee and the
      Administrator Fee which are similarly  allocated to all Members other than
      the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

      In order to achieve a more equitable distribution of the impact of certain
      initial  organization  and offering costs, the Fund has either credited to
      or debited against the Members'  capital  accounts the sum of such initial
      costs based on each individual Member's percentage of capital in the Fund.
      The  reallocation  of these costs will occur for the first  twelve  months
      after the initial closing date of the Fund.

      Each Director who is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined by
      the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each
      meeting  attended.  Any  Director who is an  "interested  person" does not
      receive  any  annual  or other  fee  from  the  Fund.  All  Directors  are
      reimbursed by the Fund for all  reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
      amounts  expensed  by the Fund  related  to  Directors  for the year ended
      December 31, 2004 were $21,457.

4.    ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

      PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
      (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for
      the Fund.

      PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
      Investor Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
      administrative,   accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  Member  related
      services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the
      average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii)
      the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
      sponsored   or  advised  by  UBS   Americas,   Inc.  or  its   affiliates.
      Additionally,  the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred
      by PFPC Inc.

5.    CREDIT FACILITY

      Effective  July 2, 2004 the Fund,  along with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
      entered into a $75,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
      with  Harris  Trust  and  Savings   Bank.   Under  the  most   restrictive
      arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other
      borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's
      borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the portion of the unused line of
      credit at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
      credit to the extent of its own borrowing thereunder. The interest rate on
      the borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points per
      annum. The expiration date of such credit  agreements is July 1, 2005. The
      committed  facility  also  requires a fee to be paid by the Fund, on a pro
      rata basis, based on the amount of the aggregate  commitment which has not
      been  utilized of 25 basis  points per annum.  The Fund had no  borrowings
      outstanding at December 31, 2004.

6.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

      Aggregate  purchases  and sales of  Investment  Funds  for the year  ended
      December 31, 2004 amounted to $203,000,000 and $38,837,880, respectively.

      The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax purposes is adjusted for
      items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds.
      The  allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment
      Funds on Schedules  K-1. The Fund has not yet received all such  Schedules
      K-1 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

7.    INVESTMENTS

      As of December 31, 2004,  the Fund had  investments  in Investment  Funds,
      none of which were related parties.  The Fund's investments are summarized
      below based on the investment  objectives of the specific Investment Funds
      at December 31, 2004.

      INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE                       COST             FAIR VALUE
      --------------------                       ----             ----------

      Long/Short Equity                     $407,244,876         $459,610,926

      The  agreements  related to  investments  in Investment  Funds provide for
      compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of management
      fees of  between  1% and 2% (per  annum)  of net  assets  and  performance
      incentive  fees or  allocations  ranging  from  15% to 20% of net  profits
      earned. The Investment Funds provide for periodic  redemptions,  with lock
      up  provisions  of up to  two  years  from  initial  investment.  Detailed
      information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.    INDEMNIFICATION

      In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts or
      agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future events
      could occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against the
      Fund.  Based on its  history  and  experience,  management  feels that the
      likelihood of such an event is remote.

9.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

      In the normal course of business,  the Investment  Funds in which the Fund
      invests  trade  various  financial  instruments  and  enter  into  various
      investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
      not  limited to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
      contracts for  differences,  and equity swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
      these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these  investments  as
      reported by the Fund.


                                                                              10

</TABLE>

      (a)   Ratio of total  expenses  to average net assets does not include the
            impact of expenses  for  incentive  allocations  or  incentive  fees
            related to the underlying Investment Funds.

      *     Annualized.

      **    Total  return  assumes a purchase  of an interest in the Fund at the
            beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund  interest on the last
            day of the  period  noted  and does not  reflect  the  deduction  of
            placement fees, if any, incurred when subscribing to the Fund. Total
            returns for a period of less than a full year are not annualized. An
            individual  member's ratios and return may vary from the above based
            on the timing of capital transactions.

      ***   The average net assets used in the above  ratios are  calculated  by
            adding any withdrawals payable effective at the end of the period to
            the net assets for such period.

11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

      Effective January 1, 2005, the Fund has redeemed approximately $90,200,000
      in interests  from  Investment  Funds.  Effective  January 12,  2005,  the
      unsecured  revolving line of credit with Harris Trust and Savings Bank was
      increased to a commitment of $150,000,000.

<PAGE>

Audit-Related Fees
- ------------------

    (b)  The  aggregate  fees  billed in each of the last two  fiscal  years for
         assurance  and related  services by the principal  accountant  that are
         reasonably  related to the performance of the audit of the registrant's
         financial  statements and are not reported under  paragraph (a) of this
         Item are  $4,500  for 2003 and  $4,500  for  2004.  Audit-related  fees
         principally  include  fees  associated  with  reviewing  and  providing

    (c)  The  aggregate  fees  billed in each of the last two  fiscal  years for
         professional  services  rendered by the  principal  accountant  for tax
         compliance,  tax  advice,  and tax  planning  are  $61,500 for 2003 and
         $78,000 for 2004. Tax fees include fees for tax compliance services and

         $3,000  for 2003 and  $7,000  for  2004.  Fees for all  other  services
         include fees for administrative  services associated with preparing the
         K-1's for  mailing.  There  were no fees  billed in the last two fiscal
         years  for  services  rendered  by  the  principal  accountant  to  the
         registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser  whose
         role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or
         overseen by another investment  adviser),  and any entity  controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant  ("Service  Affiliates")
         which were required to be pre-approved by the audit committee.

    (e)(1)    The  registrant's  audit  committee   pre-approves  the  principal
              accountant's  engagements for audit and non-audit  services to the
              registrant,  and certain non-audit  services to service Affiliates
              that are required to be  pre-approved,  on a  case-by-case  basis.
              Pre-approval  considerations include whether the proposed services
              are  compatible  with   maintaining  the  principal   accountant's
              independence.


    (e)(2)    There were no services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
              (d) of  this  Item  that  were  approved  by the  audit  committee
              pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,
              because such services were pre-approved.

    (f)  Not applicable.

    (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to Service Affiliates
         for each of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the  registrant  was $1.2
         million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2004.

    (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  HAS
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to Service  Affiliates that were not pre-approved  pursuant to
         paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
         maintaining the principal accountant's independence.


ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.
<PAGE>

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The  registrant  is a fund of  funds  that  invests  primarily  in  unregistered
investment vehicles that have investors other than the registrant,  and in other
registered  investment  companies  ("Investment  Funds").  The Fund may invest a
majority of its assets in non-voting securities of Investment Funds.

The registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio  holdings
to UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser"),  to vote the Fund's  proxies in
accordance with the Adviser's proxy voting  guidelines and procedures.  However,
Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors for vote. If an
Investment  Fund submits a matter to the registrant for vote (and the registrant
holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund),  the Adviser will vote on the
matter in a way that it believes is in the best interest of the  registrant  and
in  accordance  with  the  following   proxy  voting   guidelines  (the  "Voting
Guidelines"):

       o     In voting  proxies,  the  Adviser  is guided by  general  fiduciary
             principles.  The Adviser's goal is to act prudently,  solely in the
             best interest of the registrant.

       o     The Adviser attempts to consider all factors of its vote that could
             affect  the value of the  investment  and will vote  proxies in the
             manner that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
             shareholder values.

       o     The Adviser, absent a particular reason to the contrary,  generally
             will vote with  management's  recommendations  on routine  matters.
             Other matters will be voted on a case-by-case basis.

The Adviser  applies its Voting  Guidelines in a manner designed to identify and
address  material  conflicts that may arise between the Adviser's  interests and
those of its  clients  before  voting  proxies  on behalf of such  clients.  The
Adviser  relies on the following to seek to identify  conflicts of interest with
respect to proxy voting and assess their materiality:

       o     The Adviser's  employees are under an obligation (i) to be aware of
             the  potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser
             with respect to voting proxies on behalf of client accounts both as
             a result of an employee's personal relationships and due to special
             circumstances  that may arise  during the conduct of the  Adviser's
             business,  and (ii) to bring  conflicts  of  interest of which they
             become aware to the attention of certain designated persons.

       o     Such  designated  persons  work with  appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to determine whether an identified  conflict of interest is
             material. A conflict of interest will be considered material to the
             extent that it is  determined  that such conflict has the potential
             to influence the Adviser's decision-making in voting the proxy. All
             materiality  determinations  will be based on an  assessment of the
             particular  facts and  circumstances.  The Adviser shall maintain a
<PAGE>

             written record of all materiality determinations.

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is not  material,
             the Adviser may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the existence of the
             conflict.

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is material,  the
             Adviser's legal department works with appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to agree upon a method to resolve such conflict of interest
             before voting  proxies  affected by the conflict of interest.  Such
             methods may include:

             o disclosing the conflict to the  registrant's  Board and obtaining
               the consent from registrant's Board before voting;

             o engaging  another party on behalf of the client to vote the proxy
               on its behalf;

             o engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the
               proxy based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

             o such   other   method   as  is  deemed   appropriate   under  the
               circumstances given the nature of the conflict.

       o     The Adviser shall  maintain a written  record of the method used to
             resolve a material conflict of interest.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Not yet applicable.


ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
        COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

Not applicable.


ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

requirements of Item  7(d)(2)(ii)(G)  of Schedule 14A (17 CFR  240.14a-101),  or

    (a)  The registrant's  principal executive and principal financial officers,
         or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  have  concluded  that the
         registrant's  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as defined in Rule
         30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the
         "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)))  are effective,  as of a date within
         90 days of the filing date of the report that  includes the  disclosure
         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
         Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
         240.15d-15(b)).
<PAGE>

    (b)  There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered by this  report  that have  materially
         affected,   or  is  reasonably   likely  to  materially   affect,   the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

I, Richard Sipes, certify that:


1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of UBS M2 Fund L.L.C.;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material

         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or

I, Michael Mascis, certify that:


1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of UBS M2 Fund L.L.C.;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as
         defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed
              under our supervision,  to provide reasonable  assurance regarding
              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and
<PAGE>

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
