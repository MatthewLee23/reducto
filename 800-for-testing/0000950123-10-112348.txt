*    The ratios for this period have been annualized. Organizational expenses
     included in these ratios have not been annualized.

(a)  Average Members' Capital is determined by using the net assets at the end
     of each month during the period and net assets at the beginning of the
     period.

(b)  The ratio reflects the income and expenses including the TI 2 Fund's
     proportionate share of income and expenses of Grosvenor Registered
     Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC.

(c)  The ratio reflects the expenses including the TI 2 Fund's proportionate
     share of the expenses of Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund,
     LLC.

(d)  The ratio is before any expense limitation reimbursement per the Expense
     Limitation Agreement.

(e)  The total return is not annualized. Total return assumes a purchase of an
     Interest in the TI 2 Fund on the first day and the sale of an Interest on
     the last day of the period and is calculated by using geometrically linked
     monthly returns. An individual Member's return may vary from these returns
     based on the timing of Member subscriptions and repurchases.

                               September 30, 2010

1.   ORGANIZATION

     Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 2), LLC (the "TI 2 Fund") is
     registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
     Act"), as a closed-end, diversified, management investment company. The TI
     2 Fund was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of
     Delaware on October 26, 2009 and commenced operations on July 1, 2010. The
     TI 2 Fund has many of the features of a private investment fund. The TI 2
     Fund's interests ("Interests") are offered only in private placements to
     persons (i) who are both "accredited investors" under the Securities Act of
     1933, as amended, and "qualified clients" under the Investment Advisers Act
     of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and (ii) who meet other investor
     eligibility criteria established by the TI 2 Fund. The primary investment
     objectives of the TI 2 Fund are to provide investors (i) an attractive,
     long- term rate of return, on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted basis,
     (ii) low performance volatility and (iii) minimal correlation with the
     equity and fixed income markets. The TI 2 Fund seeks to achieve these
     objectives by investing substantially all of its assets in Grosvenor
     Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the "Company"), also a Delaware
     limited liability company registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end,
     diversified, management investment company. The Company employs a
     multi-strategy, multi-manager investment strategy as detailed in its
     financial statements which are attached herein. There can be no assurance
     that the investment objectives of the TI 2 Fund or the Company will be
     achieved. The investment managers of the private investment funds in which
     the Company invests generally conduct their investment programs through
     these investment funds (collectively, the "Portfolio Funds"). The Company
     invests in the Portfolio Funds as a limited partner along with other
     investors.

     The financial statements of the Company, including the Schedule of
     Investments, are attached to this report and should be read in conjunction
     with the TI 2 Fund's financial statements. As of September 30, 2010, the TI
     2 Fund's beneficial ownership of the Company's Members' Capital was 0.70%.

     Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC ("BACA") serves as the investment
     adviser (the "Adviser") of the Company and the management services provider
     of the TI 2 Fund. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under
     the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
     Bank of America Corporation ("BAC"). BAC is a financial holding company
     which has its principal executive offices at 101 North Tryon Street,
     Charlotte, North Carolina. The Adviser provides various management and
     administrative services to the Company and the TI 2 Fund.

     The Adviser has retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor" or
     the "Subadviser") as the subadviser to the Company, which is also
     registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Subadviser
     is responsible for implementing the Company's investment strategy and
     managing the Company's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in
     accordance with the investment objective, philosophy and strategy described
     in the Company's registration statement and is subject to oversight by the
     Adviser and the board of directors of the Company, whose members also
     comprise the TI 2 Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board").

     The Board has overall responsibility to manage and supervise the operations
     of the TI 2 Fund, including the exclusive authority to oversee and to
     establish policies regarding the management,

1.   ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

     conduct and operation of the TI 2 Fund's business. The Board exercises the
     same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the TI 2 Fund as
     customarily exercised by directors of a typical investment company
     registered under the 1940 Act and organized as a corporation. The Board has
     engaged the Adviser to manage the day-to-day operations of the TI 2 Fund.

     Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated serves as the
     servicing agent and the placement agent of the TI 2 Fund (the "Servicing
     Agent" or the "Placement Agent"). It is an indirect subsidiary of BAC and
     an affiliate of the Adviser.

     Subscriptions for Interests in the TI 2 Fund by eligible investors may be
     accepted as of the first day of each month, or at such times as the Board
     may determine. The TI 2 Fund may, from time to time, offer to repurchase
     Interests from its members (the "Members") pursuant to written tenders by
     Members. These repurchase offers will be made at such times and on such
     terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, subject to
     the liquidity of the TI 2 Fund's assets and other factors considered by the
     Board. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the TI
     2 Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Members four times each year,
     effective as of the last day of each calendar quarter. Members can only
     transfer or assign Interests under certain limited circumstances. Member
     repurchases are recognized as liabilities when the amount becomes fixed.
     This generally will occur on the last day of a fiscal period.

     As of the last day of each calendar month, the TI 2 Fund allocates net
     profits or losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Members, in
     proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such
     period (after taking into account any Member subscriptions deemed to be
     made as of the first day of such period).

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
     believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the TI 2 Fund's financial
     statements are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could
     differ from these estimates.

B.   EXPENSES

     The TI 2 Fund bears its own expenses and, indirectly, bears a pro rata
     portion of the Company's expenses incurred in its business, including, but
     not limited to, the following: fees paid directly or indirectly to the
     investment managers of the Portfolio Funds; all costs and expenses directly
     related

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B.   EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     to the portfolio transactions and positions for the Company's account;
     legal fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial and escrow fees; fees
     paid to the TI 2 Fund's and the Company's administrator; costs of
     insurance; management fees and advisory fees; the fees and travel expenses
     and other expenses of the TI 2 Fund's and the Company's Boards; all costs
     with respect to communications regarding the TI 2 Fund's and the Company's
     transactions among the Adviser and any custodian or other agent engaged by
     the TI 2 Fund; and other types of expenses approved by the TI 2 Fund's and
     the Company's Boards. The expenses of the Portfolio Funds are not included
     in the TI 2 Fund's Statement of Operations or the Financial Highlights.

     The Adviser, the Subadviser and the TI 2 Fund have entered into an expense
     limitation and reimbursement agreement (the "Expense Limitation Agreement")
     under which the Adviser and Subadviser (the "Advisory Entities") will,
     subject to possible reimbursement by the TI 2 Fund as described below,
     waive fees or pay or absorb expenses of the TI 2 Fund (including the TI 2
     Fund's share of the ordinary operating expenses of the Company, but
     excluding any fees, expenses and incentive allocations of the Portfolio
     Funds) to the extent necessary to limit the ordinary operating expenses of
     the TI 2 Fund (including the TI 2 Fund's share of the ordinary operating
     expenses of the Company, but excluding taxes, interest and related costs of
     borrowing, brokerage commissions, the management fee and the TI 2 Fund's
     pro rata portion of the Company's advisory fee, and any extraordinary
     expenses of the TI 2 Fund and the Company) to 2.34% per annum of the TI 2
     Fund's average monthly net assets (the "Expense Limitation"). In
     consideration of the Advisory Entities' agreement to limit the TI 2 Fund's
     expenses, the TI 2 Fund will carry forward the amount of fees waived and
     expenses paid or absorbed by the Advisory Entities in excess of the Expense
     Limitation, for a period not to exceed three years from the end of the
     fiscal year in which the fee was waived or the expense was paid or
     absorbed, and will reimburse the Advisory Entities such amounts.
     Reimbursement will be made as promptly as possible, but only to the extent
     it does not cause the TI 2 Fund's annualized ordinary operating expenses to
     exceed the Expense Limitation in effect at the time that the fee was waived
     or the expense was paid or absorbed. The Expense Limitation Agreement will
     remain in effect until March 31, 2011 and will automatically continue in
     effect from year to year thereafter unless terminated by the Adviser,
     Subadviser or the TI 2 Fund.

     For the period ended September 30, 2010, the TI 2 Fund incurred $196,126 of
     total expenses, all of which were subject to the Expense Limitation
     Agreement. The TI 2 Fund is responsible for paying $18,170 of the total
     expenses subject to the Expense Limitation Agreement. The Advisory Entities
     have reimbursed the TI 2 Fund $77,860 of the total expenses in excess of
     the Expense Limitation, and the remaining $100,096 has been recorded as a
     receivable from the Advisory Entities on the Statement of Assets,
     Liabilities and Members' Capital. The receivable from the Advisory Entities
     is eligible for future reimbursement by the TI 2 Fund for up to three years
     per the Expense Limitation Agreement. Reimbursement of expenses carried
     forward is dependent on future levels of Members' Capital and expenses of
     the TI 2 Fund and the Company.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C.   INCOME TAXES

     As a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership, no
     provision for the payment of federal, state or local income taxes has been
     provided by the TI 2 Fund. Each Member is individually required to report
     on its own tax return its share of the TI 2 Fund's taxable income or loss.
     The TI 2 Fund has a tax year end of December 31.

     Net investment income or loss and net realized and unrealized gain or loss
     from investments of the TI 2 Fund for each fiscal period are allocated
     among, and credited to or debited against, the capital accounts of all
     Members as of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each
     Member's respective investment percentage for the fiscal period, as defined
     in the TI 2 Fund's Limited Liability Company Agreement.

     The cost of the TI 2 Fund's investment in the Company for federal income
     tax purposes is based on amounts reported to the TI 2 Fund by the Company
     on a Schedule K-1. As of September 30, 2010, the Company has not yet
     received information to determine the current tax cost of the Portfolio
     Funds. Based on the purchases and sales between July 1, 2010 (commencement
     of operations) and September 30, 2010, the estimated cost of the TI 2
     Fund's investment in the Company at September 30, 2010 for federal tax
     purposes is $3,450,000. The resulting estimated net unrealized appreciation
     for tax purposes on the TI 2 Fund's investment in the Company at September
     30, 2010 is $97,589.

     The authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty
     in tax positions requires management to determine whether a tax position of
     the TI 2 Fund is "more likely than not" to be sustained upon examination,
     including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
     on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the
     "more likely than not" threshold, the tax amount recognized in the
     financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater
     than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
     with the relevant taxing authority. The TI 2 Fund recognizes interest and
     penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax
     expense in the Statement of Operations. During the period of July 1, 2010
     (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2010, the TI 2 Fund did not
     incur any interest or penalties.

D.   OTHER

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts maintained in a PFPC Trust
     Company interest-bearing account. Interest income is recorded on the
     accrual basis.

     The TI 2 Fund records its proportionate share of the Company's income,
     expenses, realized and unrealized gains and losses. In addition, the TI 2
     Fund records its own income and expenses on the accrual basis.

3.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The TI 2 Fund records its investment in the Company at fair value, which
     represents the TI 2 Fund's proportionate interest in the Company. The
     performance of the TI 2 Fund is directly affected by the performance of the
     Company. The valuation of investments held by the Company is discussed in
     the notes to the Company's financial statements attached to this report.

4.   MANAGEMENT FEE

     Pursuant to a management agreement between the TI 2 Fund and the Adviser,
     the Adviser is entitled to a management fee (the "Management Fee"), paid
     monthly in arrears, equal to an annual rate of 0.50% of the Members' ending
     monthly capital of the TI 2 Fund before taking into consideration the
     Management Fee, prior to any repurchases or distribution of capital during
     the month. The portion of the Management Fee attributable to a Member's

     Affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending,
     brokerage, or other business relationships with the Portfolio Funds in
     which the Company invests and with the companies in which the Portfolio
     Funds invest.

     The Board is made up of five Board members who are not "interested
     persons", as defined by the 1940 Act, (the "Disinterested Directors").
     Until July 1, 2010, each Disinterested Director received per-meeting fees
     of: $500 for attendance at quarterly meetings of the Board; and $500 for
     telephonic participation at a quarterly Board meeting or for participation
     at a telephonic special meeting of the Board. Effective July 1, 2010,
     compensation to the Board is paid and expensed by the Company. All
     Disinterested Directors may be reimbursed for out-of- pocket expenses of
     attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board or of any
     committee thereof and for their expenses, if any, in connection with any
     other service or activity they perform or engage in as Disinterested
     Directors.

     PFPC Trust Company, which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing
     Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the TI 2
     Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the TI 2 Fund. On July 1,
     2010, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. sold the outstanding stock of
     PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. to The Bank of New York Mellon
     Corporation. At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing
     (U.S.) Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc.
     BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. serves as administrator and
     accounting agent to the TI 2 Fund and in that capacity provides certain
     accounting, record keeping, investor related services, and regulatory
     administrative services. The TI 2 Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
     and the administrator based primarily upon month-end Members' Capital.

     The TI 2 Fund has entered into a member services agreement with the
     Servicing Agent to provide (or arrange provision of) ongoing member and
     account maintenance services. As consideration for

5.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

     these services, the TI 2 Fund pays a monthly servicing fee (the "Servicing
     Fee") to the Servicing Agent at an annual rate of 0.25% of the net assets
     of the TI 2 Fund determined as of the last day of the month prior to any
     withdrawal or distribution of capital during the month.

     Investors may be charged a placement fee (sales load) (the "Placement Fee")
     on Interests placed by the Placement Agent of up to 2.50% of the investment
     amount if such amount is less than $500,000 (subject to the minimum
     investment). There is no Placement Fee on investments of $500,000 or more.
     The Placement Fee is paid to the Placement Agent. The Placement Fee is
     waived for certain investors.

6.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
     CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

     In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These may include, but
     are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
     contracts for differences and equity swaps. However, as a result of the
     investments by the Company as a limited partner or member, the Company's
     liability with respect to its investments in the Portfolio Funds is
     generally limited to the net asset value of its interest in each Portfolio
     Fund.

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in
     meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Among other
     things liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or
     unsecured sources of financing, an inability to sell assets or to withdraw
     capital from the Portfolio Funds, or unforeseen outflows of cash. This
     situation may arise due to circumstances outside of the Company's control,
     such as a general market disruption or an operational problem affecting the
     Company or third parties, including the Portfolio Funds. Also, the ability
     to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to
     sell similar assets at the same time.

     The Company's capital investment in the Portfolio Funds can be withdrawn on
     a limited basis. This may limit the ability of the Company to provide
     liquidity to the TI 2 Fund, and the TI 2 Fund may not be able to liquidate
     quickly some of its investment in the Company in order to meet liquidity
     requirements.

7.   GUARANTEES

     In the normal course of business, the TI 2 Fund enters into contracts that
     contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide
     general indemnities. The TI 2 Fund's maximum exposure under these
     arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims against the TI
     2 Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the TI 2
     Fund expects the risk of loss due to these warranties and indemnities to be
     remote.

8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     The TI 2 Fund has evaluated all subsequent events through the date these
     financial statements were issued and noted the following:

     On September 29, 2010, the TI 2 Fund announced a tender offer to repurchase
     up to $500,000 of outstanding Interests from Members effective December 31,
     2010. The tender offer expired on October 27, 2010, and no Members
     requested to have their Interests repurchased.

     Members' subscriptions received in advance of $776,725 became Interests in
     the TI 2 Fund effective October 1, 2010.

     Subsequent to September 30, 2010, the TI 2 Fund received additional
     subscriptions from Members for Interests in the amount of $1,777,975 which
     became effective as of November 1, 2010.

*    Non-income producing investments. The Company's investments in Portfolio
     Funds are considered to be illiquid and may be subject to limitations on
     redemptions, including the assessment of early redemption fees.

**   See definition in the Portfolio Valuation note.

***  Based on the most recently available information provided by each Portfolio
     Fund.

**** From original investment date.

***** Available frequency of redemptions after initial lock-up period.

N/A  Initial lock-up period that has either expired prior to 9/30/2010 or the
     Portfolio Fund did not have an initial lock-up period. However, specific
     redemption restrictions may apply.

(a)  A portion or all of the Company's interest in the Portfolio Fund is held in
     side pockets which have restricted liquidity.

(b)  Formerly known as D.B. Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, L.P.

(1)  The Portfolio Fund is liquidating its assets and is in the process of
     returning capital to its limited partners. Due to the liquidation, the
     Portfolio Fund has suspended redemptions. The full liquidation is expected
     to take from two to four years.

(2)  The Portfolio Fund has limited redemption rights by creating a liquidating
     vehicle with the intention of liquidating its assets in a reasonable
     manner. The Company expects to receive the majority of its interest in the
     Portfolio Fund by the end of 2010.

(3)  All of the Company's remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund is held in
     side pockets.

(4)  Redemption not permitted during the life of the Portfolio Fund. Cash
     proceeds are distributed to limited partners as the Portfolio Fund's

(5)  Portfolio Fund suspended redemptions in October 2008 after establishing a
     Lehman Brothers International ("Lehman") holdback reserve for potential
     liabilities related to Lehman's insolvency. In March 2010, the Portfolio
     Fund announced a restructuring plan which included an option to continue
     participation in the Portfolio Fund and a liquidating option. The majority
     of the Portfolio Fund's investors including the Company selected the
     liquidating option; as a result, the Portfolio Fund will be liquidated.
     Under the terms of the liquidating option, the Company expects to receive
     approximately 60% of its interest by 12/31/2011 with payments to be made on
     a quarterly basis.

(6)  Approximately 20% of the fair value of the Company's non side pocketed
     interest in the Portfolio Fund has a lock-up period that expires on
     5/31/2011. The side pockets represent approximately 5% of the fair value of
     the Company's interest in the Portfolio Fund.

(7)  Approximately 23% of the fair value of the Company's non side pocketed
     interest in the Portfolio Fund has a lock-up period that expires on
     3/31/2011. The side pockets represent approximately 11% of the fair value
     of the Company's interest in the Portfolio Fund.

(8)  Approximately 8% of the fair value of the Company's interest in the
     Portfolio Fund has a lock-up period that expires on 6/30/2011.

(9)  Approximately 18% of the fair value of the Company's interest in the
     Portfolio Fund has a lock-up period that expires on 5/31/2011.

(10) Approximately 18% of the fair value of the Company's interest in the
     Portfolio Fund is held in a special liquidating vehicle ("SLV") which is
     not available for redemption. The term of the full liquidation of the SLV
     is unknown.

(11) Portfolio Fund invoked 1/16th investor-level gate as per its offering
     documents. Under the "1/16th" gate provision, limited partners can only
     redeem up to 1/16th of their capital account balances in each redemption
     period in the case the Portfolio Fund receives redemption requests
     exceeding 3% of firm-wide capital. The Company expects to receive its
     remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund at the next available redemption

                               September 30, 2010

1. ORGANIZATION

     Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC, formerly known as
     Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Company"), is a
     Delaware limited liability company registered under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end management
     investment company and is operating as a diversified investment company.
     The primary investment objectives of the Company are to provide investors:
     (i) an attractive, long-term rate of return, on an absolute basis as well
     as a risk-adjusted basis; (ii) low performance volatility; and (iii)
     minimal correlation with the equity and fixed income markets. The Company
     employs a multi-strategy, multi-manager investment strategy premised on the
     risk control benefits of diversification and the value of a hedged
     investment approach. The Company seeks diversification by investing in
     partnerships and other private investment vehicles (the "Portfolio Funds")
     that (i) pursue non-traditional investment strategies and (ii) are
     expected to exhibit a low degree of performance correlation, not only with
     broad market indices but also with each other. These Portfolio Funds are
     managed by selected investment managers ("Investment Managers") who
     specialize in the chosen strategies. There can be no assurance that the
     investment objectives of the Company will be achieved.

     On January 1, 2010, pursuant to member approval, the Company was
     reorganized into a "master/feeder" investment structure (the
     "Reorganization"). Effective as of the close of business on that date, the
     Company became a master fund, and members of the Company contributed their
     interests to a new entity, Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 1),
     LLC (the "TI 1 Fund"), in exchange for interests in the TI 1 Fund. The TI 1
     Fund in turn invested substantially all of its assets into the Company. The
     TI 1 Fund had no assets, liabilities, or operations prior to the
     Reorganization.

     The TI 1 Fund and Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Fund (TI 2), LLC (the
     "TI 2 Fund") is each a Delaware limited liability company that is
     registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end, diversified, management
     investment company. The TI 1 Fund, the TI 2 Fund and Grosvenor
     Multi-Strategy Offshore Fund, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the
     "Ltd Fund" and together with the TI 1 Fund and TI 2 Fund, the "Feeder
     Funds"), pursue their investment objectives by investing substantially all
     of their assets in the Company. The Feeder Funds have the same investment
     objectives and substantially the same investment policies as the Company
     (except that the Feeder Funds pursue their investment objectives by
     investing in the Company).

     Effective April 1, 2010, Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC ("BACA")
     serves as the investment adviser (the "Adviser") of the Company. The
     Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
     Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act") . The Adviser is an
     indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BAC").
     BAC is a financial holding company which has its principal executive
     offices at 101 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina. The Adviser
     provides various management and administrative services to the Company.

     The Adviser has retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor" or
     the "Subadviser") as the subadviser to the Company, which is also
     registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Subadviser
     is responsible for implementing the Company's investment strategy

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

     and managing the Company's investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis, in
     accordance with the investment objective, philosophy and strategy described
     in the Company's registration statement and is subject to oversight by the
     Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company.

     The Board has overall responsibility to manage and supervise the operations
     of the Company, including the exclusive authority to oversee and to
     establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the
     Company's business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and
     responsibilities on behalf of the Company as customarily exercised by
     directors of a typical investment company registered under the 1940 Act and
     organized as a corporation. The Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the
     day-to-day operations of the Company.

     As of September 30, 2010, the TI 1 Fund's ownership of the Company's
     Members' Capital was 94.14%, the TI 2 Fund's ownership of the Company's
     Members' Capital was 0.70%, and the Ltd Fund's ownership of the Company's
     Members' Capital was 5.15%. The remaining 0.01% was held by BACAP
     Alternative Advisors, Inc., an affiliate of the Adviser ("BACAP" and
     together with the Feeder Funds, the "Members").

     Interests in the Company ("Interests") are generally offered only to the
     Feeder Funds, and subscriptions for Interests may be accepted as of the
     first day of each month or at such times as the Board may determine. The
     Company may, from time to time, offer to repurchase Interests from its
     Members pursuant to written tenders by Members. These repurchase offers
     will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
     Board, in its sole discretion, subject to the liquidity of the Company's
     assets and other factors considered by the Board. The Adviser expects that
     it will recommend to the Board that the Company offer to repurchase
     Interests from Members four times each year, effective as of the last day
     of each calendar quarter. Members can only transfer or assign Interests
     under certain limited circumstances.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
     believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial
     statements are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could
     differ from these estimates.

B. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     ASU 2010-06 which requires new disclosures and provides amendments to ASC
     Subtopic 820-10 clarifying existing disclosures. The disclosure regarding
     the Level 3 investment roll-forward of purchases and sales activity on a
     gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
     2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this disclosure on
     its financial statements.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. COMPANY EXPENSES

     The Company bears certain expenses incurred in its business, including, but
     not limited to, the following: fees paid directly or indirectly to the
     investment managers of the Portfolio Funds; all costs and expenses directly
     related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Company's account;
     legal fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; fees paid to the
     Company's administrator; costs of insurance; advisory fees; subadvisory
     out-of-pocket fees; the fees and travel expenses and other expenses of the
     Board; all costs with respect to communications regarding the Company's
     transactions between the Adviser and any custodian or other agent engaged
     by the Company; and other types of expenses approved by the Board.
     Expenses, including incentive fees or allocations of the underlying
     Portfolio Funds, are not included in the Statement of Operations.

D. INCOME TAXES

     As a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership, no
     provision for the payment of federal, state or local income taxes has been
     provided by the Company. Each Member is individually required to report on
     its own tax return its share of the Company's taxable income or loss. The
     Company has a tax year end of December 31.

     The cost of the Company's investments in the Portfolio Funds for federal
     income tax purposes is based on amounts reported to the Company by the
     Portfolio Funds on a Schedule K-1. As of September 30, 2010, the Company
     has not yet received information to determine the current tax cost of the
     Portfolio Funds. Based on the amounts reported to the Company on Schedule
     K-1 as of December 31, 2009, and after adjustment for purchases and sales
     between December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2010, the estimated cost of the
     Portfolio Funds at September 30, 2010 for federal tax purposes is
     $438,052,738. The resulting estimated net unrealized appreciation for tax
     purposes on the Portfolio Funds at September 30, 2010 is $36,858,722.

     The authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty
     in tax positions requires management to determine whether a tax position of
     the Company is "more likely than not" to be sustained upon examination,
     including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
     on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more
     likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial
     statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
     percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
     relevant taxing authority. Management analyzed all open tax years, as
     defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions and has
     determined that the adoption of this authoritative guidance did not have a
     material effect on the results of operations or financial position of the
     Company. The Company has determined that there are no unrecognized tax
     benefits or liabilities relating to uncertain income tax positions taken on
     prior years' returns or expected to be taken on the tax return for the year
     ended December 31, 2010. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if
     any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the
     Statement of Operations. During the six month period ended September 30,
     2010, the Company did not incur any interest or penalties.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

     Purchases of investments in the Portfolio Funds are recorded as of the
     first day of legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and withdrawals from the
     Portfolio Funds are recorded as of the last day of legal ownership.
     Redemptions received from the Portfolio Funds, whether in the form of cash
     or securities, are applied first as a reduction of the investment's cost,
     and any excess is treated as realized gain from investments in Portfolio
     Funds. Realized gains or losses on investments in the Portfolio Funds are
     recorded at the time of the disposition of the respective investment on an
     average cost basis.

F. OTHER

     Net investment income or loss and net realized and unrealized gain or
     loss from investments of the Company for each fiscal period are allocated
     between, and credited to or debited against, the capital accounts of
     Members as of the last day of the fiscal period in accordance with each
     Member's respective investment percentage for the fiscal period, as defined
     in the Company's Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Operating
     Agreement").

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts maintained in a PFPC Trust
     Company interest-bearing account and include overnight deposits in
     BlackRock Liquidity Funds, Temp Fund, an affiliate of BAC. Interest income
     is recorded on the accrual basis.

G. FUTURES

     From time to time, the Company may use futures primarily for tactical
     hedging purposes. Initial margin deposits of cash and securities are made
     upon entering into futures contracts. The contracts are marked to market
     monthly and the resulting changes in value are accounted for as unrealized
     gains and losses. Variation margin payments are paid or received, depending
     upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When the contract is
     closed, the Company records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
     between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transaction and the
     amount invested in the contract. Risks of entering into futures contracts
     include the possibility that there will be an imperfect price correlation
     between the futures and the underlying securities. Second, it is possible
     that a lack of liquidity for futures contracts could exist in the secondary
     market, resulting in an inability to close a position prior to its maturity
     date. Third, the futures contract involves risk that the Company could lose
     more than the original margin deposit required to initiate a futures
     transaction.

     The risk exists that losses could exceed amounts disclosed on the Schedule
     of Investments or Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.
     For the six month period ended September 30, 2010, the Company did not
     enter into any futures contracts.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

H. OPTIONS CONTRACTS

     An option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
     a specified item at a fixed price during a specified period for a
     nonrefundable fee (the "premium"). The maximum loss to the buyer is limited
     to the premium originally paid. The premiums paid for the purchase of these
     options are included in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
     capital as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
     value of the options, with unrealized appreciation and depreciation
     included in the Statement of Operations.

     If the Company were to purchase or write options, it would receive a
     premium and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the prices of the
     securities or index instruments underlying the options. Premiums received
     from writing put and call options which have not expired are presented in
     the liabilities section of the statement of assets, liabilities and
     members' capital and subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
     the options written, but not less than zero. If the current market value of
     an option exceeds the premium received, the excess is recorded as an
     unrealized loss and, conversely, if the premium exceeds the current market
     value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded as an
     unrealized gain. The risk exists that losses could exceed amounts disclosed
     on the schedule of investments or Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
     Members' Capital. For the six month period ended September 30, 2010, the
     Company did not purchase or write any options contracts.

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The net asset value (the "NAV") of the Company is determined by, or at the
     direction of, the Adviser as of the close of business at the end of each
     fiscal period (as defined in the Company's Operating Agreement), in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below, or as may be
     determined from time to time, pursuant to valuation procedures established
     by the Board. Pursuant to the valuation procedures, the Board has delegated
     to the Adviser the general responsibility for valuation of the investments
     in the Portfolio Funds subject to the oversight by the Board.

     The investments in the Portfolio Funds are recorded at fair value,
     generally at an amount equal to the NAV of the Company's investment in the
     Portfolio Funds as determined by the Portfolio Fund's general partner or
     investment manager. If no such information is available or if such
     information is deemed to be not reflective of fair value, an estimated fair
     value is determined in good faith by the Adviser pursuant to the valuation
     procedures. Generally, the NAVs of investments in the Portfolio Funds are
     determined whereby the Company records the investment and subsequent
     subscriptions at its acquisition cost which represents its fair value. The
     investment is adjusted to reflect the Company's share of net investment
     income or loss and unrealized and realized gain or loss that reflects the
     changes in the fair value of the investment for the period.

     The Portfolio Funds record their investments at fair value in accordance
     with GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. The Portfolio
     Funds generally hold positions in readily marketable securities and
     derivatives that are valued at quoted market values and/or less liquid
     nonmarketable

                               September 30, 2010

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     securities and derivatives that are valued at estimated fair value.
     Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that might
     be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments, nor do they
     reflect other expenses or fees that might be incurred upon disposition. The
     mix and concentration of more readily marketable securities and less liquid
     nonmarketable securities varies across the Portfolio Funds based on various
     factors, including the nature of their investment strategy and market
     forces.

     Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations of the investments in the
     Portfolio Funds, their estimated values may differ significantly from the
     values that would have been used had a ready market for the Portfolio Funds
     existed, and the differences could be material. Net change in accumulated
     unrealized appreciation on investments in the Statement of Operations is
     net of fees and performance-based compensation paid to the investment
     managers of the Portfolio Funds.

     Some of the Portfolio Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in
     illiquid securities and may hold a portion or all of these investments
     independently from the main portfolio. These separate baskets of illiquid
     securities ("side pockets") may be subject to additional restrictions of
     liquidity that are stricter than the liquidity restrictions applicable to
     general interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Company withdraws its
     interest from such a Portfolio Fund, it may be required to maintain its
     holding in the side pocket investments for an extended period of time and
     retain this remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund. In instances where
     such a Portfolio Fund closes its operations, the Company may receive an
     "in-kind" distribution of a side pocket's holdings in liquidation of its
     entire interest in the Portfolio Fund. The value of side pockets may
     fluctuate significantly. As of September 30, 2010, the Company's
     investments in side pockets represented 2.38% of the Company's net assets.
     Additionally, the governing documents of the Portfolio Funds generally
     provide that the Portfolio Funds may suspend, limit or delay the right of
     their investors, such as the Company, to withdraw capital. Restrictions
     applicable to individual Portfolio Funds are described in detail on the
     Company's Schedule of Investments.

     The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
     valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair
     value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell
     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
     market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Accordingly,
     the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
     prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
     measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
     measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

     -    Level 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical,
          unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
          access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2 -- Quoted prices which are not considered to be active, or
          inputs that are observable (either directly or indirectly) for
          substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

     -    Level 3 -- Prices, inputs or modeling techniques which are both
          significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
          by little or no market activity).

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     The preparation of the Schedule of Investments in conformity with GAAP
     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     amounts reported in the Schedule of Investments and accompanying notes.
     Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's
     Schedule of Investments are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual
     results could differ from these estimates. The Company relies upon the
     authoritative guidance under GAAP for estimating the fair value of
     investments in the Portfolio Funds that have calculated the NAV per share
     in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment
     companies. Accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of an
     investment in a Portfolio Fund using the NAV of the investment (or its
     equivalent) without further adjustment unless the Adviser determines that
     the NAV is deemed to be not reflective of the fair value.

     Investments may be classified as Level 2 when market information
     (observable NAVs) is available, yet the investment is not traded in an
     active market and/or the investment is subject to transfer restrictions, or
     the valuation is adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or
     non-transferability. Market information, including observable NAVs,
     subscription and redemption activity at the underlying Portfolio Fund, and
     the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is
     considered when determining the proper categorization of the investment's
     fair value measurement within the fair valuation hierarchy. Portfolio Fund
     investment lots that have observable market inputs (published NAVs) and
     that the Company has the ability to redeem from within three months of the
     balance sheet date are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 2.

     The Company's investments in the Portfolio Funds that have unobservable
     inputs and/or from which the Company does not have the ability to redeem
     within three months are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 3.
     When observable prices are not available for these securities, the Company
     uses the market approach, as defined in the authoritative guidance on fair
     value measurements, to evaluate the fair value of such Level 3 instruments.

     The Company recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above
     at the beginning of the reporting period. All transfers into and out of
     Level 3 can be found in the Level 2 and Level 3 reconciliation tables.
     There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.

     The following table sets forth information about the level within the fair
     value hierarchy at which the Portfolio Fund investments are measured at
     September 30, 2010:

     The Company adopted authoritative guidance that permits a reporting entity
     to measure the fair value of an investment that does not have a readily
     determinable fair value, based on the NAV per share for the investment. In
     using the NAV, certain attributes of the investment that may impact the
     fair value of the investment are not considered in measuring fair value.
     Attributes of those investments include the investment strategies of the
     investees and may also include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the
     investor's ability to redeem its investments at the measurement date and
     any unfunded commitments. The Company is permitted to invest in alternative
     investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and as
     such, has determined that the NAV, as calculated by the reporting entity,
     represents the fair value of the investments. A listing of the investments
     held by the Company and their attributes as of September 30, 2010, that may
     qualify for these valuations are shown in the table below.

*    The information summarized in the table above represents the general terms
     of the specific asset class. Individual Portfolio Funds may have terms that
     are more or less restrictive than those terms indicated for the asset class
     as a whole. In addition, most Portfolio Funds have the flexibility, as
     provided for in constituent documents, to modify and waive such terms.

**   Reflects fair value of investments in each respective investment category.

The Company's investments reflect their estimated fair value, which for
marketable securities would generally be the last sales price on the primary
exchange for such security, and for the Portfolio Funds, would generally be the
NAV as provided by the Portfolio Fund or its administrator. For each of the
classes below, the fair value of the Portfolio Funds has been estimated using
the NAV of the Portfolio Funds.

(A) DISTRESSED SECURITIES This class includes the Portfolio Funds that invest in
debt and equity securities of companies in financial difficulty, reorganization
or bankruptcy, nonperforming and subperforming bank loans, and emerging market
debt. As of September 30, 2010, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments
to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy.

(B) EVENT DRIVEN This class includes the Portfolio Funds that take significant
positions in companies with special situations, including distressed stocks,
mergers and takeovers. As of September 30, 2010, the Company had no unfunded
capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy.

(C) LONG AND/OR SHORT EQUITIES This class includes the Portfolio Funds that make
long and short investments in equity securities that are deemed by the
Investment Managers to be under or overvalued. The Investment Managers typically
do not attempt to neutralize the amount of long and short positions. As of
September 30, 2010, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments to the
Portfolio Funds within this strategy.

3. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     (D) MULTI-ARBITRAGE This class includes the Portfolio Funds that seek to
     exploit price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on
     different markets or in different forms by simultaneously purchasing and
     selling an asset in order to profit from the difference. As of September
     30, 2010, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio
     Funds within this strategy.

     As of September 30, 2010, the Company had investments in 54 Portfolio
     Funds. The Company, as an investor in these Portfolio Funds is charged
     management fees of up to 3% (per annum) of the NAV of its ownership
     interests in the Portfolio Funds, as well as incentive fees or allocations
     of up to 20% of net profits earned that are attributable to the Company's
     ownership interests in such Portfolio Funds. The Company also generally
     bears a pro rata share of the other expenses of each Portfolio Fund in
     which it invests. Total expenses, including incentive fees or allocations,
     for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, ranged from approximately 0.51%
     to 12.38% of the Company's average invested capital in each Portfolio Fund.
     Incentive fees or allocations for the same fiscal year ranged from
     approximately 0.00% to 8.27% of the Company's average invested capital in
     each Portfolio Fund. These ratios may vary over time depending on the
     allocation of the Company's assets among the Portfolio Funds and the actual
     expenses and investment performance of the Portfolio Funds. Although the
     foregoing ranges of Portfolio Fund expense ratios are based on audited
     financial data received from the Portfolio Funds, the ranges were not
     audited by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

     For the six months ended September 30, 2010, aggregate purchases and sales
     of the Portfolio Funds amounted to $83,900,000 and $61,740,475,
     respectively.

4. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO THE PORTFOLIO FUNDS

     As of September 30, 2010, the Company had no unfunded capital commitments
     to the Portfolio Funds.

5. ADVISORY FEE

     Pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreement between the Company and the
     Adviser, the Company pays the Adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of
     1.00% (the "Advisory Fee") based on the Company's net assets determined as
     of the last business day before taking into consideration the Advisory
     Fee. For the six month period ended September 30, 2010, the Advisory Fee
     was $2,492,389. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement between
     the Adviser and the Subadviser, the Adviser pays 75% of the Advisory Fee it
     receives from the Company to the Subadviser. The Subadviser is also
     reimbursed by the Company for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
     Subadviser related to the Company, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

     As part of the Reorganization, the incentive allocation was eliminated as
     of January 1, 2010. Prior to the Reorganization, an incentive allocation
     was calculated with respect to each Member on the last business day of a
     calendar year and upon repurchase of all or any portion of such Investor's
     Interest (an "Incentive Period"). An Incentive Period for each Member's
     Interest started immediately following the preceding Incentive Period and
     ended on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of
     a calendar year; (ii) the next repurchase of all or any portion of such
     Member's Interest; (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser
     (collectively the "Special Members") in connection with such party ceasing
     to serve as Adviser or Subadviser to the Company; or (iv) the dissolution
     of the Company. The aggregate incentive allocation (to the Special Members)
     for an Incentive Period equaled 10% of the amount, if any, in excess of (a)
     profit net of losses (after taking into account expenses, including the
     management fee paid by the Company) allocated to each Member's capital
     account for such Incentive Period over (b) the greater of (i) the Member's
     Hurdle Rate Amount for that Incentive Period and (ii) the balance in the
     Member's Loss Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

     A Member's "Loss Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period was zero
     and for each Incentive Period thereafter was equal to the Member's Loss
     Carryforward as of the end of the immediately preceding Incentive Period,
     increased or decreased, but not below zero, by the positive or negative
     difference between the net losses over net profits allocated to the Member
     for the current Incentive Period.

     The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive if its
     Interest as of the beginning of that Incentive Period (adjusted
     appropriately for any additional subscriptions) earned a rate of return
     equal to the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of
     each calendar quarter and reset on the first day of each calendar quarter.
     The Hurdle Rate Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive
     Period.

     In the case of a repurchase of only a portion of an Interest other than on
     the last business day of the calendar year, the Member was treated as
     having two independent Interests in the Company, one of which was being
     repurchased in its entirety. Allocations to the Investor and subscriptions
     made by the Member during the Incentive Period prior to such repurchase,
     and the Member's opening capital account balance and Loss Carryforward as
     of the beginning of such Incentive Period, were allocated between the two
     Interests in proportion to the portion of the Member's Interest that was
     repurchased.

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending,
     brokerage, or other business relationships with the Portfolio Funds in
     which the Company invests and with companies in which the Portfolio Funds
     invest.

     The Board is made up of five Directors who are not "interested persons," as
     defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company (the
     "Disinterested Directors"). Until July 1, 2010, the Disinterested Directors
     received an annual retainer of $10,000 and per-meeting fees of: $2,000 for


                                       21

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     in-person attendance at quarterly meetings of the Board; $1,000 for
     telephone participation at a quarterly Board meeting or for participation
     at a telephonic special meeting of the Board; and $1,000 for each audit
     committee meeting (whether held in-person or by telephone). Certain
     Board-related fees were incurred directly in the Feeder Funds. Effective
     July 1, 2010, the Disinterested Directors receive an annual retainer of
     $40,000 for their services to the Company and the Feeder Funds, and no
     longer receive any per-meeting fees. The retainer is paid by the Company
     and allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds. All Disinterested Directors may
     be reimbursed for expenses of attendance at each regular or special meeting
     of the Board or of any committee thereof and for their expenses, if any, in
     connection with any other service or activity they perform or engage in as
     Directors. The Company incurred $97,000 of retainer- and Board-related fees
     for the period from April 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010, none of which was
     payable as of September 30, 2010.

     PFPC Trust Company, which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing
     Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the Company's
     assets and provides custodial services for the Company. On July 1 2010, The
     PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. sold the outstanding stock of PNC Global
     Investment Servicing Inc. to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. At
     the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc changed
     its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. BNY Mellon
     Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. serves as administrator and accounting
     agent to the Company and in that capacity provides certain accounting,
     record keeping, investor related services, and regulatory administrative
     services. The Company pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the
     administrator based primarily upon month-end Members' Capital.

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

     In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and may enter into
     various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,
     but are not limited to, short selling, writing option contracts, and equity
     swaps. However, as a result of the investments by the Company as a limited
     partner or member, the Company's liability with respect to its
     investments in the Portfolio Funds is generally limited to the NAV of its
     interest in each Portfolio Fund.

     Because the Company is a closed-end investment company, Interests are not
     redeemable at the option of Members and are not exchangeable for interests
     of any other fund. Although the Board in its discretion may cause the
     Company to offer from time to time to repurchase Interests at the Members'
     capital account value, Interests are considerably less liquid than shares
     of funds that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment
     companies. With respect to any offer to repurchase Interests by the
     Company, the aggregate repurchase amount will be determined by the Board in
     its discretion and such repurchase amount may represent only a small
     portion of outstanding Interests. Because the Company's investments in
     Portfolio Funds themselves have limited liquidity, the Company may not be
     able to fund significant repurchases. Members whose


                                       22

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

     Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the risk that the Company's
     members' capital account value may fluctuate significantly between the time
     that they submit their request for repurchase and the date as of which
     Interests are valued for the purpose of repurchase.

     As described in the footnotes of the Company's Schedule of Investments and
     in Note 3, some Portfolio Funds have suspended or restricted withdrawals of
     capital, which increases the liquidity risk for the Company. Liquidity risk
     is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting
     obligations associated with financial liabilities. Liquidity could be
     impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured sources of
     financing, an inability to sell assets or to withdraw capital from the
     Portfolio Funds, or unforeseen outflows of cash to meet tender demands.
     This situation may arise due to circumstances outside of the Company's
     control, such as a general market disruption or an operational issue
     affecting the Company or third parties, including the Portfolio Funds.
     Also, the ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market
     participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.

     The Company's capital invested in the Portfolio Funds can be withdrawn on a
     limited basis. As a result, the Company may not be able to liquidate
     quickly some of its investments in the Portfolio Funds in order to meet
     liquidity requirements.

     There are a number of other risks to the Company. Three principal types of
     risk that can adversely affect the Company's investment approach are market
     risk, strategy risk, and manager risk. The Company also is subject to
     multiple manager risks, possible limitations in investment opportunities,
     allocation risks, lack of diversification, and other risks for the Company
     and potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

9. GUARANTEES

     In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that
     contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide
     general indemnities. The Company's maximum exposure under these
     arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims against the
     Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
     Company expects the risk of loss due to these warranties and indemnities to
     be remote.

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date these
     financial statements were issued and noted the following:

     On September 29, 2010, the Company announced a tender offer to repurchase
     up to $51,000,000 of outstanding Interests from its Members. The net asset
     value of Interests will be calculated for this purpose on December 31,
     2010. The tender offer expired on October 27, 2010.

     Member subscriptions received in advance of $3,159,000 became Interests in
     the Company effective October 1, 2010.

     Subsequent to September 30, 2010, the Company received additional capital
     subscriptions from the Feeder Funds in the amount of $2,641,000. These
     subscriptions resulted in the issuance of additional Interests in the
     Company effective November 1, 2010.

     On November 2, 2010, the Company paid $17,487,433 to the TI 1 Fund for
     Interests repurchased by the TI 1 Fund on September 30, 2010.

                               September 30, 2010

           APPROVAL OF ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

          At a meeting held in person on September 24, 2010, the Board,
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the continuation of the
Company's investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the
Adviser and the subadvisory agreement (the "Subadvisory Agreement" and, together
with the Advisory Agreement, the "Advisory Agreements") with the Adviser and the
Subadviser for an additional one-year period. The Independent Directors were
assisted in their review of this matter by independent legal counsel and met in
an executive session with such counsel separate from representatives of the
Adviser and the Subadviser.

          In considering this matter, the Board reviewed various written
materials, including: performance information on and expense ratios of
comparable registered investment companies, including similar funds managed by
the Adviser; and information relating to the costs and profitability of the
Adviser and the Subadviser from their relationships with the Company
("Profitability Analysis"). The Board evaluated and considered: (i) the nature,
extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser and the Subadviser; (ii)
the investment performance of the Company; (iii) the costs of services provided
and the profits realized by the Adviser and the Subadviser from their
relationships with the Company; (iv) the extent to which economies of scale in
costs of providing services would be realized as the Company grows; and (v)
whether the fees payable to the Adviser and the Subadviser pursuant to the
Advisory Agreements properly reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of
investors. No single factor reviewed by the Board was identified by the Board as
the principal factor in determining whether to approve the Advisory Agreements.

          The Board discussed and reviewed the nature, extent and quality of
services that the Adviser and the Subadviser provide to the Company. The Board
also discussed the structure and capabilities of the Adviser and the Subadviser,
including technology and operational support, which support the services
provided to the Company. The Board agreed that the Company benefits from these
services, and assessed the nature, scope and quality of services provided to the
Company by the Adviser and the Subadviser as indicated by the materials and
information supplied to the Boards. In doing so, the Board considered the
Adviser's and the Subadviser's extensive administrative and compliance
infrastructure. Representatives of the Adviser confirmed that the Adviser has
adequate resources to deliver all required services to the Company and that the
Adviser and Bank of America are committed to registered funds of hedge funds.
The Board also reviewed and discussed the experience and qualifications of key
personnel of the Adviser and the Subadviser and reviewed biographical
information regarding such personnel. The Board also reviewed the financial
information and other information provided regarding the Adviser, the Subadviser
and Bank of America included in the 15(c) Materials. The Independent Directors
noted their overall satisfaction with the nature, quality and extent of services
provided by the Adviser and the Subadviser and concluded that the Company was
receiving all services required from the Adviser and the Subadviser under the
Advisory Agreements, and that the quality of these services was satisfactory.

     APPROVAL OF ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

          The Board also considered the investment performance of the Company
and compared the performance of the Company to that of comparable funds,
including other funds managed by the Adviser. The Board concluded that the
Company's performance compared favorably with the performance of similar
registered funds.

          The Board also evaluated the fee paid for advisory services, relying
on information concerning the fees and expenses of the Company, which was
contained in the materials provided to the Board. The Board compared those fees
and expenses to the advisory fees and expense ratios of other similar registered
funds of hedge funds, including another similar registered fund for which the
Adviser serves as investment adviser. In this regard, the Independent Directors
noted that the fee payable by the Company to the Adviser and the expenses of the
Company are within the range of those of similar funds. The Independent
Directors concluded that the fee payable to the Adviser, and the fee payable by
the Adviser to the Subadviser, is reasonable in light of comparative
performance, expense and advisory fee information and cost of the services
provided.

          The profitability realized by the Adviser and the Subadviser was also
considered. The Board relied principally on the Profitability Analysis.
Representatives of the Adviser stated that neither the Adviser nor the
Subadviser receives any significant indirect benefits from their relationships
with the Company. After reviewing the information contained in the Profitability
Analysis, the Board determined that the current profitability to each of the
Adviser and the Subadviser was not excessive.

          With regard to economies of scale, the Board was cognizant of the fact
that economies of scale in costs of providing services may be realized when
there is a significant increase in a fund's assets. The Independent Directors
concluded that, although the net assets of the Company have grown since its
inception, the assets of the Company have not reached a sufficient size to
support fee reductions based on economies of scale.

          Based on the information provided to the Board, and the considerations
and conclusions described above, the Board, including each of the Independent
Directors, determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its
members to continue in effect each of the Advisory Agreements for an additional
annual period.
