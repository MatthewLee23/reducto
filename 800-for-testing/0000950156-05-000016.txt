LETTER FROM THE CEO

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

For most investors, the main factor in determining long-term success is asset
allocation - how they spread their money among stocks, bonds, and cash. In
fact, the total returns of investors may be more influenced by their asset
allocation strategy than by their security selection within each asset class.
The principle behind asset allocation is simple: by diversifying across a
variety of types of securities, investors reduce the overall risk of their
portfolio because gains in one area are likely to offset losses in another.

One of the dangers of not having an asset allocation plan is the temptation to
simply chase performance, by moving money into whichever asset class appears to
be outperforming at the moment. The problem with this approach is that by the
time a particular area of the market comes into favor, investors may have
already missed some of the best performance. We would suggest that one way to
benefit from swings in the market is to acquire a diversified portfolio so that
investors hold a range of asset classes before the market swings in their
direction.

UNDERSTAND YOUR EMOTIONS

It usually takes a bear market for people to appreciate the benefits of
diversification. At MFS, we believe proper asset allocation is important in all
market environments. But we understand that there are emotional components of
investment decisions that sometimes keep investors from achieving their long
term goals. The three common behaviors that negatively impact investment
decisions are overconfidence, looking backwards, and loss aversion.

  o Overconfidence. After experiencing gains in the market, particularly during
    a bull market, investors have a natural tendency to overestimate their own
    abilities. During the global bull market of the late 1990s, for example, a
    large number of investors traded their own stocks and made significant
    profits. However, most of these same investors later handed back those
    profits - and then some - because they focused more on short-term blips in
    the market and less on the fundamental factors that affect a company's
    long-term prospects.

  o Looking backwards. Although security prices are determined by expectations
    about the future, many investors make choices based on the recent past.
    Investors who have achieved momentary success in the market tend to take on
    too much risk, believing that better- than-average returns can be easily
    duplicated. On the other hand, those who have had negative experiences tend
    to become overly cautious and take on too little risk. Recent historical
    experience tends to dictate an investor's frame of reference and may lead
    to irrational decisions.

  o Loss aversion. Simply put, investors would rather avoid the immediate pain
    of losses than enjoy the future pleasure of gains. As a result, some
    investors tend to overreact to short-term downturns in the market by
    seeking to mitigate their losses, rather than remaining invested to benefit
    from the long-term growth potential of the stock and bond markets.

THINK LIKE A PROFESSIONAL INVESTOR

Asset allocation helps reduce the emotional factors that tend to affect the
long-term returns of investors. Professional investors - those who manage
assets for money management firms, pension funds, and endowments - have tended
to outperform the average retirement investor because they focus on asset
allocation. For example, the investment performance of the average 401(k)
participant has lagged these professional investors by more than two percentage
points a year, on average, over the past 10 years.(1)

We think asset allocation is one of the most important decisions for investors.
A study of the performance of 91 large U.S. corporate pension plans with assets
of more than $100 million over a 10-year period beginning in 1974 concluded
that asset allocation policies accounted for 93.6% of their returns, while
individual security selection and the timing of their investments accounted for
only 6.4% for their overall performance.(2)

Professional investors target a realistic level of return based on the amount
of risk they are willing to take, then set allocations to meet their goals. On
average, U.S. professional investors allocate 35% to 40% of their assets to
domestic equity stocks; 20% to 30% to fixed income issues; 10% to international
stocks; and between 10% and 20% to other investment classes such as real
estate.(3) And within those categories, they hold a broad range of styles and
asset classes.

In contrast, 401(k) participants who held company stock in their retirement
plans at the end of 2002 had roughly 42% of their retirement assets in company
stock while the rest was allocated to either growth or value stock funds.(4)
These participants virtually ignored the broad range of equity, fixed-income,
and international offerings provided by their retirement plans.

ALLOCATE, DIVERSIFY, REBALANCE

We recommend working with a professional adviser to find an optimal mix of
investments based on your individual goals. In our view, a disciplined asset
allocation strategy is composed of three simple steps: allocate, diversify and
rebalance.

  o Allocate. Investors should work with their financial adviser to specify
    their long-term goals and tolerance for risk. Then investors should
    allocate their assets across the major asset classes - stocks, bonds, and
    cash - to help them pursue an investment return that is consistent with
    their risk tolerance level.

  o Diversify. By diversifying their assets, investors trade some performance
    in the top performing categories for a more predictable and stable
    portfolio. At the same time, investors should include different investment
    styles and market capitalizations of stocks and a range of fixed-income
    investments, as well as U.S. and non-U.S. securities. Because security
    subclasses tend to move in and out of favor during various market and
    economic environments, a broad portfolio increases the benefits of
    diversification.

  o Rebalance. We suggest that investors consult with their professional
    advisers periodically to rebalance their portfolios to maintain the
    percentages that they have dedicated to each asset class. Allocations can
    shift as markets rise and fall, making for a riskier or more conservative
    portfolio than an investor originally intended. For example, a portfolio of
    50% stocks and 50% bonds at the start of 2000 would have shifted to 32%
    stocks and 68% bonds at the end of 2002 because of the weak stock
    market.(5)

In short, these three simple concepts - allocate, diversify and rebalance -
help take emotion out of the investment process and help prevent investors
from trying to outguess the market. An asset allocation strategy cannot turn a
down market cycle into a good one, but it is an invaluable tool to manage risk
and keep investors on track toward reaching their long-term investment goals.

A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT PROCESS IS PARAMOUNT

Disciplined diversification has helped investors pursue long-term, above-
average results through the years. Since 1924, when we invented the mutual
fund, MFS(R) has strived to give investors the products and tools they need to
maintain well-diversified portfolios. MFS provides a variety of products in
each asset class as well as a family of asset allocation funds. These asset
allocation portfolios cover a range from conservative to moderate, growth, and
aggressive growth allocations, each with a strategy based on a distinct level
of risk. We recommend developing a comprehensive financial plan with an
investment advisor who is familiar with your risk tolerance, your individual
goals, and your financial situation.

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or
comments you may have.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the year ended October 31, 2004, the net asset value of MFS Municipal
Income Trust was up 9.72%, outpacing the 6.03% return for the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

In 2004, many measures of economic growth, including employment, corporate
spending, and earnings growth continued to improve, though we feel that near-
record-high oil prices, concerns about rising interest rates, and an unsettled
geopolitical environment adversely affected U.S. markets. The U.S. Federal
Reserve Board raised interest rates three times during the period, and this
appears to have set expectations for an ongoing series of modest
rate hikes.

CONTRIBUTORS TO RELATIVE PERFORMANCE

Strong security selection within the health care and utilities sectors was the
principal source of the fund's relative outperformance for the period relative
to its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. Our positioning
along the yield curve also helped boost relative results. Shorter-maturity
bonds experienced larger price declines than longer-maturity bonds over the
period. The trust's overweighted position in bonds with maturities in the 15-
to 20-year range, therefore, worked to its benefit as these bonds outperformed
shorter-maturity bonds. Our underweighted position in shorter-maturity bonds
also helped relative performance as that end of the curve underperformed
longer-maturity bonds.

In addition, the trust's relative performance was positively impacted by
credit quality. As a high-yield-oriented portfolio, the trust was overweighted
in "BBB"-rated bonds which are the lowest quality investment-grade issues. The
trust benefited as "BBB"-rated bonds outperformed higher-quality issues over
the period. In addition, the trust's positions in noninvestment-grade debt,
which is not held by the benchmark, also aided relative results.

DETRACTORS FROM RELATIVE PERFORMANCE

Duration - a measure of the trust's sensitivity to changes in interest rates -
detracted modestly from relative performance during the 12-month period. The
fund was slightly long in duration - i.e., more sensitive to interest rate
changes - relative to its benchmark. Our longer duration stance modestly hurt
performance, mainly during March and April of 2004, when rates rose sharply and
bond prices retreated.

INDEX DEFINITIONS

Lipper Closed End High Yield Municipal Index - an index composed of 10 closed-
end funds (including MFS Municipal Income Trust) that invests at least 50% of
their assets in lower rated municipal debt securities.

Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index - measures the municipal bond market.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset value.
When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value
underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive less
than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As a
result, the total return that is calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange price can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as
a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her shares
and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be treated as
gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of shareholder capital
have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and increasing the trust's
expense ratio.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

A portion of income may be subject to state, federal, and/or alternative
minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to a capital gains tax.

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The portfolio may invest in government guaranteed securities. These guarantees
apply to the underlying securities only and not to the prices and yields of the
portfolio.

Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities may provide greater returns
but are subject to greater-than-average risk.

The portfolio may invest a higher precentage of its assets in a small number of
issuers', the portfolio is more susceptible to any (non-diversified) single
economic, political or regulatory event affecting those issuers than is a
diversified fund.

The portfolio may focus in a limited number of states making it more
susceptible to adverse economic, political, or regulatory developments
affecting those states than a portfolio that invests more broadly.

The portfolio's value will fluctuate in response to market conditions and
issuer, regulatory, economic, or political developments. In general, fixed
income securities will decline when interest rates rise and will increase when
interest rates fall. Many fixed income securities also involve credit risk,
which is the risk that issuers may fail to make timely principal or interest
payments. In addition, fixed income securities with longer maturity dates will
be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter maturity
periods. Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other
risk considerations.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on such
terms as the Trustees shall determine.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price
of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.
Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in any amount
over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in
one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a
certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the trust's financial performance for the past 5 years.
Certain information reflects financial results for a single trust share. The total returns in the table represent the rate by
which an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the trust (assuming reinvestment of all distributions) held
for the entire period. This information has been audited by the trust's independent registered public accounting firm, whose
report, together with the trust's financial statements, are included in this report.

(S) As required, effective November 1, 2001, the trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
    Investment Companies and began accreting market discount on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended
    October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment income per share by $0.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
    losses per share by $0.01, and to increase the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by 0.07%. Per share,
    ratios, and supplemental data for periods prior to November 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    presentation.
  + Ratio excludes dividend payment on auction preferred shares.
 ++ Calculated by substracting the trust's total liabilities (not including preferred shares) from the trust's total assets
    and dividing this by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
  # Per share data are based on average shares outstanding.
 ## Ratios do not reflect reductions from fees paid indirectly.
  * As revised, to reflect transactions conducted prior to close, not included in closing activity on the NYSE at October 31,
    2002. Such amount was previously reported as (2.64)%. Additionally, for the year ended October 31, 2000, the total return
    previously reported was based on net asset value (5.20%).
 ** The reimbursement per share amount and ratios were less than $0.01 and 0.01%, respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is a non-diversified trust that is
organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management
investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield securities rated below
investment grade. Investments in high-yield securities involve greater degrees
of credit and market risk than investments in higher-rated securities and tend
to be more sensitive to economic conditions. Municipal securities backed by
current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can
be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the
projects or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from
the assets. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal
security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the
security could become taxable and the security could decline in value.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated bid
price as reported by an independent pricing service, or to the extent a
valuation is not reported by a pricing service, such securities are valued on
the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Short-term obligations with a remaining
maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied valuations.
All other short-term obligations in the trust's portfolio are valued at
amortized cost, which constitutes market value as determined by the Board of
Trustees. When pricing service information or market quotations are not readily
available, securities are priced at fair value as determined under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party, which is based
on a specific financial index. Cash payments are exchanged at specified
intervals and the expected income or expense is recorded on the accrual basis.
The value of the swap is adjusted daily and the change in value is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Risks may arise upon entering into
these agreements from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contract and from unanticipated changes in the value of the
financial index on which the swap agreement is based. The trust uses swaps for
both hedging and non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may use
swaps to reduce its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. For non-hedging purposes, the trust may use swaps to take a
position on anticipated changes in the underlying financial index.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - Interest rate swap agreements are agreements to
exchange cash flows periodically based on a notional principal amount, for
example the exchange of fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest
payments which are based on a specific financial index, or the exchange of two
distinct floating rate payments. The net receivable or payable associated with
these payments is accrued daily and is recorded as net interest income or
expense. For financial statement purposes, the net interest income or expense
periodically recognized for an interest rate swap is recorded in the same line
item as any unrealized and realized gains or losses recognized for that
instrument. The primary risk associated with interest rate swap agreements is
that unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest rates could adversely
impact the trust.

RATE LOCK SWAPS - The trust may enter into rate lock swaps, which are used to
reduce the interest rate risk of the portfolio. A rate lock swap is a payment
or receipt of cash on a specified future date, calculated as the difference
between the strike rate and a specific index yield on that date. The payment
received or made at the end of the measurement period is recorded as a realized
gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted
daily and the change in value is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and
original issue discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as
required by federal income tax regulations. Legal fees and other related
expenses incurred to preserve and protect the value of a security owned are
added to the cost of the security; other legal fees are expensed. Capital
infusions made directly to the security issuer, which are generally non-
recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of high-yield debt
securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the security. Costs
that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of capital infusions or
that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization are reported as
realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance an investment, or
costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the year ended October 31, 2004, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net tax-
exempt and taxable net income, including any net realized gain on investments.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.
Distributions paid by the trust from net interest received on tax-exempt
municipal bonds are not includable by shareholders as gross income for federal
income tax purposes because the trust intends to meet certain requirements of
the Code applicable to regulated investment companies, which will enable the
trust to pay exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any,
earned on private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986 may be considered
a tax-preference item to shareholders.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for defaulted bonds, capital losses, and amortization and accretion
on debt securities.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended October 31,
2004 and October 31, 2003 was as follows:

During the year ended October 31, 2004 accumulated undistributed net investment
income increased by $34,995, accumulated net realized loss on investments
decreased by $8,739,610, and paid-in capital decreased by $8,774,605 due to
differences between book and tax accounting for amortization and accretion on
debt securities, market discount, and capital losses. This change had no effect
on the net assets or net asset value per share.

As of October 31, 2004 the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

          Undistributed tax-exempt income                 $7,792,198
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Undistributed ordinary income                       60,086

against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration.

          ----------------------------------------------------------

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES - The trust issued 2,800 shares of Auction Preferred
Shares (APS), series T and 2,800 of Auction Preferred Shares (APS), series TH.
Dividends are cumulative at a rate that is reset every seven days for both
series through an auction process. During the year ended October 31, 2004 the
dividend rates ranged from 1.31% to 2.59%. The trust pays an annual fee
equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred share liquidation value for remarketing
efforts associated with the preferred auction. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the trust in whole or in part at the redemption price equal to
$25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The APS are also
subject to mandatory redemption if certain requirements relating to its asset
maintenance coverage are not satisfied. The trust is required to maintain
certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the trust's By-
Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

In accordance with the provisions of FASB 150, "Accounting for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity",
effective for the current period, the trust has reclassified its Auction
Preferred Shares ("APS") outside of permanent equity in the Net Assets section
of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, distributions to APS
shareholders are now classified as a component of the "Increase in net assets
from operations" on the Statement of Operations and Statement of Changes in Net
Assets and as a component of the "Total from investment operations" in the
Financial Highlights. Prior year amounts presented have been reclassified to
conform to this period's presentation. This change has no impact of the net
assets applicable to common shares of the trust.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the trust's average daily net assets and 6.32% of investment income. Management
fees incurred for the year ended October 31, 2004 were charged an effective
rate of 0.80% of average daily net assets, including preferred shares, on an
annualized basis.

The trust pays compensation to its Independent Trustees in the form of a
retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee
chairpersons, and pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are
officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the trust, all of whom
receive remuneration for their services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers
and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFS Service
Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded defined benefit plan for retired
Independent Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is a pension expense
of $10,611 for retired Independent Trustees for the year ended October 31,
2004.

This trust and certain other MFS funds (the "funds") have entered into a
services agreement (the "Agreement") which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. MFS has agreed to
reimburse each of the funds for a proportional share of substantially all of
the payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC and also to provide office
space and other administrative support and supplies to the ICCO. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement
of the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and
approval by the Board of Trustees. Each fund is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets.

Prior to April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the
following annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

          First $2 billion                                    0.0175%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                   0.0130%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                   0.0005%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          In excess of $7 billion                             0.0000%
          ----------------------------------------------------------

Effective April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the
following annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

          First $2 billion                                   0.01120%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                  0.00832%

          Next $2.5 billion                                  0.00032%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          In excess of $7 billion                            0.00000%
          ----------------------------------------------------------

For the year ended October 31, 2004, the trust paid MFS $41,070 equivalent to
0.00916% of average daily net assets including preferred shares, to partially
reimburse MFS for the costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$65,362 for the year ended October 31, 2004. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $2,567 for the year ended October 31, 2004, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. government securities,
purchased option transactions, and short-term obligations, aggregated

          Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)     $16,805,783
          ----------------------------------------------------------

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. During the year ended October 31, 2004, the trust did
not repurchase any shares. Transactions in trust shares were as follows:

                                     Year ended 10/31/04   Year ended 10/31/03

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal
Reserve funds rate plus 0.50%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the
average daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the year ended October 31, 2004 was $1,513, and is
included in miscellaneous expense. The trust had no significant borrowings
during the year ended October 31, 2004.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to market
risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These
financial instruments include swap agreements. The notional or contractual
amounts of these instruments represent the investment the trust has in
particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent
the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks
associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related and
offsetting transactions are considered.

(9) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

At October 31, 2004 17% of securities in the portfolio of investments are
backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of various financial institutions
and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The percentage of investments
insured by or supported (backed) by a letter of credit from any one institution
or agency did not exceed 8.5% of total investments.

(10) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage allocation
practices in connection with MFS fund sales (the term "MFS funds" means the
open-end registered management investment companies sponsored by MFS). Under
the terms of the settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor denied any
wrongdoing, MFS agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement and $50
million in penalty to certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan developed by an
independent distribution consultant. The brokerage allocation practices which
were the subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS in November 2003.
The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order of the SEC. Pursuant to the
SEC order, on July 28, 2004, MFS transferred these settlement amounts to the
SEC, and those MFS funds entitled to these settlement amounts accrued an
estimate of their pro rata portion of these amounts. Once the final
distribution plan is approved by the SEC, these amounts will be distributed by
the SEC to the affected MFS funds. The SEC settlement order states that MFS
failed to adequately disclose to the Boards of Trustees and to shareholders of
the MFS funds the specifics of its preferred arrangements with certain
brokerage firms selling MFS fund shares. The SEC settlement order states that
MFS had in place policies designed to obtain best execution of all MFS fund
trades. As part of the settlement, MFS retained an independent compliance
consultant to review the completeness of its current policies and practices
regarding disclosure to MFS fund trustees and to MFS fund shareholders of
strategic alliances between MFS or its affiliates and broker-dealers and other
financial advisers who support the sale of MFS fund shares.

In addition, in February, 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New
York Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the
State of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging
false and misleading information in certain MFS open-end retail fund ("MFS
retail funds") prospectuses regarding market timing and related matters (the
"February Settlements"). These regulators alleged that prospectus language for
certain MFS retail funds was false and misleading because, although the
prospectuses for those funds in the regulators' view indicated that they
prohibited market timing, MFS did not limit trading activity in 11 domestic
large cap stock, high grade bond and money market retail funds. MFS' former
Chief Executive Officer, John W. Ballen, and former President, Kevin R. Parke,
also reached agreement with the SEC in which they agreed to, among other terms,
monetary fines and temporary suspensions from association with any investment
adviser or registered investment company. Messrs. Ballen and Parke have
resigned their positions with, and will not be returning to, MFS and the MFS
funds. Under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS and the executives
neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain MFS retail funds, which
has been funded by MFS and of which $50 million is characterized as a penalty.
This pool will be distributed in accordance with a methodology developed by an
independent distribution consultant in consultation with MFS and the Board of
Trustees of the MFS retail funds, and acceptable to the SEC. MFS has further
agreed with NYAG to reduce its management fees in the aggregate amount of
approximately $25 million annually over the next five years, and not to
increase certain management fees during this period. MFS has also paid an
administrative fine to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will be used for
investor education purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was contributed
to the North American Securities Administrators Association's Investor
Protection Trust). In addition, under the terms of the February Settlements,
MFS is in the process of adopting certain governance changes and reviewing its
policies and procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc., MFS Service Center,
Inc., MFS Corporation Retirement Committee, Sun Life Financial Inc., various
MFS funds, certain current and/or former Trustees of these MFS funds, and
certain officers of MFS have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits
filed in federal and state courts. The lawsuits variously have been commenced
as class actions or individual actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed shares of the MFS funds during specified periods, as class
actions on behalf of participants in certain retirement plan accounts, or as
derivative actions on behalf of the MFS funds. The lawsuits relating to market
timing and related matters have been transferred to, and consolidated before,
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, as part of a
multi-district litigation of market timing and related claims involving several
other fund complexes (In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation (Alger,
Columbia, Janus, MFS, One Group, Putnam, Allianz Dresdner), No. 1:04-md-15863
(transfer began March 19, 2004)). The plaintiffs in these consolidated lawsuits
generally seek injunctive relief including removal of the named Trustees,
adviser and distributor, rescission of contracts and 12b-1 Plans, disgorgement
of fees and profits, monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and
costs and other equitable and declaratory relief. Four lawsuits alleging
improper brokerage allocation practices and excessive compensation are pending
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Forsythe
v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10584 (GAO) (March 25, 2004);
Eddings v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10764 (GAO) (April 15,
2004); Marcus Dumond, et al. v. Massachusetts Financial Servs. Co., et al., No.
04cv11458 (GAO) (May 4, 2004); and Koslow v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al.,
No. 04cv11019 (GAO) (May 20, 2004)). The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally
seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, recovery of fees, rescission of
contracts, an accounting, restitution, declaratory relief, equitable and/or
injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs. The various lawsuits generally
allege that some or all of the defendants (i) permitted or acquiesced in market
timing and/or late trading in some of the MFS funds, inadequately disclosed
MFS' internal policies concerning market timing and such matters, and received
excessive compensation as fiduciaries to the MFS funds, or (ii) permitted or
acquiesced in the improper use of fund assets by MFS to support the
distribution of MFS fund shares and inadequately disclosed MFS' use of fund
assets in this manner. The actions assert that some or all of the defendants
violated the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as well as fiduciary duties and other violations of common law. Insofar
as any of the actions is appropriately brought derivatively on behalf of any of
the MFS funds, any recovery will inure to the benefit of the MFS funds. The
defendants are reviewing the allegations of the multiple complaints and will
respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based on similar allegations may be
filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS has
established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of certain MFS retail funds for damages that they
allegedly sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of
the MFS retail funds, and transferred $50 million for distribution to affected
MFS funds to compensate those funds based upon the amount of brokerage
commissions allocated in recognition of MFS fund sales. It is not clear whether
these amounts will be sufficient to compensate shareholders for all of the
damage they allegedly sustained, whether certain shareholders or putative class
members may have additional claims to compensation, or whether the damages that
may be awarded in any of the actions will exceed these amounts. In the event
the MFS funds incur any losses, costs or expenses in connection with such
lawsuits, the Boards of Trustees of the affected MFS funds may pursue claims on
behalf of such funds against any party that may have liability to the funds in
respect thereof.

Review of these matters by the independent Trustees of the MFS funds and their
counsel is continuing. There can be no assurance that these regulatory actions
and lawsuits, or the adverse publicity associated with these developments, will
not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced sales of fund shares, or
other adverse consequences to the MFS funds.

While these developments relate to MFS and the MFS' open-end funds, there can
be no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated
with these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount
of the MFS closed-end fund shares or other adverse consequences.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Municipal Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of the MFS Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust"),
as of October 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations for the year
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five
years in the period then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of the
securities owned as of October 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS
Municipal Income Trust as of October 31, 2004, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

</TABLE>

*   This amount reflects the fees billed to MFS and MFS Related Entities for
    non-audit services relating directly to the operations and financial
    reporting of the Registrant (which services also related to the operations
    and financial reporting of other funds within the MFS Funds complex).

#   This amount reflects the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for non-audit
    services rendered to the Registrant and for non-audit services rendered to
    MFS and the MFS Related Entities.

(1) The fees included under "Audit-Related Fees" are fees related to assurance
    and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
    audit or review of financial statements, but not reported under "Audit
    Fees," including accounting consultations, agreed-upon procedure reports,
    attestation reports and comfort letters.

(2) The fees included under "Tax Fees" are fees associated with tax compliance,
    tax advice and tax planning, including services relating to the filing or
    amendment of federal, state or local income tax returns, regulated
    investment company qualification reviews and tax distribution and analysis.

(3) The fees included under "All Other Fees" are fees for products and services
    provided by Deloitte other than those reported under "Audit Fees",
    "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees."

For periods prior to May 6, 2003, the amounts shown above under "Audit-Related
Fees," "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" relate to permitted non-audit services
that would have been subject to pre-approval if the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules relating to pre-approval of non-audit services had been in
effect.

ITEM 4(E)(1):
Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and
non-audit related services: To the extent required by applicable law,
pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the Board is needed for all audit and
permissible non-audit services rendered to the Funds and all permissible
non-audit services rendered to MFS or MFS Related Entities if the services
relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant.
Pre-approval is currently on an engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event
pre-approval of such services is necessary between regular meetings of the Audit
Committee and it is not practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the next
regular meeting of the Audit Committee, pre-approval of such services may be
referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval; provided that the
Chair may not pre-approve any individual engagement for such services exceeding
$50,000 or multiple engagements for such services in the aggregate exceeding
$100,000 between such regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement
pre-approved by the Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall
be presented for ratification by the entire Audit Committee at its next
regularly scheduled meeting.

ITEM 4(E)(2):
None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and
All Other Fees paid by the Registrant and MFS Related Entities relating directly
to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant disclosed above were
approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after the start of the
engagement with respect to services other than audit review or attest services,
if certain conditions are satisfied).

ITEM 4(F):  Not applicable.

ITEM 4(H): The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the provision
by a Registrant's independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit
services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved by the
Committee (because such services were provided prior to the effectiveness of SEC
rules requiring pre-approval or because such services did not relate directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant) was compatible with
maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting
firm as the Registrant's principal auditors.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The Registrant has an Audit Committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The members of the Audit
Committee are Messrs. J. Atwood Ives, William J. Poorvu and J. Dale Sherratt and
Ms. Amy B. Lane.

ITEM 6.  SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

A schedule of investments of the Registrant is included as part of the report to
shareholders of the Registrant under Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment companies (the
"MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company ("MFS") have
delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for shares that are
owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting policies and
procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are set forth
below:
<PAGE>
                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

              SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, AS REVISED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2004

                  Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional
         Advisors, Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries
         (collectively, "MFS") have adopted proxy voting policies and
         procedures, as set forth below, with respect to securities owned by the
         clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser and has the power to
         vote proxies, including the registered investment companies sponsored
         by MFS, other than the MFS Union Standard Equity Fund (the "MFS
         Funds").

                  These policies and procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

A. VOTING GUIDELINES

1. GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what MFS
believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not in
the interests of any other party or in MFS' corporate interests, including
interests such as the distribution of MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k)
plans, and institutional relationships.

         MFS has carefully reviewed matters that in recent years have been
presented for shareholder vote by either management or shareholders of public
companies. Based on the guiding principle that all votes made by MFS on behalf
of its clients must be in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
interests of such clients, MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, which are
set forth below, that govern how MFS generally plans to vote on specific matters
presented for shareholder vote. In all cases, MFS will exercise its discretion
to vote these items in accordance with this guiding principle. These underlying
guidelines are simply that - guidelines. Each proxy item is considered on a
case-by-case basis, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and there
may be instances in which MFS may vote proxies in a manner different from these
guidelines.

         As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting position with
respect to similar proxy proposals made by various issuers. In addition, MFS
generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer are
held by multiple client accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are
gradations in certain types of proposals that might result in different voting
positions being taken with respect to the different proxy statements. There also
may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote that are not
clearly governed by the guidelines, such as proposed mergers and acquisitions.
Some items that otherwise would be acceptable will be voted against the
proponent when it is seeking extremely broad flexibility without offering a
valid explanation. MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines with
respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override is, in MFS' best
judgment, consistent with the guiding principle of voting proxies in the best
long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

         From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines and
regarding particular voting issues from its clients. Those comments are reviewed
and considered periodically, and these guidelines are reviewed each year with
MFS Equity Research Department management, the MFS Proxy Review Group and the
MFS Proxy Consultant and are revised as appropriate.

         These policies and procedures are intended to address any potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. MFS
shall be mindful of any and all potential material conflicts of interest that
could arise in the voting of these proxies, shall identify, analyze, document
and report on any such potential conflicts, and shall ultimately vote these
proxies in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
clients. The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring and reporting
on all potential conflicts of interest.

2. MFS' POLICY ON SPECIFIC ISSUES

         NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

         Managements have become increasingly creative and generous with
compensation programs involving common stock. The original stock option plans,
which called for the optionee to pay the money to exercise the option, are now
embellished with no risk benefits such as stock appreciation rights, the use of
unexercised options to "buy" stock, and restricted stock at bargain prices.

         Stock option plans are supposed to reward results rather than tenure,
so the use of restricted stock at bargain prices is not favored. In some cases,
restricted stock is granted to the recipient at deep discounts to fair market
value, sometimes at par value. The holder cannot sell for a period of years, but
in the meantime is able to vote and receive dividends. Eventually the
restrictions lapse and the stock can be sold.

         MFS votes against option programs for officers, employees or
non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee, that
give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit grants of restricted stock
at deep discounts to fair market value. MFS generally votes against stock option
plans that involve stock appreciation rights or the use of unexercised options
to "buy" stock.

         MFS opposes plans that provide unduly generous compensation for
officers, directors or employees, or could result in excessive dilution to other
shareholders. As a general guideline, MFS votes against stock option plans if
all such plans for a particular company involve potential dilution, in the
aggregate, of more than 15%.

         MFS votes in favor of stock option plans for non-employee directors as
long as they satisfy the requirements set forth above with respect to stock
option plans for employees. Stock option plans that include options for
consultants and other third parties not involved in the management of the
company generally are opposed by MFS.

         "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

         From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted proxy
proposals that would require shareholder approval of any severance packages for
executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in
favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder approval
of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a certain
percentage of such officer's annual compensation. When put to a vote, MFS votes
against very large golden parachutes.

         ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

         In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits capital
appreciation in a stock, including a possible takeover and any proposal that
protects management from action by shareholders. These types of proposals take
many forms, ranging from "poison pills" and "shark repellents" to board
classification and super-majority requirements.

         REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

         When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the
laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of corporate
reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of such
a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure. While MFS
generally votes in favor of management proposals that it believes are in the
best long-term economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a measure
if, for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.

         DILUTION

         There are many reasons for issuance of stock and most are legitimate.
As noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs", when a stock option
plan (either individually or when aggregated with other plans of the same
company) would substantially dilute the existing equity (e.g., by approximately
15% or more), MFS generally votes against the plan. In addition, MFS votes
against proposals where management is asking for authorization to issue common
or preferred stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because the
unexplained authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.

         CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder voting
results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports proposals that would
prevent management from having access to shareholder voting information that is
compiled by an independent proxy tabulation firm.

         INDEPENDENCE OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES THEREOF

         While MFS acknowledges the potential benefits of a company's inclusion
of directors who are "independent" from management, MFS generally opposes
shareholder proposals that would require that a majority (or a "super-majority")
of a company's board be comprised of "independent" directors. Such proposals
could inappropriately reduce a company's ability to engage in certain types of
transactions, could result in the exclusion of talented directors who are not
deemed "independent", or could result in the unnecessary addition of additional
"independent" directors to a company's board. However, in view of the special
role and responsibilities of various committees of a board of directors, MFS
supports proposals that would require that the Audit, Nominating and
Compensation Committees be comprised entirely of directors who are deemed
"independent" of the company.

         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         Recently, some shareholder groups have submitted proposals to limit the
non-audit activities of a company's audit firm. Some proposals would prohibit
the provision of any non-audit services (unless approved in advance by the full
board) whereas other proposals would cap non-audit fees so that such fees do not
exceed a certain percentage of the audit fees. MFS supports such shareholder
proposals that would cap non-audit fees at an amount deemed to be not excessive.

         BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS

         Best practices standards are rapidly evolving in the corporate
governance areas as a result of recent corporate failures, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and revised listing standards on major stock exchanges. MFS
generally support these changes. However, many issuers are not publicly
registered, are not subject to these enhanced listing standards or are not
operating in an environment that is comparable to that in the United States. In
reviewing proxy proposals under these circumstances, MFS votes for proposals
that enhance standards of corporate governance so long as we believe that --
within the circumstances of the environment within which the issuers operate -
the proposal is consistent with the best long-term economic interests of our
clients.

         FOREIGN ISSUERS - SHARE BLOCKING

         In accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign
companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period
beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the
meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the country in which a company is
domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the
meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the company.
While practices vary, in many countries the block period can be continued for a
longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later
date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to
have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in some countries shares
generally can be "unblocked" up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in
other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the
issuer's transfer agent). Due to these restrictions, MFS must balance the
benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the potentially serious
portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility to sell the
underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in countries with
potentially long block periods, the disadvantage of being unable to sell the
stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of
voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly, MFS generally
will not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual, significant vote.
Conversely, for companies domiciled in countries with very short block periods,
MFS generally will continue to cast votes in accordance with these policies and
procedures.

         SOCIAL ISSUES

         There are many groups advocating social change, and many have chosen
the publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for their agenda. Common among these
are resolutions requiring the corporation to refrain from investing or
conducting business in certain countries, to adhere to some list of goals or
principles (e.g., environmental standards) or to report on various activities.
MFS votes against such proposals unless their shareholder-oriented benefits will
outweigh any costs or disruptions to the business, including those that use
corporate resources to further a particular social objective outside the
business of the company or when no discernible shareholder economic advantage is
evident.

         The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of certain
clients subject to those laws are voted. For example, the General Laws of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts prohibit the investment of state funds, including
retirement system assets, in the following types of investments: (i) financial
institutions which directly or through any subsidiary have outstanding loans to
any individual or corporation engaged in manufacturing, distribution or sale of
firearms, munitions, rubber or plastic bullets, tear gas, armored vehicles or
military aircraft for use or deployment in any activity in Northern Ireland; or
(ii) any stocks, securities or obligations of any company so engaged.

         Because of these statutory restrictions, it is necessary when voting
proxies for securities held in Massachusetts public pension accounts to support
the purpose of this legislation. Thus, on issues relating to these or similar
state law questions, it may be necessary to cast ballots differently for these
portfolios than MFS might normally do for other accounts.

B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

1. MFS PROXY REVIEW GROUP

         The administration of these policies and procedures is overseen by the
MFS Proxy Review Group, which includes senior MFS Legal Department officers and
MFS' Proxy Consultant. The MFS Proxy Review Group:

         a. Reviews these policies and procedures at least annually and
            recommends any amendments considered to be necessary or advisable;

         b. Determines whether any material conflicts of interest exist with
            respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to override these
            guidelines and (ii) votes not clearly governed by these guidelines;
            and

         c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to time.

         The current MFS Proxy Consultant is an independent proxy consultant who
performs these services exclusively for MFS.

2. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. Any
attempt to influence MFS' voting on a particular proxy matter should be reported
to the MFS Proxy Review Group. The MFS Proxy Consultant will assist the MFS
Proxy Review Group in carrying out these responsibilities.

         In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these policies and
guidelines, no conflict of interest will be deemed to exist. In cases where (i)
MFS is considering overriding these policies and guidelines, or (ii) matters
presented for vote are not clearly governed by these policies and guidelines,
the MFS Proxy Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant will follow these
procedures:

         a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of
            significant current and potential (i) distributors of MFS Fund
            shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by MFS, and (iii) MFS
            institutional clients (the "MFS Significant Client List");

         b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS Significant
            Client List, then no material conflict of interest will be deemed to
            exist, and the proxy will be voted as otherwise determined by the
            MFS Proxy Review Group;

         c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant Client
            List, then the MFS Proxy Review Group will carefully evaluate the
            proposed votes in order to ensure that the proxy ultimately is voted
            in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of
            MFS' clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests; and

         d. For all potential material conflicts of interest identified under
            clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Review Group will document: the name
            of the issuer, the issuer's relationship to MFS, the analysis of the
            matters submitted for proxy vote, and the basis for the
            determination that the votes ultimately were cast in what MFS
            believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
            clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests.

         The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for creating and maintaining
the MFS Significant Client List, in consultation with MFS' distribution,
retirement plan administration and institutional business units. The MFS
Significant Client List will be reviewed and updated as necessary, but no less
frequently than quarterly.

3. GATHERING PROXIES

         Nearly all proxies received by MFS originate at Automatic Data
Processing Corp. ("ADP"). ADP and issuers send proxies and related material
directly to the record holders of the shares beneficially owned by MFS' clients,
usually to the client's custodian or, less commonly, to the client itself. Each
client's custodian is responsible for forwarding all proxy solicitation
materials to MFS (except in the case of certain institutional clients for which
MFS does not vote proxies). This material will include proxy cards, reflecting
the proper shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the record dates for such
shareholder meetings, and proxy statements, the issuer's explanation of the
items to be voted upon.

         MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an agreement
with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to which the Proxy
Administrator performs various proxy vote processing and recordkeeping functions
for MFS' Fund and institutional client accounts. The Proxy Administrator does
not make recommendations to MFS as to how to vote any particular item. The Proxy
Administrator receives proxy statements and proxy cards directly from various
custodians, logs these materials into its database and matches upcoming meetings
with MFS Fund and client portfolio holdings, which are input into the Proxy
Administrator's system by an MFS holdings datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy
Administrator system, ballots and proxy material summaries for the upcoming
shareholders' meetings of over 10,000 corporations are available on-line to
certain MFS employees, the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group
and most proxies can be voted electronically. In addition to receiving the hard
copies of materials relating to meetings of shareholders of issuers whose
securities are held by the Funds and/or clients, the ballots and proxy
statements can be printed from the Proxy Administrator's system and forwarded
for review.

4. ANALYZING PROXIES

         After input into the Proxy Administrator system, proxies which are
deemed to be completely routine (e.g., those involving only uncontested
elections of directors, appointments of auditors, and/or employee stock purchase
plans)(1) are automatically voted in favor by the Proxy Administrator without
being sent to either the MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review Group for
further review. Proxies that pertain only to merger and acquisition proposals
are forwarded initially to an appropriate MFS portfolio manager or research
analyst for his or her recommendation. All proxies that are reviewed by either
the MFS Proxy Consultant or a portfolio manager or analyst are then forwarded
with the corresponding recommendation to the MFS Proxy Review Group.(2)

- -------------------
(1) Proxies for foreign companies often contain significantly more voting items
    than those of U.S. companies. Many of these items on foreign proxies involve
    repetitive, non-controversial matters that are mandated by local law.
    Accordingly, there is an expanded list of items that are deemed routine (and
    therefore automatically voted in favor) for foreign issuers, including the
    following: (i) receiving financial statements or other reports from the
    board; (ii) approval of declarations of dividends; (iii) appointment of
    shareholders to sign board meeting minutes; (iv) the discharge of management
    and supervisory boards; and (v) approval of share repurchase programs.

(2) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained within a few business days prior to the
    shareholder meeting, the MFS Proxy Review Group will determine the vote in
    what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
    clients.

         Recommendations with respect to voting on non-routine issues are
generally made by the MFS Proxy Consultant in accordance with the policies
summarized under "Voting Guidelines," and all other relevant materials. His or
her recommendation as to how each proxy proposal should be voted is indicated on
copies of proxy cards, including his or her rationale on significant items.
These cards are then forwarded to the MFS Proxy Review Group.

         As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment analysts are
consulted and involved in developing MFS' substantive proxy voting guidelines,
but have little or no involvement in or knowledge of proxy proposals or voting
positions taken by MFS. This is designed to promote consistency in the
application of MFS' voting guidelines, to promote consistency in voting on the
same or similar issues (for the same or for multiple issuers) across all client
accounts, and to minimize or remove the potential that proxy solicitors,
issuers, and third parties might attempt to exert influence on the vote or might
create a conflict of interest that is not in what MFS believes to be the best
long-term economic interests of our clients. In limited, specific instances
(e.g., mergers), the MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review Group may
consult with or seek recommendations from portfolio managers or analysts. The
MFS Proxy Review Group would ultimately determine the manner in which all
proxies are voted.

         As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines when
such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the guiding
principle of voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
clients. Any such override of the guidelines shall be examined, explained and
reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies.

5. VOTING PROXIES

         After the proxy card copies are reviewed, they are voted electronically
through the Proxy Administrator's system. In accordance with its contract with
MFS, the Proxy Administrator also generates a variety of reports for the MFS
Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, and makes available on-line
various other types of information so that the MFS Proxy Review Group and the
MFS Proxy Consultant may monitor the votes cast by the Proxy Administrator on
behalf of MFS' clients.

C. MONITORING SYSTEM

         It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS' Proxy
Consultant to monitor the proxy voting process. As noted above, when proxy
materials for clients are received, they are forwarded to the Proxy
Administrator and are input into the Proxy Administrator's system. Additionally,
through an interface with the portfolio holdings database of MFS, the Proxy
Administrator matches a list of all MFS Funds and clients who hold shares of a
company's stock and the number of shares held on the record date with the Proxy
Administrator's listing of any upcoming shareholder's meeting of that company.

         When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that the date of
a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy Administrator representative
checks that the vote for MFS Funds and clients holding that security has been
recorded in the computer system. If a proxy card has not been received from the
client's custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the custodian requesting that
the materials be forward immediately. If it is not possible to receive the proxy
card from the custodian in time to be voted at the meeting, MFS may instruct the
custodian to cast the vote in the manner specified and to mail the proxy
directly to the issuer.

D. RECORDS RETENTION

         MFS will retain copies of these policies and procedures in effect from
time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports submitted to the Board of
Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds for a period of six years. Proxy
solicitation materials, including electronic versions of the proxy cards
completed by the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, together
with their respective notes and comments, are maintained in an electronic format
by the Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the MFS Proxy
Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group. All proxy voting materials and
supporting documentation, including records generated by the Proxy
Administrator's system as to proxies processed, the dates when proxies were
received and returned, and the votes on each company's proxy issues, are
retained for six years.

E. REPORTS

         MFS FUNDS

         Periodically, MFS will report the results of its voting to the Board of
Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These reports will include: (i)
a listing of how votes were cast; (ii) a review of situations where MFS did not
vote in accordance with the guidelines and the rationale therefor; (iii) a
review of the procedures used by MFS to identify material conflicts of interest;
and (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines and, as necessary or
appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect new developments in
corporate governance and other issues. Based on these reviews, the Trustees and
Managers of the MFS Funds will consider possible modifications to these policies
to the extent necessary or advisable.

         ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

         At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client who has
requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report specifies the
proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the
position taken with respect to each issue.

         Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party
other than the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable law)
because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to the
client.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase shares annually.
The notification to shareholders of the program is part of the semi-annual and
annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs begin on March 1st of
each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of shares that
may be purchased in each annual period (March 1 through the following February
28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the first day of the
plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of shares available for purchase for
the March 1, 2004 plan year are 3,966,928.

For the year ended October 31, 2004, no shares of the Registrant have been
repurchased pursuant to the plans described above.

ITEM 10.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Municipal Income Trust, Massachusetts Financial Services Company, 500 Boylston
Street, Boston, MA 02116, c/o , Jeffrey N. Carp, Secretary of the Trust.
Shareholder communications must be in writing and be signed by the shareholder
and identify the series of the Registrant to which they relate. Such
recommendations must be accompanied by the candidate's biographical and
occupational data (including whether the candidate would be an "interested
person" of the Registrant), a written consent of the candidate to be named as a
nominee and to serve as Trustee if elected, record and ownership information for
the recommending shareholder with respect to the series of the Registrant to
which the recommendation relates and a description of any arrangements or
understandings regarding recommendation of the candidate for consideration.

ITEM 11.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act) as conducted within
     90 days of the filing date of this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal
     financial officer and principal executive officer have concluded that those
     disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the
     material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on this

     forms.

(b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
     reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during

     Ethics attached hereto.

                                                                EXHIBIT 12(a)(1)

                                                     (as amended February, 2004)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the "Covered
Officers" each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

         o  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships;

         o  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Funds;

         o  compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
            and regulations;

         o  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o  accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer should
not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests and should
endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Covered Officer must:

         o  not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
            improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
            for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
            the detriment of the Fund; and

         o  not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o  service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o  running for political office;

         o  the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o  the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
            has current or prospective business dealings unless such
            entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
            as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
            of impropriety;

         o  any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
            banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
            principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
            thereof;

         o  a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
            ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o  Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
            disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o  each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
            or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
            and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o  each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
            her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
            employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
            full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
            reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
            in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o  it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
            standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
            regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o  upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
            becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
            or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o  annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
            with the requirements of the Code;

         o  annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
            or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
            Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
            Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
            employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
            potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o  notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
            Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or other
service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

       b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.

       information included in this report, fairly present in all material
       respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
       assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
       include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
       periods presented in this report;

    4. The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
       establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
       defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
       the registrant and have:

       a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

       b. evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

       c. disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that has materially
          affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

    5. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
       registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
       of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

       a. all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

       b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
