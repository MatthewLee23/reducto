PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period. The trust's adviser has waived or reimbursed fees and
expenses from time to time; absent such waivers/reimbursements the trust's
returns would have been lower.

The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based
statistical composite of Pennsylvania municipal bonds. The Index is unmanaged
and does not include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower
performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2008

MARKET CONDITIONS

The financial markets experienced significant volatility throughout the
six-month reporting period as many large banks and financial firms began writing
down mortgage-related losses, and liquidity and credit availability became even
more restricted. At the same time, the pace of economic growth began to slow,
with gross domestic product (GDP) growth measuring an anemic 0.6 percent for the
fourth quarter of 2007. As weaker economic data was released in the first
quarter of 2008, fears of recession grew and consumer confidence waned,
prompting investors to continue to seek out the relative safety of high-quality
Treasury securities over other sectors of the fixed income market.

The municipal bond market faced additional headwinds as various monoline bond
insurers experienced credit rating downgrades, which caused spreads to widen,
and the auction rate and variable rate markets deteriorated. As a result, the
municipal market underperformed Treasuries for the overall period, with
municipal bond prices reaching historically attractive levels relative to
Treasury bonds in the first quarter of 2008. While yields on short-dated
municipal securities declined, yields on intermediate- and long-dated securities
rose, leading to the steepest yield curve in the past four years as the spread
between one-year and 30-year maturities reached 343 basis points. After a record
year for new municipal bond issuance in 2007, the amount of new issues coming to
market in the first four months of 2008 declined by roughly nine percent versus
the same period one year earlier due in part to a drop in refunding issuance.
Municipal bond issuance by the state of Pennsylvania was down 16 percent.

The Federal Reserve (the "Fed") took various steps to ease the liquidity crisis
and boost the economy during the period. Not only did the Federal Open Market
Committee reduce the target federal funds rate from 4.50 percent to 2.00 percent
by the end of the period, but in an unprecedented move, the Fed granted primary
Treasury dealers (mostly brokerage firms) access to its discount window and
loosened its collateral requirements, extending loans of Treasury securities in
exchange for lower quality, less liquid securities. Finally, in the biggest
headline event, the Fed arranged and supported JPMorgan Chase's purchase of Bear
Stearns, which was viewed by many as necessary to avoid serious market
repercussions had the firm failed.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the Trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On both an NAV basis and a market price basis, the Trust underperformed
its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and Trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

Although the municipal market rebounded in the last two months of the reporting
period and outperformed Treasuries, it was an extremely difficult period
overall, particularly for higher-yielding, lower-rated bonds as the flight to
quality put considerable pressure on prices. The Trust held an overweight
relative to the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index in BBB rated
securities, many of which were in the health care sector, which suffered from
spread widening during the reporting period. As a result, the Trust's overweight
to these lower-rated securities was a primary contributor to its relative
underperformance.

The Trust's yield curve positioning also hindered performance, as it was
overweighted on the long end of the municipal yield curve, which underperformed
the shorter end of the curve. The negative impact was amplified somewhat by
holdings in longer-maturity inverse floating-rate securities,* which are highly
sensitive to interest rate changes. However, these securities did serve to
enhance the Trust's income and diversification during the period. Additionally,
the emphasis on the long end of the curve led to a longer duration (a measure of
interest-rate sensitivity) for the Trust, which we reduced somewhat through the
use of a Treasury futures hedge. However, the Trust still maintained a slightly
longer duration than that of Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index,
which detracted from performance as rates

*An inverse floating-rate security, or "inverse floater", is a variable rate
security whose coupon rate changes in the opposite direction from the change in
the reference rate used to calculate the coupon rate.
                                                                               3
<PAGE>

on the intermediate and long end of the curve rose. At the same time, the
Treasury market rally hurt the performance of the hedge.

Conversely, a significant overweight to pre-refunded bonds was additive to
performance. These high-quality, shorter-maturity issues benefited as short-term
rates declined during the period. The Trust's overweight to higher-yielding
municipal auction rate securities (ARS) with low durations was also beneficial
to performance.

The Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when appropriate,
repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is lower at the time or
purchase. This may help support the market value of the trust's shares.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended, but operates as a
diversified management investment company. The Trust's investment objective is
to seek to provide a high level of current income exempt from federal and
Pennsylvania income taxes and, where possible under local law, local income and
personal property taxes, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust will
invest substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania municipal securities
rated investment grade at the time of investment, but may invest up to 20% of
its assets in unrated securities which are believed to be of comparable quality
to those rated investment grade. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the last reported bid and asked prices or, in the
absence of market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to
municipal bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions.
Securities which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are
valued at fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of
Trustees. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each
day on the exchange on which they are traded. Interest rate swaps are valued
using market quotations obtained from brokers. Short-term securities with
remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At April 30, 2008, the Trust had $1,000,000 of when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Trust adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48")

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on April 30, 2008. FIN 48 sets forth
a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The implementation of
FIN 48 did not result in any unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying
financial statements. If applicable, the Trust recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Interest Expense" and penalties in
"Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust files tax returns
with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and various states. Generally, each of
the tax years in the four year period ended October 31, 2007, remains subject to
examination by taxing authorities.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized capital
gains. At October 31, 2007, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carry
forward for tax purposes of $2,674,205 which will expire on October 31, 2015.

    At April 30, 2008, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were as follows:

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually on a pro rata basis to common and
preferred shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes
may include short-term capital gains and a portion of futures gains which are
included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October 31,
2007 were as follows:

<Table>

    As of October 31, 2007, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $   35,396
Undistributed tax-exempt income.............................   1,252,843

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of gains or losses recognized on securities for
tax purposes but not for book purposes.

                                                                              23

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

F. FLOATING RATE NOTE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SECURITIES HELD The Trust enters
into transactions in which it transfers to dealer trusts fixed rate bonds in
exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trusts' assets and cash
flows, which are in the form of inverse floating rate investments. The dealer
trusts fund the purchases of the fixed rate bonds by issuing floating rate notes
to third parties and allowing the Trust to retain residual interests in the
bonds. The Trust enters into shortfall agreements with the dealer trusts, which
commit the Trust to pay the dealer trusts, in certain circumstances, the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed rate bonds held by the
dealer trusts and the liquidation value of the floating rate notes held by third
parties, as well as any shortfalls in interest cash flows. The residual
interests held by the Trust (inverse floating rate investments) include the
right of the Trust (1) to cause the holders of the floating rate notes to tender
their notes at par at the next interest rate reset date, and (2) to transfer the
municipal bond from the dealer trusts to the Trust, thereby collapsing the
dealer trusts. The Trust accounts for the transfer of bonds to the dealer trusts
as secured borrowings, with the securities transferred remaining in the Trust's
investment assets, and the related floating rate notes reflected as Trust
liabilities under the caption "Floating Rate Note Obligations" on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust records the interest income from the fixed
rate bonds under the caption "Interest" and records the expenses related to
floating rate note obligations and any administrative expenses of the dealer
trusts under the caption "Interest and Residual Trust Expenses" on the Trust's
Statement of Operations. The notes issued by the dealer trusts have interest
rates that reset weekly and the floating rate note holders have the option to
tender their notes to the dealer trusts for redemption at par at each reset
date. At April 30, 2008, Trust investments with a value of $68,877,132 are held
by the dealer trusts and serve as collateral for the $49,930,000 in floating
rate notes outstanding at that date. Contractual maturities of the floating rate
notes and interest rates in effect at April 30, 2008 are presented on the
Portfolio of Investments. The average floating rate notes outstanding and
average annual interest fee rate related to residual interests during the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2008 were $89,612,143 and 3.152%, respectively.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
including preferred shares of the Trust. The Adviser has agreed to waive
investment advisory fees equal to .10% of the average daily net assets including
preferred shares of the Trust. During the six months ended April 30, 2008, the
Adviser waived $282,143 of its advisory fees. This waiver is voluntary and can
be discontinued at any time.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $17,100 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the six months ended April 30,
2008, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $37,600 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates'

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

(collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing accounting and legal services to
the Trust, as well as the salary, benefits and related costs of the CCO and
related support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the
Legal Services agreement are reported as part of "Professional Fees" on the
Statement of Operations. Services provided pursuant to the Accounting Services
and CCO Employment agreement are reported as part of "Accounting and
Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

For the six months ended April 30, 2008 and the year ended October 31, 2007,
transactions in common shares were as follows:

</Table>

*   On February 28, 2007, the Trust commenced a share repurchase program for
    purposes of enhancing stockholder value and reducing the discount at which
    the Trust's shares trade from their net asset value. For the six months
    ended April 30, 2008 and the year ended October 31, 2007, the Trust
    repurchased 310,775 and 345,950, respectively of its shares at an average
    discount of 8.76% and 7.93% respectively from net asset value per share. The
    Trust expects to continue to repurchase its outstanding shares at such time
    and in such amounts as it believes such activity will further the
    accomplishment of the foregoing objectives, subject to review of the
    Trustees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $73,103,408 and $151,524,039,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or
fixed-income market changes, for duration management or for risk management
purposes, but may also enter into these transactions to generate additional
income. All of the Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments,
are marked to market each day with the

                                                                              25

change in value reflected in the unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Upon
disposition, a realized gain or loss is recognized accordingly, except when
taking delivery of a security underlying a futures contract. In these instances,
the recognition of gain or loss is postponed until the disposal of the security
underlying the futures contract.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in exchange traded futures contracts on U.S. Treasury
securities and typically closes the contract prior to the delivery date. These
contracts are generally used to manage the Trust's effective maturity and
duration. Upon entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of
cash or liquid securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract
amount with either a futures commission merchant pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, as amended, or with its custodian in
an account in the broker's name. This amount is known as initial margin. During
the period the futures contract is open, payments are received from or made to
the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the variation
margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in excess of the
variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

    Transactions in futures contracts for the six months ended April 30, 2008
were as follows:

</Table>

B. INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Trust may enter into forward interest rate swap
transactions intended to help the Trust manage its overall interest rate
sensitivity, either shorter or longer, generally to more closely align the
Trust's interest rate sensitivity with that of the broader municipal market.
Forward interest rate swap transactions involve the Trust's agreement with a
counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or variable rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty paying the Trust a variable or fixed rate payment, the
accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the future (the "effective
date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on the notional amount of
the forward swap contract and the termination date of the swap (which is akin to
a bond's maturity). The value of the Trust's swap commitment would increase or
decrease based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swap's termination date increases or decreases.
The Trust may terminate a swap contract prior to the effective date, at which
point a realized gain or loss is recognized. When a forward swap is terminated,
it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying
assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis. The Trust
intends, but is not obligated, to terminate its forward swaps before the
effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap
counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with
a counterparty

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the Trust upon
termination. To reduce such credit risk, all counterparties are required to
pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of
the Trust with a value approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain.
Reciprocally, when the Trust has an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the
Trust has instructed the custodian to pledge cash or liquid securities as
collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized
loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the
swap valuations fluctuate. Restricted cash for segregating purposes, if any, is
shown on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

C. INVERSE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS The Trust may invest a portion of its
assets in inverse floating rate instruments, either through outright purchases
of inverse floating rate securities or through the transfer of bonds to a dealer
trust in exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trust. These
investments are typically used by the Trust in seeking to enhance the yield of
the portfolio. These instruments typically involve greater risks than a fixed
rate municipal bond. In particular, these instruments are acquired through
leverage or may have leverage embedded in them and therefore involve many of the
risks associated with leverage. Leverage is a speculative technique that may
expose the Trust to greater risk and increased costs. Leverage may cause the
Trust's net asset value to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged
because leverage tends to magnify the effect of any increases or decreases in
the value of the Trust's portfolio securities. The use of leverage may also
cause the Trust to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous
to do so in order to satisfy its obligations with respect to inverse floating
rate instruments.

6. PREFERRED SHARES

As of April 30, 2008, the Trust has outstanding 8,800 Auction Preferred Shares
(APS). Series A contains 1,800 shares, Series B contains 1,600 shares, Series C
contains 2,600 shares, and Series D contains 2,800 shares. Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every 7 days for Series A,
while Series B, Series C, and Series D are generally reset every 28 days through
an auction process. Beginning on February 13, 2008 and continuing through April
30, 2008, all series of preferred shares of the Trust were not successfully
remarketed. As a result, the dividend rates of these preferred shares were reset
to the maximum applicable rate on APS. The average rate in effect on April 30,
2008 was 3.286%. During the six months ended April 30, 2008, the rates ranged
from 2.681% to 5.200%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

                                                                              27

8. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of April 30, 2008, the Adviser does not believe the adoption of
SFAS 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements, however,
additional disclosures will be required about the inputs used to develop the
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported on
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.

    On March 19, 2008, Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires qualitative
disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative
instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in
derivative agreements. The application of SFAS 161 is required for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. At this time, management
is evaluating the implications of SFAS 161 and its impact on the financial
statements has not yet been determined.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On June 13, 2008, the Trust announced plans for the partial redemption of its
preferred shares. The Trust intends to redeem 20% of each of its Series per the
table below. The Board of Trustees previously approved the use of tender option
bonds as a replacement source of funding. The Depository Trust Company, the
securities' holder of record, will determine how the partial series redemptions
will be allocated among each participant broker-dealer account.
