SALOMON BROTHERS CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND INC.


LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[PHOTO]

R. Jay Gerken
R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman and President

Dear Shareholder,

On behalf of everyone at Salomon Brothers Asset Management, I would like to
extend a warm welcome to you as a shareholder of the new Salomon Brothers
Capital and Income Fund. The stewardship of your fund is a responsibility we
take very seriously and we will work diligently to seek to achieve the fund's
investment goals. Thank you again for your confidence in our investment
management capabilities.

This is the first of two shareholder reports that we will send to you each year
detailing the economic and financial markets environment, the fund's investment
strategy and how it affected performance, and what, if any, changes we are
making in anticipation of the market outlook. We encourage you to read these
reports carefully to monitor the fund's progress. Also, you can obtain updates
about your fund through our www.sbam.com website.

Performance Review

Since its inception date on February 24, 2004 through the end of April, the
Salomon Brothers Capital and Income Fund returned -12.50% based on its New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") market price and -3.31% based on its net asset value
("NAV")/i/ per share. Please note this fund performance is based upon only a
two-month period./1/ Due to the recent launch of the fund, future annual and
semi-annual reports will cover the full 6-month and 12-month periods for which
the reports are issued.

We've recently seen a lot of volatility in the closed-end market due to the
impact of the rise in interest rates and expectations for an additional
increase. Your fund, like many of its closed-end competitors, has been
negatively affected by this broad shift in investor sentiment. Periodic bouts
of volatility such as this recent episode are not uncommon in the closed-end
market. We remain fully confident in the fund's investment strategy and program.

Market Review

Over the last six months, most broad U.S. stock and bond market indexes posted
moderate gains. Stocks generally continued to outpace bonds, with
large-capitalization stocks typically outperforming small- and mid-cap stocks
and international stock markets generally outperforming the domestic stock
market. The economic environment was dominated by uncertainty surrounding the
sustainability of the domestic economic recovery, a continued focus on new job
growth and a geopolitical environment centering on news from Iraq and new acts
of terrorism.

Since the start of 2004, markets have been in a holding pattern--volatility
declined, and returns were relatively muted. Equity markets seem to have priced
in prospects of continued economic recovery and, in general, they were not
disappointed. Both bond market and stock market participants were a bit


/1/Please note that in accordance with its prospectus, the fund did not yet pay
  a dividend during the time period of February 24, 2004 (fund's inception
  date) to April 30, 2004 (end of reporting period). During the period of this
  report, the fund did declare that it would pay dividends on May 28, 2004. The
  fund's price per share as of April 30, 2004 was $18.43 (NAV) and $17.50
  (NYSE) market price. The fund's 30-day SEC yield for its NAV price was 2.71%
  and for its NYSE- market price, it was 2.86%, as of April 30, 2004.

unnerved by prospects for U.S. Federal Reserve tightening of key interest rates
at some unknown future date, the continuing turmoil in Iraq, and the March 2004
bombings in Spain. Each of these elements had a negative influence on the stock
market. Despite these concerns, however, the underlying economic and corporate
earnings picture continued to improve through the end of April.

So far this year, the economy overall has appeared to be growing at a pace
similar to last year's rate. The ongoing recovery has been broad-based, with
strength in the consumer sector, exports and business investments. Soaring
corporate profit growth has led to vastly improved balance-sheet fundamentals
in general, while highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policy continued to
provide support, although the stimulative effects of fiscal policy could wane
after tax-refund season ends this spring. Following a period of mixed
employment news through the end of last year, job growth picked up
substantially in the first calendar quarter of 2004.

Signs of increasing inflation have begun to mount in recent weeks. Fiscal and
monetary policymakers have been stimulating the economy since 2000. The Fed has
more or less said it prefers inflation to deflation in the current environment.
However, we believe the recent pick-up in inflationary signals has increased
the possibility that the Fed may raise interest rates sooner than anticipated,
perhaps as early as this summer. Accordingly, the recent debate in the market
has focused on the timing and magnitude of prospective rate increases.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

Looking for Additional Information?

The fund is traded under the symbol "SCD" and its closing market price is
available in most newspapers under the NYSE listings. The daily NAV is
available online under symbol XSCDX. Barron's and The Wall Street Journal's
Monday editions carry closed-end fund tables that will provide additional
information. In addition, the fund issues a quarterly press release that can be
found on most major financial websites as well as www.sbam.com.

In a continuing effort to provide information concerning the fund, shareholders
may call 1-888-777-0102 or 1-800-SALOMON (toll free), Monday through Friday
from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time, for the fund's current NAV, market
price and other information.

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of April 30, 2004 and are subject to
change. Please refer to pages 4 through 20 for a list and percentage breakdown
of the fund's holdings.

RISKS:
Like any investment where there is risk loss, you may not be able to sell the
shares for the same amount that you purchased them. The fund may use
derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may
disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on fund
performance. Leverage may magnify gains and increase losses in the fund's
portfolio.

/i/NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio
   plus other assets, less the fund's liabilities. However, the price at which
   an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund is at the fund's market price
   as determined by supply of and demand for the fund's common shares, which
   may be more or less than the fund's NAV.

SALOMON BROTHERS CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Salomon Brothers Capital and Income Fund Inc. ("Fund") was incorporated in
Maryland and is registered as a non-diversified, closed-end, management
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Fund seeks total return with an emphasis on income by investing primarily in a
portfolio consisting of a broad range of equity and fixed income securities of
both U.S. and foreign issuers.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were sales on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there was no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

(c) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Portfolio securities and other assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar
amounts at the date of valuation using the 12:00 noon rate of exchange reported
by Reuters. Purchases and sales of portfolio securities and income

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)

and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S.
dollars at rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses
realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amount actually received. The Fund does not isolate that portion of
gains and losses on investments which is due to changes in foreign exchange
rates from that which is due to changes in market prices of the securities.
Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or
loss from investments. However, pursuant to U.S. Federal income tax
regulations, certain net foreign exchange gains/losses included in realized
gain/loss are included in or are a reduction of ordinary income for Federal
income tax purposes.

(d) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated
investment companies, and to distribute all of its income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(e) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed at least annually.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets.

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy that a custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral
securities, the value of which at least equals the principal amount of the
repurchase transaction, including accrued interest. To the extent that any
repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is
marked-to-market to ensure the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller
defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings
are commenced with respect to the seller of the security, realization of the
collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

(g) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from GAAP.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

a day-to-day basis for the management of the Fund's portfolio in accordance
with the Fund's investment objectives and policies and for making decisions to
buy, sell or hold particular securities of the Fund. The management fee for
these services is payable monthly at an annual rate of 0.85% of the Fund's
average daily net assets (plus any borrowings).

At April 30, 2004, Citigroup Financial Products Inc., another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, held 5,246.59 shares of the Fund.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
directors of SBAM.

NOTE 3. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

During the period ended April 30, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

At April 30, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation
of investments for Federal income tax purposes were substantially as follows:

          Gross unrealized depreciation................  (26,393,203)

          Net unrealized depreciation.................. $(22,885,742)
                                                        ============
</TABLE>

NOTE 4. OPTION CONTRACTS

Premiums paid when put or call options are purchased by the Fund, represent
investments, which are marked-to-market daily and are included in the schedules
of investments. When a purchased option expires, the Fund will realize a loss
in the amount of the premium paid. When the Fund enters into a closing sales
transaction, the Fund will realize a gain or loss depending on whether the
proceeds from the closing sales transaction are greater or less than the
premium paid for the option. When the Fund exercises a put option, it will
realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security and the
proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium originally paid. When
the Fund exercises a call option, the cost of the security which the Fund
purchases upon exercise will be increased by the premium originally paid.

At April 30, 2004, the Fund held purchased put option contracts with a total
cost of $1,261,500.

When the Fund writes a covered call or put option, an amount equal to the
premium received by the Fund is recorded as a liability, the value of which is
marked-to-market daily. When a written option expires, the Fund realizes a
gain. When the Fund enters into a closing purchase transaction, the Fund
realizes a gain or loss depending upon whether the cost of the closing

Page 26

SALOMON BROTHERS CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)

transaction is greater or less than the premium originally received without
regard to any unrealized gain or loss on the underlying security, and the
liability related to such option is eliminated. When a written call option is
exercised, the cost of the security sold will be decreased by the premium
originally received. When a written put option is exercised, the amount of the
premium originally received will reduce the cost of the security which the Fund
purchased upon exercise. When written index options are exercised, settlement
is made in cash. The risk associated with purchasing options is limited to the
premium originally paid. The Fund enters into options contracts for hedging
purposes. The risk in writing a covered call option is that the Fund gives up
the opportunity to participate in any increase in the price of the underlying
security beyond the exercise price. The risk in writing a put option is that
the Fund is exposed to the risk of loss if the market price of the underlying
security declines. The risk in writing a put option is that the Fund is exposed
to the risk of loss if the market price of the underlying security increases.

During the period ended April 30, 2004, the Fund did not enter into any written
covered call or put option contracts.

NOTE 5. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower,
and the Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, the Fund will assume
the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the
participation. In the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the
participation, the Fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and
may not benefit from any set-off between the lender and the borrower.

At April 30, 2004, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$3,410,683.

NOTE 6. CREDIT RISK

The yields of emerging market debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

                                                                        Page 27

NOTE 7. FOREIGN SECURITIES

Investing in securities of foreign companies and foreign governments involves
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in
U.S. companies and the U.S. government. These risks include revaluation of
currencies and future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover,
securities of many foreign companies and foreign governments and their markets
may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of securities of
comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.

NOTE 8. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO APRIL 30, 2004

On April 19, 2004, the Board of Directors ("Board") of the Fund declared a
dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share, payable on May 28, 2004 to
shareholders of record on May 18, 2004.

In addition, on May 14, 2004, the Fund's Board declared three dividends, each
in the amount of $0.10 per share, payable on June 25, 2004, July 30, 2004, and
August 27, 2004 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2004, July 13, 2004, and
August 17, 2004, respectively.

NOTE 9. CAPITAL SHARES

On May 14, 2004, the Fund's Board authorized the Fund to repurchase from time
to time in the open market up to 1,000,000 shares of the Fund's common stock.
The Board directed the management of the Fund to repurchase shares of the
Fund's common stock at such times and in such amounts as management believes
will enhance shareholder value, subject to review by the Fund's Board. Since
the inception of the repurchase plan, the Fund has not repurchased any shares.

NOTE 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue
guarantee agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor
would guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue
Guarantee Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the
sub-contractor's business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent
(PFPC Inc.) used by CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee
Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

Page 28

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (continued)


The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
approximately $17 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received
from the Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. The Fund did not
implement the contractual arrangement described above and therefore will not
receive any portion of the payment. CAM also plans an independent review to
verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were fairly priced as
compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new procedures and
making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are entered into in
the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, which is
not affiliated with CAM or PFPC Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Unless you elect to receive distributions in cash, all dividends, including any
capital gain dividends, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested
by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as agent for the Common
Shareholders (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). You may elect not to participate in the Plan by
contacting the Plan Agent. If you do not participate, you will receive all cash
distributions paid by check mailed directly to you by American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company as dividend paying agent.

If you participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will receive
will be determined as follows:

(1) If the market price of the Common Shares on the record date (or, if the
record date is not a New York Stock Exchange trading day, the immediately
preceding trading day) for determining shareholders eligible to receive the
relevant dividend or distribution (the "determination date") is equal to or
exceeds the net asset value per share of the Common Shares, the Fund will issue
new Common Shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) the net asset value
per share at the close of trading on the Exchange on the determination date or
(b) 95% of the market price per share of the Common Shares on the determination
date.

(2) If the net asset value per share of the Common Shares exceeds the market
price of the Common Shares on the determination date, the Plan Agent will
receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will buy Common Shares in the
open market, on the Exchange or elsewhere, for your account as soon as
practicable commencing on the trading day following the determination date and
terminating no later than the earlier of (a) 30 days after the dividend or
distribution payment date, or (b) the record date for the next succeeding
dividend or distribution to be made to the Common Shareholders; except when
necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.
If during this period: (i) the market price rises so that it equals or exceeds
the net asset value per share of the Common Shares at the close of trading on
the Exchange on the determination date before the Plan Agent has completed the
open market purchases or (ii) if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
amount eligible to be reinvested in open market purchases, the Plan Agent will
cease purchasing Common Shares in the open market and the Fund shall issue the
remaining Common Shares at a price per share equal to the greater of (a) the
net asset value per share at the close of trading on the Exchange on the
determination date or (b) 95% of the then current market price per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all participants' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all
Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

You may withdraw from the Plan by notifying the Plan Agent in writing at 59
Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038. Such withdrawal will be effective
immediately if notice is received by the

                                                                        Page 31

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND INC.



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Plan Agent not less than ten business days prior to any dividend or
distribution record date; otherwise such withdrawal will be effective as soon
as practicable after the Plan Agent's investment of the most recently declared
dividend or distribution on the Common Shares. The Plan may be terminated by
the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to Common Shareholders at least 30 days
prior to the record date for the payment of any dividend or distribution by the
Fund for which the termination is to be effective. Upon any termination, you
will be sent a certificate or certificates for the full Common Shares held for
you under the Plan and cash for any fractional Common Shares. You may elect to
notify the Plan Agent in advance of such termination to have the Plan Agent
sell part or all of your shares on your behalf. The Plan Agent is authorized to
deduct brokerage charges actually incurred for this transaction from the
proceeds.

There is no service charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases. Because all dividends and distributions will be automatically
reinvested in additional Common Shares, this allows you to add to your
investment through dollar cost averaging, which may lower the average cost of
your Common Shares over time.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, the change is warranted. There is no direct service
charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to
amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.
Additional information about the Plan and your account may be obtained from the
Plan Agent at 59 Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038.

ITEM 7.           DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-
                  END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                  The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority
                  to develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to
                  the Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management
                  ("CAM"), a group of investment adviser affiliates of
                  Citigroup, Inc. ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment
                  advisers that comprise CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of
                  proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") to
                  ensure that the Manager votes proxies relating to equity
                  securities in the best interest of clients.

                  In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
                  principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best
                  interest of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all
                  factors that could affect the value of the investment and will
                  vote proxies in the manner that it believes will be consistent
                  with efforts to maximize shareholder values. The Manager may
                  utilize an external service provider to provide it with
                  information and/or a recommendation with regard to proxy
                  votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
                  Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

                  In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated
                  position in the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance
                  with such stated position. In the case of a proxy issue for
                  which there is a list of factors set forth in the Policies
                  that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
                  case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles
                  set forth above and considering such enumerated factors. In
                  the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated
                  position or list of factors that CAM considers in voting on
                  such issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance
                  with the general principles set forth above. Issues for which
                  there is a stated position set forth in the Policies or for
                  which there is a list of factors set forth in the Policies
                  that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall into a
                  variety of categories, including election of directors,
                  ratification of auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses,
                  capital structure issues, executive and director

<PAGE>

                  compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and
                  social and environmental issues. The stated position on an
                  issue set forth in the Policies can always be superseded,
                  subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of
                  the beneficial owners of accounts, by the investment
                  management professionals responsible for the account whose
                  shares are being voted. Issues applicable to a particular
                  industry may cause CAM to abandon a policy that would have
                  otherwise applied to issuers generally. As a result of the
                  independent investment advisory services provided by
                  distinct CAM business units, there may be occasions when
                  different business units or different portfolio managers
                  within the same business unit vote differently on the same
                  issue.

                  In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the
                  best interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures
                  designed to identify and address material conflicts that may
                  arise between the Manager's interests and those of its clients
                  before voting proxies on behalf of such clients. To seek to
                  identify conflicts of interest, CAM periodically notifies CAM
                  employees (including employees of the Manager) in writing that
                  they are under an obligation (i) to be aware of the potential
                  for conflicts of interest with respect to voting proxies on
                  behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
                  relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise
                  during the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and
                  (ii) to bring conflicts of interest of which they become aware
                  to the attention of compliance personnel. The Manager also
                  maintains and considers a list of significant relationships
                  that could present a conflict of interest for the Manager in
                  voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the fact that
                  a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and a
                  non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the
                  manner in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with
                  respect to such issuer. Absent special circumstances or a
                  significant, publicized non-CAM affiliate relationship that
                  CAM or the Manager for prudential reasons treats as a
                  potential conflict of interest because such relationship might
                  appear to the public to influence the manner in which the
                  Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
                  the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and
                  an issuer (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present
                  a conflict of interest for the Manager in voting proxies with
                  respect to such issuer. Such position is based on the fact
                  that the Manager is operated as an independent business unit
                  from other Citigroup business units as well as on the
                  existence of information barriers between the Manager and
                  certain other Citigroup business units.

                  CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager
                  personnel are members, to review and address conflicts of
                  interest brought to its attention by compliance personnel. A
                  proxy issue that will be voted in accordance with a stated
                  position on an issue or in accordance with the recommendation
                  of an independent third party is not brought to the attention
                  of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest
                  review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a
                  conflict of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in
                  accordance with a pre-determined policy or in accordance with
                  the recommendation of an independent third party. With respect
                  to a conflict of interest brought to its attention, the

<PAGE>

                  Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether such
                  conflict of interest is material. A conflict of interest is
                  considered material to the extent that it is determined that
                  such conflict is likely to influence, or appear to
                  influence, the Manager's decision-making in voting proxies. If
                  it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a
                  conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote
                  proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

                  If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a
                  conflict of interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee
                  is responsible for determining an appropriate method to
                  resolve such conflict of interest before the proxy affected by
                  the conflict of interest is voted. Such determination is based
                  on the particular facts and circumstances, including the
                  importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the conflict
                  of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
                  interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the
                  conflict to clients and obtaining their consent before voting,
                  or suggesting to clients that they engage another party to
                  vote the proxy on their behalf.

ITEM 8.           [RESERVED]

ITEM 9.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

                  (a)  The registrant's principal executive officer and
                       principal financial officer have concluded that the
                       registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as
                       defined in Rule 30a- 3(c) under the Investment Company
                       Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) are effective
                       as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this
                       report that includes the disclosure required by this
                       paragraph, based on their evaluation of the disclosure
                       controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under
                       the 1940 Act and 15d-15(b) under the Securities
                       Exchange Act of 1934.

                  (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal
                       control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
                       30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that occurred during the
                       registrant's last fiscal half-year (the registrant's
                       second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                       report) that have materially affected, or are likely to
                       materially affect the registrant's internal control
                       over financial reporting.

ITEM 10.          EXHIBITS.
