PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Market volatility can
significantly impact short-term performance. Results of an investment made today
may differ substantially from the Fund's historical performance. Investment
return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's interests, when
redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Members of
J.P. Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (formerly known as J.P. Morgan
Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C.):

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
J.P. Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C (the "Fund") at March 31, 2011,
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments at March
31, 2011 by correspondence with the underlying investment funds, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2011

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), formerly the J.P.
Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C., was organized as a limited liability company
on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware and is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment objective
is to generate consistent capital appreciation over the long term, with
relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional equity and
fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective by
allocating its assets primarily among professionally selected investment funds
("Investment Funds") that are managed by experienced third-party investment
advisers ("Portfolio Managers") who invest in a variety of markets and employ,
as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.

J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. ("JPMIM" or the "Investment Manager"), a
corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase"), is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Fund, subject to policies adopted by the Board of
Directors (the "Board"). The Investment Manager has in turn delegated
substantially all investment authority and the allocation of the Fund's assets
among the Investment Funds and other instruments to J.P. Morgan Private
Investments Inc. (the "Sub-Advisor" or "JPMPI"), a corporation formed under the
laws of the State of Delaware and a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase.
The Sub-Advisor will allocate Fund assets among the Investment Funds and other
investments that, in its view, represent attractive investment opportunities.
The Investment Manager also serves as the Managing Member of the Fund (the
"Managing Member").

Both the Investment Manager and the Sub-Advisor are registered as investment
advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers
Act").

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund in preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP").  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires the Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

B. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

The net asset value of the Fund is determined as of the last day of each month
in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board. The
Fund's investments in the Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and can
only be redeemed periodically. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to
which the Fund values its investments in Investment Funds at fair value. In
accordance with these procedures, fair value as of each month-end ordinarily is
the net asset value determined as of such month-end for each Investment Fund in
accordance with the Investment Fund's valuation policies and reported at the
time of the Fund's valuation.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2011 (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Fund uses the Net Asset Value (the "NAV"), to determine the fair value of
all underlying investments which (a) do not have readily determinable fair
values and (b) either have the attributes of an investment company or prepare
their financial statements consistent with measurement principles of an
investment company. As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest
in an Investment Fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonably
expect to receive from an Investment Fund if the Fund's interest were redeemed
at the time of the valuation, based on information reasonably available at the
time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable.
Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates at fair value.  These factors include, but are not limited to, a
review of the underlying securities of the Investment Fund when available,
ongoing due diligence of the style, strategy and valuation methodology employed
by each Investment Fund, and a review of market inputs that may be expected to
impact the performance of a particular Investment Fund. The use of different
factors and estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the
estimated fair value and could be material to the financial statements. In the
unlikely event that an Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the
Fund on a timely basis, the Fund would determine the fair value of such
Investment Fund based on the most recent value reported by the Investment Fund,
as well as any other relevant information available at such time.  Some of the
Investment Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in investments
which may be illiquid. Some of these investments are held in "side pockets", sub
funds within the Investment Funds, which provide for their separate liquidation
potentially over a much longer period than the liquidity an investment in the
Investment Funds may provide. Should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment
in an Investment Fund which maintains investments in a side pocket arrangement
or which holds substantially all of its assets in illiquid securities, the Fund
might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could
be considerable. In such cases, during the period until the Fund is permitted to
fully liquidate its interest in the Investment Funds, the value of its
investment could fluctuate.

The Fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive to sell an
investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with an
independent buyer in the principal market, or in the absence of a principal
market, the most advantageous market for the investment or liability.

Valuations reflected in this report are as of the report date. As a result,
changes in valuation due to market events and/or issuer related events after the
report date and prior to issuance of the report are not reflected herein.

The various inputs that are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
investments are summarized into the three broad levels listed below

     -    Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical

A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
lowest of any input both individually and in aggregate that is significant to
the fair value measurement. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with
investing in those securities.

The following table represents each valuation input, by strategy, as presented

*    The strategy reclassification reflects a change in the classifications of
     investments as determined by the Sub-advisor.

(a) The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at
the beginning of the reporting period. Transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 were
primarily related to the change in liquidity terms of the underlying Investment
Funds during the reporting period. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 were
primarily related to the expiration of lock-up periods imposed by the underlying
Investment Funds and due to liquidity provisions considered by the Fund. There
were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended March 31,
2011.

The Fund had no unfunded capital commitments as of March 31, 2011.

DIVERSIFIED

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy use two or more of the below
strategies. Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 -
65 day redemption notice periods. Approximately 1.8 percent of the fair value of
the investments in Investment Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts.  The remaining approximately 98.2 percent of the Investment
Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can
be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year
ended March 31, 2011, the Fund had two transfers out of Level 3 with a fair
market value of $11,613,248.  Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level
3 purchases and sales for this strategy totaled $124,066 and $1,952,811
respectively.

EVENT DRIVEN - CORE

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in securities of companies
involved in mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, liquidations, spin-offs, or
other special situations that alter a company's financial structure or operating
strategy. Risk management and hedging techniques are typically employed by the
Portfolio Managers to seek to protect the portfolio from deals that fail to
materialize. In addition, accurately forecasting the timing of a transaction is
an important element affecting the realized return. The use of leverage varies.
Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 60 - 93 day
redemption notice periods. Approximately 3.2 percent of the fair value of the
investments in Investment Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 96.8 percent of the Investment
Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can
be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year
ended March 31, 2011, the Fund had one transfer into Level 3 with a fair market
value of $4,492,997. Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level 3 sales
for this strategy $5,703,494.

B. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

EVENT DRIVEN - DISTRESSED

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in debt and equity securities
of companies in financial difficulty, reorganization or bankruptcy,
nonperforming and sub-performing bank loans, and emerging market debt.
Portfolios are usually concentrated in debt instruments. The Portfolio Managers
differ in their preference for actively participating in the workout and
restructuring process and the extent to which they use leverage. Investment
Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 60 - 95 day redemption
notice periods. Approximately 2.5 percent of the fair value of the investments
in Investment Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or liquidating trusts.
The remaining approximately 97.5 percent of the Investment Funds have either
initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with
no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year ended March 31,
2011, the Fund had two transfers out of Level 3 with a fair market value
$11,718,553. Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level 3 purchases and
sales for this strategy totaled $95,043 and $523,657, respectively.

LONG/SHORT EQUITIES

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy make long and short investments in
equity securities that are deemed by the Portfolio Managers to be under or
overvalued.  The Portfolio Managers typically do not attempt to neutralize the
amount of long and short positions (i.e., they will be net long or net short).
The Portfolio Managers may specialize in a particular industry or may allocate
holdings across industries.  Although the strategy is more commonly focused on
U.S. markets, a growing number of Portfolio Managers invest globally. Portfolio
Managers in this strategy usually employ a low to moderate degree of leverage.
Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 - 90 day
redemption notice periods. Approximately 0.3 percent of the fair value of the
investments in Investment Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 99.7 percent of the Investment
Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can
be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year
ended March 31, 2011, the Fund had four transfers in and one transfer out of
Level 3 with fair market values of $1,377,027 and $9,945,404, respectively.
Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level 3 sales for this strategy
totaled $2,326,070.

OPPORTUNISTIC/MACRO

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in a wide variety of
instruments using a broad range of strategies, often assuming an aggressive risk
posture. Most Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy rely on a combination
of macro-economic models and fundamental research to invest across countries,
markets, sectors and companies, and have the flexibility to invest in numerous
financial instruments. Futures and options are often used for hedging and
speculation in order to quickly position a portfolio to profit from changing
markets. The use of leverage varies considerably. Investment Funds within this
strategy are generally subject to 45 - 95 day redemption notice periods.
Approximately 1.2 percent of the fair value of the investments in Investment
Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or liquidating trusts. The remaining
approximately 98.8 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial
redemption dates commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with

no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year ended March 31,
2011, the Fund had two transfers out of Level 3 with a fair market value of
$12,098,941. Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level 3 sales for this
strategy totaled $27,030.

RELATIVE VALUE

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy make simultaneous purchases and sales
of similar securities to exploit pricing differentials or have long exposure in
non-equity oriented beta opportunities (such as credit).  The Portfolio Managers
attempt to neutralize long and short positions to minimize the impact of general
market movements.  Different relative value strategies include convertible bond
arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, yield curve arbitrage and basis
trading. The types of instruments traded vary considerably depending on the
Portfolio Manager's relative value strategy. Because the strategy attempts to
capture relatively small mis-pricings between two related securities, moderate
to substantial leverage is often employed to produce attractive rates of return.
Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 45 - 180 day
redemption notice periods. Approximately 8.7 percent of the fair value of the
investments in Investment Funds in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 91.3 percent of the Investment
Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can
be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date. During the year
ended March 31, 2011, the Fund had seven transfers out of Level 3 with a fair
market value of $18,726,332. Also, during the year ended March 31, 2011, Level 3
purchases and sales for this strategy totaled $1,167,066 and $4,023,656,
respectively.

Any restriction noted above was imposed at various points throughout the year,
at the discretion of the underlying Investment Funds and the time at which the
restriction might lapse cannot be estimated.

C. INVESTMENTS PAID IN ADVANCE

Investments paid in advance represent funds which have been sent to Investment
Funds prior to the Fund's fiscal year-end but are not effective until the first
day of the Fund's next fiscal year.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received, whether in the form of cash or securities, are applied
as a reduction of the investment's cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital. Once the investment's cost is received, any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

E. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from
Investment Fund transactions are calculated on the identified cost basis.
Investments are recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the
Investment Fund.  All changes in the value of the Investment Funds are included
as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.

F. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business other than those that the
Investment Manager assumes. The expenses of the Fund include, but are not
limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment
transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting and
auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

G. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision for the payment of
federal, state or local income taxes has been provided. Each Member is
individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

The Investment Manager evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Fund's financial statements to determine whether the
tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable
tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to
meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. The Investment Manager is not aware of any tax
positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits or expense will significantly change in the next
twelve months. The Investment Manager's conclusions regarding tax positions will
be subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors
including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and
interpretations thereof.

The Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remains subject
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Fund recognizes interest and
penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Fund did
not incur any interest or penalties.

H. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash represents deposits of $8,759,212 held in an interest bearing account at
PNC Bank, N.A. ("PNC") and $2,341,848 held in a money market fund managed by
BlackRock. Amounts, with the exception of the money market fund managed by
Blackrock, in excess of the insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") are subject to counterparty credit risk should PNC be
unable to fulfill its obligations.  The money market fund managed by BlackRock
is considered a Level 1 Security.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Fund has entered into an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement") with the Investment Manager, effective August 25, 2010.

1.25% on an annualized basis) and an additional administrative services fee of
0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis) of end of month Members'
Capital. On August 18, 2010, the Members approved various changes to the
management of the Fund, including authorizing JPMIM to serve as the Investment

its services as Sub-administrator, BNY Mellon receives a portion of the fees
payable to the Administrator.

Prior to August 25, 2010, the Fund had an administration agreement with BNY

Corporation. At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.)
Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

PFPC Trust Company ("PFPC Trust"), which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the
Fund's assets and provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for
services, the Fund pays PFPC Trust a monthly fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average
gross assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $795.

The Investment Manager, or an affiliate of the Investment Manager, has
contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse the Fund to the extent that
total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses,
interest, brokerage commissions, other transaction-related expenses and any
extraordinary expenses as well as any Performance Allocation) exceed 1.92% on an
annualized basis of the Fund's net assets as of the end of each month.

Prior to August 25, 2010, the Prior Investment Manager  had contractually agreed
to waive fees, and if necessary, reimburse expenses in respect of the Fund for
each fiscal year that the agreement was in place so that the total operating
expenses of the Fund (excluding interest, brokerage commissions, other
transaction-related expenses and any extraordinary expenses of the Fund as well
as any Performance Allocation) did not exceed 2.30% on an annualized basis of
the Fund's net assets as of the end of each month.

Certain officers of the Fund are affiliated with the Advisor and the
Administrator.  Such officers, with the exception of the Chief Compliance
Officer, receive no compensation from the Fund for serving in their respective
roles.

Effective August 25, 2010, the Fund adopted a Director Deferred Compensation
Plan (the "Plan") which allows the Independent Directors to defer the receipt of
all or a portion of compensation related to performance of their duties as a
Trustee. The deferred fees are invested in various J.P. Morgan Funds until
distribution in accordance with the Plan.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time, the Fund may borrow cash from a major institution under a
credit agreement up to a maximum of 10 % of the Fund's net assets with a cap of
$30 million. Prior to December 23, 2010, this cap was $8 million. Interest,
which is calculated based on any outstanding balance, and a LIBOR-based rate, is
payable to the lending institution. The Fund also pays a fee on the unused
amount on the line of credit. During the year

4. LINE OF CREDIT (CONTINUED)

ended March 31, 2011, the Fund had 98 days during the period in which it
utilized the credit facility. During those 98 days, the average borrowings
outstanding per day were $10,738,265 at an average annual interest rate of 2.26
%. The Fund had $15 million outstanding on this credit facility as of March 31,
2011. This balance was paid off in April 2011. Interest expense and Credit
facility fees incurred for the year ended March 31, 2011 amounted to $66,047 and
$89,902, respectively, and are included in the Statement of Operations.

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the year ended March 31,
2011 amounted to $375,417,924 and $94,768,043, respectively.

At March 31, 2011, the estimated cost of investments for federal income tax
purposes was substantially the same as the cost for financial reporting
purposes. Accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation on investments was
$34,329,970 and gross unrealized depreciation was $3,659,027, resulting in net
unrealized appreciation of $30,670,943.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally, initial and additional subscription for interests ("Interests") by
eligible investors may be accepted at such times as the Fund may determine. The
Fund reserves the right to reject any subscriptions for Interests in the Fund.
The initial acceptance for subscriptions for Interests was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial Closing Date"). After the Initial Closing Date, the Fund generally
accepts Interests as of the first day of each month. At March 31, 2011 the Fund
received $70,521,131 in subscription proceeds in advance of the April 1, 2011
subscription date. This amount is included in the Statement of Assets,
Liabilities and Members' Capital.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase Interests pursuant to written
tenders by Members.  These repurchases will be made at such times, and in such
amounts, and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole
discretion. The Investment Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September, and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee (the "Repurchase
Fee") payable to the Fund will be charged for repurchases of Members' Interests
at any time prior to the day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a
Member's purchase of its Interests. For the year ended March 31, 2011, the Fund
did not charge any Repurchase Fees to Members.

At the end of each Allocation Period of the Fund, any net capital appreciation
or net capital depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized), as the
case may be, is allocated to the capital accounts of all of the Members
(including the Special Member and the Managing Member) in proportion to their
respective opening capital account balances for such Allocation Period. The
initial "Allocation Period" began on the Initial Closing Date, with each
subsequent Allocation Period beginning immediately after the close of the
preceding Allocation Period.  Each Allocation Period closes on the first to
occur of (1) the last day of each month, (2) the date immediately prior to the
effective date of (a) the admission of a new Member or (b) an increase in a
Member's capital contribution, (3) the effective date of any repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

Allocation Period closes on the first to occur of (1) the last day of each
month, (2) the date immediately prior to the effective date of (a) the admission
of a new Member or (b) an increase in a Member's capital contribution, (3) the
effective date of any repurchase of Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund
dissolves.

At the end of each calendar year, each Member's return on investment for the
year is determined and a portion of the net capital appreciation allocated to
each Member's capital account during the year (the "Performance Allocation"),
net of the Member's allocable share of the Management Fee and the Manager
Administrative Services Fee, equal to 10% of the portion of such net capital
appreciation that exceeds the Preferred Return (as defined below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member.  The "Preferred
Return" is equal to the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield (as defined below) for
each month during the relevant calendar year (or any shorter period of
calculation). The "3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal
one-twelfth of the annual yield for the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill for the first
business day of the then current calendar quarter as set forth in the U.S.
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) under the caption "Treasury
constant maturities", or if such measurement is not available, such other source
as the Managing Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

No Performance Allocation is made, however, with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital depreciation previously allocated to
such Member's capital account plus any Management Fees and Manager
Administrative Service Fees charged to such capital account (the "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately to reflect the repurchase of any portion of that Member's
Interest.  Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member, a Performance Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member, and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis (i.e., the portion of the Interest being
repurchased and the amount with respect to which the Performance Allocation is
calculated) will be deemed to have been taken from the first capital
contribution of such Member (as such contribution has been adjusted for net
capital appreciation or depreciation, Management Fees, Manager Administrative
Services Fees and other expenses) until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent capital contribution until such contribution (as adjusted) is
decreased to zero.

For financial reporting purposes, the Performance Allocation is calculated and
reallocated to the Special Member on an accrual basis as if the Performance
Allocation had occurred as of the end of the fiscal year. The Performance
Allocation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 were
$158,575 and $1,357,688, respectively. These amounts are reported as Performance
Allocation on the Statement of Changes in Members' Capital.

The Performance Allocation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 is comprised
of $117,765 which was allocated as of December 31, 2009, $40,190 which was
accrued for the period January 31, 2010 to March 31, 2010 and reallocated as of
December 31, 2010 and $620 which was reallocated as of March 31, 2010, resulting
from tendering Interests for repurchase on that date.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

The Performance Allocation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 is
comprised of $578,382 which was allocated as of December 31, 2010, $774,034
which was accrued for the period January 31, 2011 to March 31, 2011 and
$2,968 and $2,304 which were reallocated as of September 30, 2010 and March
31, 2011, respectively, resulting from tendering Interests for repurchase
on these date. The amount accrued from January 1, 2011 through March 31,
2011 is subject to change as Performance Allocation is subject to change as
Performance Allocations occur at the end of the calendar year.

7. RISK EXPOSURE

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to,
short-selling activities, writing option contracts, contracts for differences,
and interest rate, credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the value of the
Fund's investments in the Investment Funds.

In pursuing its investment objectives, the Fund invests in Investment Funds that
are not registered under the 1940 Act. These Investment Funds may utilize
diverse investment strategies, which are not generally managed against
traditional investment indices.  The Investment Funds selected by the Fund will
invest in and actively  trade securities and other financial instruments using a
variety of strategies and investment techniques that may involve significant
risks. Such risks arise from the volatility of the equity, fixed income,
commodity and currency markets,  leverage both on and off balance sheet
associated  with  borrowings,   short  sales  and  derivative instruments,  the
potential illiquidity of certain instruments including emerging markets, private
transactions, derivatives, and counterparty and broker defaults. Various risks
are also associated with an investment in the Fund, including risks relating to
the multi-manager structure of the Fund, risks relating to compensation
arrangements and risks related to limited liquidity of the Interests. The
Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to
annually, and may be subject to various lock-up provisions and early withdrawal
fees.

The investments of the Investment Funds are subject to normal market
fluctuations and other risks inherent in investing in securities and there can
be no assurance that any appreciation in value will occur. The value of
investments can fall as well as rise and investors may not realize the amount
that they invest.

Although the Investment Manager will seek to select Investment Funds that offer
the opportunity to have their shares or units  redeemed  within a  reasonable
timeframe,  there can be no assurance  that the liquidity of the investments of
such Investment Funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests as,
and when, made.

The Investment Manager may invest the Fund's assets in Investment Funds that
invest in illiquid securities and do not permit frequent withdrawals. Illiquid
securities owned by Investment Funds are riskier than liquid securities because
the Investment Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if
their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the
illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price.  Similarly, the illiquidity
of the Investment Funds may cause Members to incur losses because of an
inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund during or following
periods of negative performance.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2011 (continued)

7. RISK EXPOSURE (CONTINUED)

The Investment Funds may invest in the securities of foreign companies that
involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing
in U.S. companies. These risks include devaluation of currencies, less reliable
information about issuers, different securities transaction clearance and
settlement practices, and future adverse political and economic developments.
Moreover, securities of many foreign companies and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those securities of comparable U.S.
companies.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations that provide general indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9. CONCENTRATIONS

One or more affiliates of the Fund's Investment Manager have investment
discretion with respect to their client's holdings in the Fund, which
collectively represent a significant portion of the Fund's assets. Significant
Member transactions, if any, may impact the Fund's performance.

                      J.P. MORGAN PRIVATE INVESTMENTS INC.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Advisers are fiduciaries and must act in the best interest of the client with
respect to functions undertaken on behalf of the client, including proxy voting
activities. An adviser must adopt and implement written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest of the
client, conflicts are identified and handled appropriately; and fiduciary
obligations are fulfilled. An adviser must disclose to its clients how they may
obtain information on how proxies were voted for securities held for their
accounts. An adviser must disclose to clients information about its proxy voting
policies and procedures and how clients may obtain the policies and procedures.

THIS SECTION IS APPLICABLE TO JPMPI IN ITS CAPACITY TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE
AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS TO THE PRIVATE FUNDS.

          1.   Generally

On occasion, an issuer of an investment held by a Private Fund will request that
an action be taken by such issuer's investors (e.g., the Private Fund). The
terms of the partnership or limited liability company agreement of the Private
Fund will set forth the policies and procedures for casting the Private Fund's
vote on the action. In cases where the Private Fund's investors have the right
to vote on the matter, depending on the agreement, JPMPI, on behalf of the
Private Fund, will either (i) cast votes representing a percentage of the
Private Fund's interest in the issuer based on the percentage of votes JPMPI
received

<PAGE>

from the Private Fund's investors or (ii) cast votes for the Private Fund's
entire interest in the issuer based on the votes JPMPI received from the Private
Fund's investors. In cases where JPMPI has the sole proxy authority to vote on a
matter (and investors do not have voting rights), JPMPI has adopted the
following voting policies and procedures:

          2.   Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

In general, JPMPI will handle all proxies and other corporate actions in a
timely manner as part of its authority. JPMPI's President is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that all proxies received by JPMPI, on behalf of
Private Funds, are voted in a timely manner and in a manner consistent with the
Private Fund's best interests. JPMPI's fiduciary obligation to manage accounts
in the best interests of the Private Funds extends to proxy voting. When voting
proxies or acting with respect to corporate actions for Private Funds, JPMPI
will act in a prudent and diligent manner solely with the goal of maximizing the
economic value of the assets of the Private Fund's account and thereby providing
the greatest possible return to investors' investments consistent with governing
laws and the investment policies of the Private Fund.

As the management of a company is responsible for its day to day operations,
JPMPI believes that management, subject to the oversight of its board of
directors, is often in the best position to make decisions that serve the
interest of investors. However, JPMPI generally votes against management on
proposals where it perceives a conflict may exist between management and client
interests, such as those that may insulate management or diminish investor
rights. JPMPI also generally votes against management in other cases where the
facts and circumstances indicate that the proposal is not in its client's best
interests.

<PAGE>

THIS SECTION IS APPLICABLE TO JPMPI IN ITS CAPACITY AS A SUB-ADVISOR TO THE
RICS.

     -    JPMPI seeks to have each investment management agreement set forth
          whether JPMPI or the client are responsible for voting proxies. If
          JPMPI is responsible, it is JPMPI's obligation to vote proxies in the
          best interests of the client.

     -    Investment personnel are principally responsible for determining how
          to vote individual proxies in accordance with the JPMorgan Asset
          Management Proxy Voting Procedures and Guidelines.

     -    It is the policy of JPMPI to vote all proxies received on stock held
          in portfolios over which JPMPI has discretionary management and proxy
          voting authority, unless JPMPI determines that it is not in the best
          interests of the client to vote any particular proxy.

     -    To assist JPMPI's investment personnel with proxy voting proposals,
          JPMAM may retain the services of an independent proxy voting services
          The services may assist with such items as: coordinating with client
          custodians to ensure that all proxy materials are processed in a
          timely fashion; voting all proposals that are clearly covered in the
          JPMorgan Asset Management Proxy Voting Procedures and Guidelines;
          providing JPMPI with a comprehensive analysis of each proxy proposal;
          and providing JPMPI with recommendations on how to vote each proxy
          proposal based on JPMorgan Asset Management Proxy Voting Procedures
          and Guidelines.

     -    To oversee the proxy voting process on an on-going basis, JPMAM has
          established a Proxy Committee has been established that meets at least
          semi-annually. The Committee is composed of the Proxy Administrator
          and senior officers from among the Investment, Legal, Compliance,
          Operations and Risk Management Departments.

     -    The primary functions of the Proxy Committee are to periodically
          review general proxy voting matters; to review and approve the
          JPMorgan Asset Management Proxy Voting Procedures and Guidelines
          annually; and to provide advice and recommendations on general proxy
          voting matters as well as on specific voting issues to be implemented.

     -    JPMAM has established the role of a Proxy Administrator to oversee
          the proxy voting process. The Proxy Administrator monitors
          recommendations from outside proxy services, escalates issues to
          appropriate investment professionals and confirms the outside
          services' recommendation with the appropriate investment professional.
          The Proxy Administrator utilizes an automated system to communicate,
          track and store the relevant data regarding the proxy voting process.

     -    Investment personnel, which may include Corporate Governance
          Specialists*, analyze issues to determine if any direct or indirect
          conflict regarding proxy voting exists, and if any conflict is
          identified the matter is referred to the Proxy Administrator.

     -    In situations in which the JPMorgan Asset Management Proxy Voting
          Procedures and Guidelines are silent or recommend a case by case
          analysis, the Proxy Administrator will forward the proxy voting
          services' voting recommendations to the appropriate investment
          professional. The investment professional will determine if the
          recommendations provided should be accepted.

     -    If a material conflict of interest is identified by the Proxy
          Administrator, investment professional or Corporate Governance
          Specialist for the particular proxy vote, it is the responsibility of
          the Proxy Administrator to convene a subset of the Proxy Committee to
          review and determine what action should be taken, including the
          possibility of retaining an independent third party to exercise
          fiduciary responsibility in voting.

     -    An investment professional may override the recommendation of the
          proxy service and/or the normal JPMPI policy position, if special
          circumstances apply. If so, certification by the
<PAGE>
          investment professional is required and must include: a written
          analysis supporting their recommendation, confirmation that the
          Safeguard Policy and Information Barriers Policies were not violated
          and a statement that there is not a conflict of interest.

     -    The Proxy Administrator's duties include reviewing overrides and
          determining if they should be referred to the Proxy Committee for
          review.

     -    The Compliance Department verifies that JPMPI's ADV contains
          appropriate disclosure on how to obtain the JPMorgan Asset Management
          Proxy Voting Policy and Guidelines and voting records.

     -    JPMPI's clients can obtain voting records for their portfolio(s).

     -    Following a request from a client to their Client Service Manager,
          JPMPI's clients can obtain voting records for their portfolio(s) as
          well as a copy of the JPMorgan Asset Management Proxy Voting Policy
          and Guidelines.

---------------
*    Please note: For international markets, where market practices
     vary widely and where independent proxy voting services are less-well
     developed, all voting decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by
     Corporate Governance Specialists in conjunction with investment
     professionals, based exclusively on the principles contained in the JPMPI's
     Proxy Voting Guidelines, as opposed to the recommendations of third-party
     agencies based on their interpretation of JPMPI's Proxy Voting Guidelines.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser provide investment management services to
other clients, including other multi-manager funds and discretionary managed
accounts, that follow investment programs substantially similar to that of the
Fund. As a result, when a limited investment opportunity would be appropriate
for the Fund and also for one or more of its other clients, the Investment
Manager and Sub-Adviser will be required to choose among the Fund and such other
clients in allocating such opportunity, or to allocate less of such opportunity
to the Fund than the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser would ideally allocate if
it did not provide investment management services to other clients. In addition,
the Investment Manager and/or Sub-Adviser may determine that an investment
opportunity is appropriate for a particular client, or for itself or an
affiliate, but not for the Fund. Situations may arise in which other client
accounts managed by the Investment Manager and/or Sub-Adviser or its affiliates
have made investments that would have been suitable for investment by the Fund
but, for various reasons, were not pursued by, or available to, the Fund. The
Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser attempt to allocate limited investment
opportunities among the Fund and their other client accounts in a manner they
believe to be reasonable and equitable.

<PAGE>

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION

The Adviser's portfolio managers participate in a competitive compensation
program that is designed to attract and retain outstanding people and closely
link the performance of investment professionals to client investment
objectives. The total compensation program includes a base salary fixed from
year to year and a variable performance bonus consisting of cash incentives and
restricted stock and may include mandatory notional investments (as described
below) in selected mutual funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates. These
elements reflect individual performance and the performance of the Adviser's
business as a whole.

Each portfolio manager's performance is formally evaluated annually based on a
variety of factors including the aggregate size and blended performance of the
portfolios such portfolio manager manages. Individual contribution relative to
client goals carries the highest impact. Portfolio manager compensation is
primarily driven by meeting or exceeding clients' risk and return objectives,
relative performance to competitors or competitive indices and compliance with
firm policies and regulatory requirements. In evaluating each portfolio
manager's performance with respect to the mutual funds he or she manages, the
Funds' pre-tax performance is compared to the appropriate market peer group and
to each Fund's benchmark index listed in the Fund's prospectuses over one, three
and five year periods (or such shorter time as the portfolio manager has managed
the Fund). Investment performance is generally more heavily weighted to the
long-term.

Awards of restricted stock are granted as part of an employee's annual
performance bonus and comprise from 0% to 40% of a portfolio manager's total
bonus. As the level of incentive compensation increases, the percentage of
compensation awarded in restricted stock also increases. Up to 50% of the
restricted stock portion of a portfolio manager's bonus may instead be subject
to mandatory notional investment in selected mutual funds advised by the Adviser
or its affiliates. When these awards vest over time, the portfolio manager
receives cash equal to the market value of the notional investment in the
selected mutual funds.

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE

     PERSONS COVERED BY THIS CODE OF ETHICS:
     PATRICIA A. MALESKI     PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER
     JOY C. DOWD             PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER

     1.   COVERED OFFICERS/ PURPOSE OF THE CODE

          a.   THIS SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE JPMORGAN FUNDS (THE
               "FUNDS") APPLIES TO THE FUND'S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND
               PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER (THE "COVERED OFFICERS") FOR THE
               PURPOSE OF PROMOTING

                    i.   HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE ETHICAL
                         HANDLING OF ACTUAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
                         BETWEEN PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS;

                    ii.  FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE
                         DISCLOSURE IN REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT A REGISTRANT
                         FILES WITH, OR SUBMITS TO, THE SEC AND IN OTHER PUBLIC
                         COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY THE FUNDS;

                    iii. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL RULES
                         AND REGULATIONS;

                    iv.  THE PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS OF THIS
                         SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS TO AN APPROPRIATE PERSON
                         OR PERSONS IDENTIFIED HEREIN; AND

                    v.   ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THIS SARBANES-OXLEY
                         CODE OF ETHICS.

          b.   EACH COVERED OFFICER SHOULD ADHERE TO A HIGH STANDARD OF
               BUSINESS ETHICS AND SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO SITUATIONS THAT MAY
               GIVE RISE TO ACTUAL AS WELL AS APPARENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

     2.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT
          CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

A "CONFLICT OF INTEREST" OCCURS WHEN A COVERED OFFICER'S PRIVATE INTEREST
INTERFERES WITH THE INTERESTS OF, OR HIS SERVICE TO, THE FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE, A
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WOULD ARISE IF A COVERED OFFICER, OR A MEMBER OF HIS
FAMILY, RECEIVES IMPROPER PERSONAL BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF HIS POSITION WITH THE
FUNDS.

CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISE OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COVERED
OFFICERS AND THE FUNDS AND ALREADY ARE SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
PROVISIONS IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND THE ADVISERS ACT. FOR EXAMPLE,
COVERED OFFICERS MAY NOT INDIVIDUALLY ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS
THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SECURITIES OR OTHER PROPERTY) WITH THE FUNDS BECAUSE OF
THEIR STATUS AS "AFFILIATED PERSONS" OF THE FUNDS. THE FUNDS AND THE INVESTMENT
ADVISER'S COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND PROCEDURES ARE DESIGNED TO PREVENT, OR
IDENTIFY AND CORRECT, VIOLATIONS OF THESE PROVISIONS. THIS SARBANES-OXLEY CODE
OF ETHICS DOES NOT, AND IS NOT INTENDED TO, REPEAT OR REPLACE THESE PROGRAMS AND
PROCEDURES.
<PAGE>
ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY NOT PRESENTING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROPER PERSONAL BENEFIT,
CONFLICTS MAY ARISE FROM, OR AS A RESULT OF, THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE FUNDS AND THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS, PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITERS,
ADMINISTRATORS, AND/OR AFFILIATED PERSONS THEREOF (THE "FUNDS PRINCIPAL SERVICE
PROVIDERS") OF WHICH THE COVERED OFFICERS ARE ALSO OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. AS A
RESULT, THE SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS RECOGNIZES THAT THE COVERED OFFICERS
WILL, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THEIR DUTIES (WHETHER FORMALLY FOR THE COMPANY,
THE FUNDS PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR FOR BOTH) BE INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING
POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING DECISIONS THAT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THE
FUNDS PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE FUNDS.  THE PARTICIPATION OF THE
COVERED OFFICERS IN SUCH ACTIVITIES IS INHERENT IN THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE FUNDS AND THE FUNDS PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE PERFORMANCE BY THE COVERED OFFICERS OF THEIR DUTIES AS OFFICERS OF THE
FUNDS.  THUS, IF PERFORMED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE INVESTMENT

THAT THE COVERED OFFICERS MAY ALSO BE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES OF ONE OR MORE OTHER
INVESTMENT COMPANIES COVERED BY THIS OR OTHER CODES.

OTHER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE COVERED BY THE SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS,
EVEN IF SUCH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS IN THE
INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND THE ADVISERS ACT. THE FOLLOWING LIST PROVIDES
EXAMPLES OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY CODE OF ETHICS, BUT
COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE EXAMPLES ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. THE
OVERARCHING PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF A COVERED OFFICER SHOULD
NOT BE PLACED IMPROPERLY BEFORE THE INTEREST OF THE FUNDS.

                    WOULD BENEFIT PERSONALLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE FUNDS;

               b.   NOT CAUSE THE FUNDS TO TAKE ACTION, OR FAIL TO TAKE ACTION,
                    FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THE COVERED OFFICER
                    RATHER THAN THE BENEFIT THE FUNDS;

               c.   COMPLETE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THE FUNDS' TRUSTEE AND OFFICER
                    QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH REQUESTS INFORMATION REGARDING OTHER

     4.   IN FURTHERANCE OF THE ABOVE, BELOW ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF CONFLICT OF
          INTEREST: SITUATIONS THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH THE INVESTMENT
          ADVISER'S COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
          DAY-TO-DAY MONITORING OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND/OR THE FUNDS CHIEF
          COMPLIANCE OFFICER. EXAMPLES OF THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

               a.   SERVING AS A DIRECTOR ON THE BOARD OF ANY PUBLIC, PRIVATE

               c.   THE RECEIPT OF ANY ENTERTAINMENT FROM ANY COMPANY WITH
                    WHICH THE FUNDS HAVE CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS
                    DEALINGS UNLESS SUCH ENTERTAINMENT IS BUSINESS RELATED,
                    REASONABLE IN COST, APPROPRIATE AS TO TIME AND PLACE, AND
                    NOT SO FREQUENT AS TO RAISE ANY QUESTION OF IMPROPRIETY OR
                    OTHER FORMULATION AS THE FUNDS ALREADY USE IN ANOTHER CODE
                    OF CONDUCT;

               d.   ANY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, OR ANY CONSULTING OR EMPLOYMENT
                    RELATIONSHIP WITH, ANY OF THE FUNDS' SERVICE PROVIDERS,
                    OTHER THAN THE FUNDS PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.;

               e.   A DIRECT OR INDIRECT FINANCIAL INTEREST IN COMMISSIONS,

                    SHARES SUCH AS COMPENSATION OR EQUITY OWNERSHIP OTHER THAN
                    AN INTEREST ARISING FROM THE COVERED OFFICER'S EMPLOYMENT
                    WITH THE FUNDS' PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.

     5.   DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

                    DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO THE FUND;

               b.   EACH COVERED OFFICER SHOULD NOT KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT, OR

                    REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS;

               c.   IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH COVERED OFFICER TO PROMOTE
                    COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS AND RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY
                    APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS;
