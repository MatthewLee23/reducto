             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE MEMBERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
       UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2009, and the related  statements of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended,  the  statements  of changes in members'
capital for each of the two years in the period then  ended,  and the  financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.  These financial
statements  and  financial  highlights  are  the  responsibility  of the  Fund's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments in investment funds as of December 31, 2009, by correspondence  with
management  of the  underlying  investment  funds.  We  believe  that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2
Fund,  L.L.C.  at December 31, 2009,  the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members'  capital for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles.

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the  "Fund") was  organized  as a limited  liability
     company  under  the laws of  Delaware  on  August  13,  2001 and  commenced
     operations on February 1, 2003. The Fund is registered under the Investment
     Company  Act of  1940,  as  amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,
     non-diversified,  management  investment  company.  The  Fund's  investment
     objective is to seek capital appreciation over the long-term. The Fund is a
     multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its  objective by  deploying  its
     assets  among a select group of portfolio  managers  who  primarily  employ
     long/short  equity  strategies,  including those involving foreign issuers.
     Generally,  such  portfolio  managers  conduct  their  investment  programs
     through  unregistered  investment  funds  (collectively,   the  "Investment
     Funds"),  in  which  the Fund  invests  as a  limited  partner,  member  or
     shareholder along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser"  and, when
     providing    services    under   the    Administration    Agreement,    the
     "Administrator"),   a  Delaware  limited  liability  company,   to  provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the  Directors may determine and are generally
     accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application
     for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  Members  can only  transfer  or  assign  their
     membership  interests or a portion thereof (i) by operation of law pursuant
     to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or dissolution of a Member,  or (ii)
     with the written approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in their
     sole  and  absolute  discretion.  Such  transfers  may be made  even if the
     balance of the capital  account to such transferee is equal to or less than
     the transferor's initial capital contribution.


                                                                               7

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2009

2.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     On June 30,  2009,  the Fund adopted new  accounting  guidance to determine
     whether  there has been a  significant  decrease in the volume and level of
     activity  for an  asset or  liability  when  compared  with  normal  market
     activity for such asset or liability  (or similar  assets and  liabilities)
     and identifying  circumstances  that indicate a transaction with regards to
     such an asset or liability is not  orderly.  The guidance  also expands the
     disclosures  of  fair  value  measurements  in  the  financial  statements.
     Adoption  of this  guidance  did not have a  material  impact on the Fund's
     members' capital or results of operations.

     In June 2009, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued THE
     FASB  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  CODIFICATION  AND THE  HIERARCHY  OF GENERALLY
     ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES  ("Codification").  The standard identifies
     the Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S.  accounting and
     reporting standards applicable for all non-governmental  entities, with the
     exception of guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange  Commission and
     its  staff.  The  Codification  did not  change  U. S.  generally  accepted
     accounting principles ("GAAP"),  but rather organized them into a hierarchy
     where all  guidance  within  the  Codification  carries  an equal  level of
     authority.  It is effective for financial statements issued for interim and
     fiscal years ending on or after  September 15, 2009. The  Codification  did
     not have a material effect on the Fund's financial statements.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund  values its  investments  using fair value which is the price that
     would be received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability  in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various  inputs  are  used in  determining  the fair  value  of the  Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within ninety days
     of the measurement date
     LEVEL 3-- fair value of  investments  in Investment  Funds that do not have
     the  ability  to  redeem  at net  asset  value  within  ninety  days of the
     measurement date

     GAAP provides guidance in determining  whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared  with  normal  market  activity  for such asset or  liability  (or
     similar assets or liabilities).  GAAP also provides guidance on identifying
     circumstances  that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     its consideration,  the Fund must consider inputs and valuation  techniques
     used for each major category for  securities  with "major  category"  being
     defined as major security type. For assets and liabilities measured at fair
     value on a  recurring  basis  during  the  period,  the Fund  must  provide
     quantitative  disclosures about the fair value measurements  separately for
     each major category of assets and liabilities,  as well as a reconciliation
     of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and  liabilities  broken
     down by major category.

     The following is a summary of the investment  strategy and any restrictions
     on the liquidity  provisions of the investments in Investment Funds held in
     the  Fund as of  December  31,  2009.  Investment  Funds  with  no  current
     redemption  restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions
     or other  restrictions,  in accordance with their offering  documents.  The
     Fund had no unfunded capital commitments as of December 31, 2009.

     The Investment Funds in the long/short  equity strategy invest in both long
     and short equity  strategies  that are primarily in US common  stocks.  The
     management of these Investment  Funds has the ability to shift  investments
     from value to growth strategies,  from small to large capitalization common
     stocks,  and from a net long position to a net short  position.  Investment
     Funds  within  this  strategy  are  generally  subject  to a 15 -  125  day
     redemption  notice period.  Investment Funds  representing  approximately 3
     percent of fair  value are side  pockets or  liquidating  trusts  where the
     liquidation  of assets are expected over the next 24 months.  The remaining
     approximately  97  percent of the  Investment  Funds  have  either  initial
     redemption  dates  commencing  in the  future (10  percent)  or they can be
     redeemed with no restrictions  (87 percent) as of the  measurement  date of
     December 31, 2009.

     The Investment Fund in the multi-strategy strategy invests in both long and
     short, equity and debt strategies that are primarily in United States based
     securities.   The   management   of   this   partnership   seek   arbitrage
     opportunities,  distressed  securities,  corporate  restructures and hedges
     established in equities, convertible securities, options, warrants, rights,
     forward contracts,  futures,  trade claims,  credit default swaps and other
     derivatives,  real estate and other financial  instruments.  The Investment
     Fund is  generally  subject to a 45 day  redemption  notice  period and has
     imposed a gate which has been in effect for 6 months and is  expected to be
     lifted within 12 months.

     A detailed  depiction of each  investment  in the  portfolio by  investment
     strategy,  including any additional liquidity terms and other restrictions,
     as well as a breakdown  of the  portfolio  into the fair value  measurement
     levels,  can be  found in the  tables  within  the  Schedule  of  Portfolio
     Investments.

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Adviser  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or


                                                                               9

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies  established by
     the Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to
     the  terms  and  conditions  of the  respective  operating  agreements  and
     offering memorandums, as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment
     Funds  are  carried  at  fair  value.  All  valuations   utilize  financial
     information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and
     performance  incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds'
     managers  or  pursuant  to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's
     valuation   procedures   require  the  Adviser  to  consider  all  relevant
     information  available  at the time  the Fund  values  its  portfolio.  The
     Adviser has assessed factors  including,  but not limited to the individual
     Investment   Funds'   compliance  with  fair  value   measurements,   price
     transparency and valuation procedures in place, subscription and redemption
     activity,  level of illiquid  securities held, and the existence or absence
     of certain redemption  restrictions.  The Adviser and/or the Directors will
     consider such information and consider whether it is appropriate,  in light
     of all  relevant  circumstances,  to value such a position at its net asset
     value  as  reported  or  whether  to  adjust  such  value.  The  underlying
     investments  of each  Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as
     described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.  (See Schedule of
     Portfolio Investments).

     The  fair  value  relating  to  certain  underlying  investments  of  these
     Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has been estimated by
     the  respective  Investment  Funds'  management and is based upon available
     information  in the absence of readily  ascertainable  fair values and does
     not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to
     the inherent  uncertainty  of valuation,  those  estimated  fair values may
     differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
     market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

     The fair  value of the  Fund's  assets  and  liabilities  which  qualify as
     financial  instruments  approximates the carrying amounts  presented in the
     Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund  accounts  for  realized  gains and losses  from  Investment  Fund
     transactions  based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying  investment  at the  date of  redemption.  Interest  income  and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C.   FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of


                                                                              10

     C.   FUND EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     insurance;   registration   expenses;   interest   expense;   offering  and
     organization  costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;
     expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has reclassified  $12,930,550 and $16,127,317 from accumulated net
     investment  loss  and  accumulated  net  realized  gain  from  investments,
     respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year ended December
     31, 2009.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     contributions,  the amount of  estimated  taxable  income or loss that have
     been  allocated  to the Fund's  Members as of December  31, 2009 and had no
     effect on members' capital.

     Management  has analyzed the Fund's tax positions  taken on federal  income
     tax returns for all open tax years (current and prior three tax years), and
     has concluded  that no provision for federal  income tax is required in the
     Fund's  financial  statements.  The  Fund's  federal  and state  income tax
     returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have
     not expired are subject to examination by the Internal  Revenue Service and
     state departments of revenue.

     Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the Statement
     of Assets,  Liabilities  and Members'  Capital.  Such cash,  at times,  may
     exceed federally insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses in
     such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant  credit
     risk on such accounts.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with GAAP requires
     management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported
     amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and
     liabilities  at the  date of the  financial  statements  and  the  reported
     amounts of  increases  and  decreases in members'  capital from  operations
     during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from those
     estimates.


                                                                              11

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides  investment  advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     an Investment  Management Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement,  the Fund
     pays the Adviser a monthly  fee (the  "Investment  Management  Fee") at the
     annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's members' capital,  excluding the capital
     account attributable to the Adviser and the Administrator.

     The  Administrator  provides certain  administrative  services to the Fund,
     including,  among other  things,  providing  office space and other support
     services.   In  consideration   for  such  services,   the  Fund  pays  the
     Administrator  a monthly  fee (the  "Management  Fee") at an annual rate of
     0.30%  of the  Fund's  members'  capital,  excluding  the  capital  account
     attributable to the Administrator  and the Adviser.  The Management Fee and
     the Investment Management Fee will be paid to the Administrator and Adviser
     out of the Fund's assets and debited against the Members' capital accounts,
     excluding the capital  account  attributable to the  Administrator  and the
     Adviser. A portion of the Investment  Management Fee and the Management Fee
     is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs  associated  with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members'  capital  derived from  operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all Members on
     a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than  the  Investment  Management  Fee  and the
     Management Fee which are similarly  allocated to all Members other than the
     Adviser or Administrator as described above.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
     for each meeting  attended.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the
     Chairman of the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors  each receive an
     additional   annual  retainer  in  the  amounts  of  $10,000  and  $15,000,
     respectively.  These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the
     Fund on a  pro-rata  basis  with ten  other UBS  funds  where  UBSFA is the
     investment  adviser.  All  Directors  are  reimbursed  by the  Fund for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

     respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2009.

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management

     arrangement. Detailed information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is
     not available.

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
     these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.


                                                                              13

8.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience,  the Fund feels that the likelihood of
     such an event is remote.

9.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     As of December 31, 2009, the Fund had  $92,739,896 of withdrawals  payable.
     On January  21,  2010,  the Fund paid  $73,289,962.  The  remaining  amount
     payable of $19,449,934 is scheduled to be paid in accordance with the terms
     of the Fund's June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009 tender offers.

     Management  has evaluated the impact of all  subsequent  events on the Fund
     through  February 23, 2010, the date the financial  statements were issued,
     and  has  determined  that  there  were  no  additional  subsequent  events
     requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

The following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund's investments at fair value. The inputs or methodology used
for valuing the Fund's  investments  are not  necessarily  an  indication  of the risk  associated  with  investing  in those
investments. The Fund's valuation procedures require evaluation of all relevant factors available at the time the Fund values
its portfolio. These relevant factors include the individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair value measurements, price
transparency and valuation procedures in place,  subscription and redemption activity, level of illiquid securities held, and
the existence or absence of redemption restrictions.

The Fund's  investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed below. Level 1 discloses the amount of investments where
the values of those  investments are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical  securities.  Level 2 discloses
the amount of investments where the Fund has the ability to redeem at net asset value as of the December 31, 2009 measurement
date, or within ninety days of the measurement date. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund does not have
the ability to redeem at net asset value within ninety days of the December 31, 2009 measurement date.

                         UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

     The Directors  (including  the  Independent  Directors)  last evaluated the
Investment Management Agreement at a meeting on November 19, 2009. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Management  Agreement.  The Directors reviewed materials furnished by
UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C. (the "Adviser"),  including  information regarding the
Adviser,  its affiliates and its personnel,  operations and financial condition.
Tables  indicating  comparative fee  information,  and  comparative  performance
information,  as well as a summary  financial  analysis for the Fund,  were also
included in the meeting materials and were reviewed and discussed. The Directors
discussed  with  representatives  of the Adviser the Fund's  operations  and the
Adviser's ability to provide advisory and other services to the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed,  among other  things,  the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the  Adviser,  including  its  investment
process,  and the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel
proposing to provide  services to the Fund. The Directors  discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's
stated  investment  objectives  and  policies,  as  well as the  services  to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance
services,  oversight  of Fund  accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in
meeting legal and regulatory  requirements and other services  necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of
highly skilled investment  professionals,  research analysts and administrative,
legal and  compliance  staff  members to ensure  that a high level of quality in
compliance  and  administrative  services  would be  provided  to the Fund.  The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial").  Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and
that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed  the  performance  of the Fund and  compared  that
performance to the performance of other  investment  companies  presented by UBS
Financial  which had objectives and strategies  similar to those of the Fund and
which  are  managed  by  other,  third-party  investment  advisers  ("Comparable
Funds").  The Directors  recognized that the Comparable Funds, as private funds,
are not subject to certain investment  restrictions under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, that are applicable to the Fund and which can adversely
affect the Fund's  performance  relative to that of its  Comparable  Funds.  The
Directors  observed  that the Fund's 2009 return for the period ended  September
30, 2009  exceeded  the median  returns of the  Comparable  Funds,  and that the
Fund's performance for the three- and five-year periods ended September 30, 2009
exceeded  the median  annualized  return of the  Comparable  Funds and  relevant
indexes  (HFRI  Equity  Hedge,  HFRX Equity  Hedge,  MSCI World Index  (MSDUWI),
Russell 2000 Index,  Russell 2000 Growth Index, Russell 2000 Value Index and S&P
500 DRI).  The Directors also compared the volatility of the Fund to that of its
Comparable  Funds. The Directors noted that for the three- and five-year periods
ended September 30, 2009, the Fund's  volatility was below the median volatility
of the  relevant  indexes,  and above the median  volatility  of its  Comparable
Funds.

<PAGE>

     The Directors considered the advisory fees being charged by the Adviser for
its services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the  Comparable  Funds,
and as compared to the advisory  fees charged by the Adviser and its  affiliates
for other UBS alternative  investment products. The information presented to the
Directors  showed that the Fund's  management fee was higher than all but one of
its Comparable  Funds'  management  fees, but that the Fund is not subject to an
incentive  fee. In comparing  the advisory fees being charged to the Fund to the
fees being charged by the Adviser and its affiliates  for other UBS  alternative
investment  products,  the  Directors  noted that  although the  combination  of
management  fee and service fee being  charged to the Fund was the highest being
charged to a UBS  alternative  investment  multi-manager  fund, the Fund was not
subject to any incentive fee. In light of the foregoing, the Directors felt that
the management fee being charged to the Fund was  appropriate and was within the
overall range of the fees paid by the  Comparable  Funds and other  relevant UBS
alternative Investment Products.

     The Directors also considered the  profitability of the Adviser both before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits
to be realized by the Adviser  and its  affiliates  under the Fund's  Investment
Management  Agreement  and from other  relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA
were within a range the Directors  considered  reasonable and  appropriate.  The
Directors  also  discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large  enough at that
time to  support  a request  for  breakpoints  due to  economies  of scale.  The
Directors  determined that the fees under the Investment  Advisory Agreement did
not constitute fees that are so disproportionally large as to bear no reasonable
relationship  to the services  rendered and that could not have been the product
of arm's length  bargaining,  and concluded that the fees were  reasonable.  The
Directors concluded that approval of the Investment  Management Agreement was in
the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each
a "Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as
such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do
not submit matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted
for vote and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund,
the Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund and in accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of
Directors (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

<PAGE>

     -    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
          Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
          an impending proxy vote;

     -    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
          personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
          outcome of a shareholder vote;

     -    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
          manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
          management, have a personal interest through investment in the
          Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     -    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in
          the outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either
          the Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

          If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

          If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the
Adviser's Chief Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel
of the Adviser to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such
conflict of interest. Resolutions may include:

     -    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
          consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
          board of directors);

     -    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
          its behalf;

     -    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
          based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     -    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
          given the nature of the conflict.

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

<PAGE>

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

     -    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     -    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     -    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
          related materials with regard to each vote;

     -    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution
          of conflicts of interest;

     -    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
          proxy -voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
          decision; and

A copy of each written investor request for information on how the Adviser voted
proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written response from the
Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for information on how the
Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                               UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder, Joseph
M. Sciortino and

<PAGE>

Matthew Woodbury, the other members of the portfolio management team, are
jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception,
and as head of the Adviser's portfolio management group since 1998. He is also
currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2007. Mr. Sinder has been associated with
the Adviser since 1998 and is also an Executive Director of UBS Financial
Services. Mr. Sciortino joined the portfolio management team in 2007. Mr.
Sciortino has been associated with the Adviser since 2006 and is also a Director
of UBS Financial Services. Previously, he served as Senior Analyst at Lake
Partners, Inc. from April 2001 though August 2006. Mr. Woodbury has been
associated with the Adviser since 2008 and has served as Portfolio Manager
during this time. Mr. Woodbury is a Director of UBS Financial Services.
Previously, he served as an Analyst at Allianz Hedge Fund Partners, LP
(2002-2008) and an Accountant at Arthur Anderson LLP (1999-2002).

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment

<PAGE>

and business personnel at UBS Financial Services periodically review the
performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by UBS Financial Services or its affiliates and
not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of
stock or stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser,
subject to certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's
discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of
UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services. In general,
the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which
is necessarily weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include:
the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its Alternative Investment
Group; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to UBS Financial
Services derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed
by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute performance of the Fund and
such other accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio
Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative Investment Group; participation
by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio
Manager generally to colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula,
benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
