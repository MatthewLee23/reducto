LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders,
It has been said that change is the only constant in life. As investors have
seen, that theme is still accurate today as we recently have experienced
shifting economic cycles because of natural disasters and political
instability around the globe.

Markets worldwide have fluctuated in the past year as devastating hurricanes
had a dramatic effect on the international economy, particularly on oil
prices. We witnessed political unrest in the Middle East, highlighted by
instability in Iraq, and in Africa, the usually stable Nigeria also
experienced violence. As a result, energy prices have bounced up and down,
with crude oil prices at one point topping a record $70 per barrel.

Such cycles are not uncommon and in fact have almost become the norm
in our everyday lives. What does all of this mean to you as an investor?
In times like these, it helps to know that you're working with a seasoned
investment professional who has experience to guide you through difficult
times. At MFS(R), we believe our investment management team has the knowledge
and confidence to navigate through difficult cycles and at the
same time see through adversity to find investment opportunities for our
clients and shareholders.

Our investment management process, honed over 80 years, combines a unique
concept of teamwork with our unwavering focus on the long term. We firmly
believe that the best way to realize long-term financial goals - be it a
college education, a comfortable retirement, or a secure family legacy - is to
follow a three-pronged approach that focuses on longer time horizons. Allocate
holdings across the major asset classes - including stocks, bonds, and cash.
Diversify within each class to take advantage of different market segments and
investing styles. Rebalance assets regularly to maintain a desired asset
allocation. Of course, these strategies cannot guarantee a profit or protect
against a loss. This long-term approach requires diligence and patience, two
traits that in our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many
opportunities the financial markets can offer - through both up and down
economic cycles.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

              Average Short Term Credit Quality            A-1
              ------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond price is likely to fluctuate with
    general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a fund with a
    5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this graphical presentation, the bond component includes
    both accrued interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any
    derivative holdings, if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which have
    been pre-refunded to an earlier date or which have a mandatory put date
    prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown takes into account
    these earlier dates.
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based on
    the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a security
    which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is considered
    Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency mortgage-backed
    securities, if any, are included in a "AAA"-rating category. Percentages are
    based on the total market value of investments as of 4/30/06.

Percentages are based on net assets, including preferred shares, as of
4/30/06, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed, and current holdings may be different.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index - a market-value-weighted index
representative of the tax-exempt bond market.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset
value underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive
less than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As
a result, the total returns that are calculated based on the net asset value
and New York Stock Exchange prices can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes
as a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her
shares and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be
treated as gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of
shareholder capital have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and may
increase the trust's expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio's yield and share prices change daily based on the credit
quality of its investments and changes in interest rates. In general, the
value of debt securities will decline when interest rates rise and will
increase when interest rates fall. Debt securities with longer maturity dates
will be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter
maturities. Municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected
by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition
of the issuers and/or insurers of municipal instruments. These conditions may
include, for example, constitutional or statutory limits on an issuers ability
to raise revenues or increase taxes, anticipated or actual budget deficits or
other financial difficulties, or changes in the credit quality of municipal
issuers in the state. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of
a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements,
interest from the security could become taxable and the security could decline
significantly in value. Derivatives may involve risks different from, and
greater than, those of the underlying indicator's in whose value the
derivative is based. The value of the derivative may move in unexpected ways
and result in unanticipated losses and increased volatility if the value of
the underlying indicator(s) does not move in the direction or the extent
anticipated. Lower quality debt securities involve substantially greater risk
of default and their value can decline significantly over time. When you sell
your shares, they may be worth more or less than the amount you paid for them.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>


DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly
thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is a trust that is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
trust can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield securities rated
below investment grade. Investments in high-yield securities involve greater
degrees of credit and market risk than investments in higher-rated securities
and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions. Municipal securities
backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific
assets can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation
supporting the projects or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the
project or from the assets. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an
issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax
requirements, the security could decline in value, interest from the security
could become taxable and the trust may be required to issue Forms 1099-DIV.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Values of debt
instruments obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied
valuations and electronic data processing techniques, which take into account
factors such as institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities,
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other market data. Short-term instruments with a maturity at issuance of
397 days or less are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value. Swaps are generally valued at a broker-dealer bid quotation.
Securities and other assets generally valued on the basis of information from
an independent pricing service may also be valued at a broker-dealer
quotation. The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility for
determining or causing to be determined the value of the trust's investments
(including any fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to valuation policies
and procedures approved by the Board. If the adviser determines that reliable
market quotations are not readily available, investments are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with such
procedures under the oversight of the Board of Trustees. Under the trust's
valuation policies and procedures, market quotations are not considered to be
readily available for many types of debt instruments. These investments are
generally valued at fair value based on information from independent pricing
services. These valuations can be based on both dealer-supplied valuations and
electronic data processing techniques, which take into account factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data. The adviser may rely on independent pricing services or other
information (such as the correlation with price movements of similar
securities in the same or other markets; the type, cost and investment
characteristics of the security; the business and financial condition of the
issuer; and trading and other market data) to assist in determining whether to
fair value and at what value to fair value an investment. The value of an
investment for purposes of calculating the trust's net asset value can differ
depending on the source and method used to determine value. When fair
valuation is used, the value of investments used to determine the trust's net
asset value may differ from quoted or published prices for the same
investments.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from
derivative instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's
original cost. Derivative instruments include swap agreements.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party. Net cash
payments are exchanged at specified intervals and are recorded as a realized
gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. The value of the swap is adjusted
daily and the change in value is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation in the Statement of Operations. Risks may arise upon entering
into these agreements from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contract and from unanticipated changes in the value of the
financial index on which the swap agreement is based.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - Interest rate swap agreements are agreements
to exchange cash flows periodically based on a notional principal amount, such
as the exchange of fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest
payments, which are based on a specific financial index, or the exchange of
two distinct floating rate payments. The net receivable or payable associated
with these payments is accrued daily and recorded as an unrealized gain or
loss, and any payments received or made are recorded as realized gains or
losses, in the Statement of Operations. The primary risk associated with
interest rate swap agreements is that unfavorable changes in the fluctuation
of interest rates could adversely impact the trust.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and
original issue discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as
required by federal income tax regulations. The trust may receive proceeds
from litigation settlements involving its portfolio holdings. Any proceeds
received are reflected in realized gain/loss in the Statement of Operations,
or in unrealized gain/loss if the security is still held by the trust. Legal
fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the value of
a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal fees are
expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer, which are
generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of high-
yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount, for the six months ended April 30, 2006, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code, and to distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income,
including realized capital gains. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
tax is required in the financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically adjusted
for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character. These
adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share.
Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of income,
expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess of
net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and tax
purposes. Book/tax differences primarily relate to expiration of capital loss
carryforwards, amortization and accretion of debt securities, defaulted bonds
and capitalized workout expenses. The tax character of distributions made
during the current period will be determined at fiscal year end.

The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders is as follows:

                                      OCTOBER 31, 2005    OCTOBER 31, 2004
      Ordinary income (including any
      short-term capital gains)                $60,086            $171,028
      Tax-exempt income                     24,707,099          23,043,028
      --------------------------------------------------------------------

      --------------------------------------------------------------------

The federal tax cost and the tax basis components of distributable earnings
were as follows:

          AS OF APRIL 30, 2006
          Cost of investments                           $420,991,495

          Gross depreciation                              (1,821,349)
          ----------------------------------------------------------

          AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2005
          Undistributed tax-exempt income                  6,143,813
          Undistributed ordinary income                      181,879

          Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)      24,798,143

The aggregate cost above includes prior fiscal year end tax adjustments.

As of October 31, 2005, the trust had available capital loss carryforwards to
offset future realized gains. Such losses expire as follows:

              EXPIRATION DATE

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Municipal Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of investments,
as of April 30, 2006, and the related statement of operations, changes in net
assets, and financial highlights for the six-month period ended April 30,
2006. These interim financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2005, and financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period ended October 31, 2005, and in our
report dated December 22, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on such
statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights.

Gary A. Lasman          Portfolio Manager    April      Vice President of MFS;
                                             2006       employed in the
                                                        investment management
                                                        area of MFS since 2002;

                                                        2002.

Geoffrey L. Schechter   Portfolio Manager    2004       Senior Vice President of
                                                        MFS; employed in the
                                                        investment management
                                                        area of MFS since 1993

COMPENSATION. Portfolio manager total cash compensation as of April 30, 2006 is
a combination of base salary and performance bonus:

  o Base Salary - Base salary represents a relatively smaller percentage of
    portfolio manager total cash compensation (generally below 33%) than
    incentive compensation.

  o Performance Bonus - Generally, incentive compensation represents a majority
    of portfolio manager total cash compensation. The performance bonus is
    based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors, with more
    weight given to the former (generally over 60%) and less weight given to
    the latter.

      >> The quantitative portion is based on pre-tax performance of all of the
         accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the Fund and
         any other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-,
         three- and five-year period relative to the appropriate Lipper peer
         group universe and/or one or more benchmark indices with respect to
         each account. The primary weight is given to portfolio performance
         over a three-year time period with lesser consideration given to
         portfolio performance over one- and five-year periods (adjusted as
         appropriate if the portfolio manager has served for shorter periods).

      >> The qualitative portion is based on the results of an annual internal
         peer review process (conducted by other portfolio managers, analysts
         and traders) and management's assessment of overall portfolio manager
         contributions to the investment process (distinct from portfolio
         performance).

Portfolio managers also typically benefit from the opportunity to participate
in the MFS Equity Plan. Equity interests in MFS or its parent company are
awarded by management, on a discretionary basis, taking into account tenure at
MFS, contribution to the investment process and other factors.

Finally, portfolio managers are provided with a benefits package including a
defined contribution plan, health coverage and other insurance, which are
available to other employees of MFS on substantially similar terms. The
percentage of compensation provided by these benefits depends upon the length
of the individual's tenure at MFS and salary level as well as other factors.

in the table above.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MFS seek to identify potential conflicts of
interest resulting from a portfolio manager's management of both the Fund and
other accounts and has adopted policies and procedures designed to address such
potential conflicts.

In certain instances there may be securities which are suitable for the Fund's
portfolio as well as for accounts with similar investment objectives of the
Adviser or subsidiary of the Adviser. Securities transactions for the Fund and
other accounts with similar investment objectives are generally executed on the
same day, or the next day. Nevertheless, it may develop that a particular
security is bought or sold for only one client even though it might be held by,
or bought or sold for, other clients. Likewise, a particular security may be
bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling that
same security.

When two or more clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of
the same security, the securities are allocated among clients in a manner
believed by MFS to be fair and equitable to each. It is recognized that in some
cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Fund is concerned. In most cases, however, MFS believes
that the Fund's ability to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions for the Fund.

MFS does not receive a performance fee for its management of the Fund. MFS
and/or a portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate favorable or
limited opportunity investments or structure the timing of investments to favor
accounts other than the Fund--for instance, those that pay a higher advisory
fee and/or have a performance fee.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase Fund shares
annually. The notification to shareholders of the program is included in the
semi-annual and annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs
begin on March 1st of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule
10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of
shares that may be repurchased in each annual period (March 1 through the
following February 28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the
first day of the plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of Fund shares
available for repurchase for the March 1, 2006 plan year are 3,994,370.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send

Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrant's
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the

    the filing date of this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal financial
    officer and principal executive officer have concluded that those
    disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the
    material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on this
    report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
    forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit.

    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of
    Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification
    will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under

   statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
   were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
   information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
   the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and
   cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement
   of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
   this report;

4. The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
   establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
   in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
   control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
        disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
        supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
        registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
        us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
        which this report is being prepared;

     b. designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
        internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
        supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
        of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
        external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
        principles;

     c. evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
        procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
        effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of a date
        within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
        evaluation; and

     d. disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting that occurred during the second fiscal
        quarter of the period covered by the report that has materially
        affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
        registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
   registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
   directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a. all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
        record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
