SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2005

1.   SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES

     BMC  Fund,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is a closed-end, diversified investment
     company  registered  under  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     Prior  to  becoming  a  regulated  investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
     Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary of
     significant  accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation
     of  its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

     A.   Investment  Valuations  -  The  investment  securities  are  stated at
          market  value  as  determined by closing prices on national securities
          exchanges.  Investment  securities  include  corporate  bonds,  mutual
          funds, and common and preferred stocks.

          The investments in limited partnerships, other investments and venture
          capital  are  stated  at  estimated  fair  value  as determined by the
          management  of  these  investments  and  are approved by the Company's
          Valuation  Committee  after  giving  consideration  to  historical and
          projected  financial results, economic conditions, financial condition
          of investee and other factors and events subject to change. Because of
          the inherent uncertainty of those valuations, the estimated values may
          differ  significantly  from the values that would have been used had a
          ready  market  value for the securities existed, and these differences
          could  be  material.

          The  carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries is
          based  on  an  independent  appraisal  of the fair market value of the
          subsidiaries.  Equity  in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
          the  statement  of  operations represents the current year earnings of
          the  subsidiaries  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.

          The  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  real estate is based on
          an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

     B.   Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for on
          the  date  the  order  to  buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
          losses  on  investments  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  specific
          identification  of issues sold or matured. The aggregate dollar amount
          of purchases and sales of investment securities, other than government
          securities  and  short-term  debt  securities having maturities of one
          year or less, for the six months ended April 30, 2005 was $79,828,751.

     C.   Income  Taxes  -  No  federal  tax  provision is required as it is the
          Company's  policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of the
          Internal  Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the distribution
          to its shareholders of substantially all of its income and any capital
          gains  not  offset  by  capital  losses.  Also,  no  state  income tax
          provision  has  been  provided because the states in which the Company
          has  income  recognize the tax exempt status of a regulated investment
          company.

1.   SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

     D.   Dividend  Policy  -  It  is  the  Company's  policy  to  pay dividends
          during  the  year  in  sufficient  amounts to meet the requirements to
          maintain its status as a regulated investment company.

     E.   Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of financial reporting,
          the  Company  considers all investments at financial institutions with
          original  maturities of three months or less to be equivalent to cash.
          Short-term  money  market investments managed by third party investors
          are  included  in  investment  securities.

     F.   Use  of  Estimates  -  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
          conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
          States  of  America  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
          assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
          and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
          financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
          during  the  reporting  period. Actual results could differ from those
          estimates.

2.   LINE OF CREDIT

     On  September  25,  2000  (modified  on  October  20, 2000 and renewed July
     21,  2004),  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with a bank for an
     unsecured  line  of  credit  in  the  amount  of $10,000,000 to provide the
     Company  more flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its
     investments.  The  interest  rate  on  any  borrowings will be at the LIBOR
     market  index  rate  plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on
     any  unused  balance.  As  of April 30, 2005, the Company had no borrowings
     from this line of credit, which expires on July 31, 2005.

3.   ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

     The  Company  does  not  have  an advisory board. The independent directors
     are  paid  an annual fee of $3,000 plus $1,000 for each meeting attended in
     person  or  $500  cash  for  each  meeting attended by telephone. Each such
     independent  director is paid an additional $1,000 for each day attending a
     committee  meeting in person or $500 by telephone other than on the date of
     a  board  meeting.  In  addition,  all  directors  are reimbursed for their
     reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings.
